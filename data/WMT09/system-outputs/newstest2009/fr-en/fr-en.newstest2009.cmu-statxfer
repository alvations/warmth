After the collapse of Tuesday morning, the award from Prague réctifia its losses. 
Transactions with shares ČEZ reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges. 
On Tuesday, at the start of trading, the award from Prague renoua with its downfall of the previous day, when it lost nearly six percent. 
This time, the fall was due to the collapse of the shares at Wall Street. 
The market reaction against the outcome of the vote in the House of Representatives of the United States, which refused to take the stabilization of the US financial sector, is so noticeable here too. 
Fall of shares in Asia 
The awards Asian lived Tuesday in a dramatic drop, even if indicators succeeded, in the course of the day, to erase some of the losses. 
The index Hang Seng of the award of Hong Kong lost four percent during the trading, but later, he effaça part of losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.

Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets up its monetary policy itself -- independent of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates have to Hong Kong the same level as the US. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. legislators should quickly resume the negotiations and adopt the proposal supports the financial system. 
Otherwise, we risk than other countries suffering the consequences. 
Bloodshed US stocks 
On Monday, the House of Representatives U.S. rejected the draft supports of the financial system, which she should have put up $700 billion (nearly 12 bilions of Kč) . 
Legislators renièrent and the appeal to the project supporter of President George Bush. 
But after Bush, the project would address the major causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole. 
American actions lived, Monday, a blood bath and major stock indexes met the largest drop in the last 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost almost 7 percent, have experienced a decline of such magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost already during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
Congress gave way: the Government of the United States can inject $700 billion in banks 
The leaders of Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of the agreement of financial assistance to the US financial system. 
It will be submitted for a vote early next week. 
U.S. legislators was a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of funding in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) given to the US financial system. 
The success is by no means secure. 
Indeed, prior to publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan supports of the financial system will be reviewed Monday in the House of Representatives. 
In Sunday to the Reuters news agency Barney Frank, the chairman of the banking and financial regulation of the House. 
Sources say, Wednesday at the earliest, the plan must a priori be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
However, considering the complexity of the mechanisms through which the assistance to markets may be effective, will follow a `` disillusion ". 
Paulson: It should be effective 
" We have made great progress. 
We settled our differing opinions regarding the shape of the package of measures to stabilise the market, '' assigned to the Agency Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
In its view, the final vote could be done by Sunday. 
In the Saturday night at, representatives of lawmakers met the Minister the US Treasury Henry Paulson, to give the government bottom final form. 
He should make amends, with financial companies, real estate unmarketable leading financial firms in significant losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
" We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that works and that should be, also, effective on the market. 
It should also pursue this recovery plan markets, but I think we have, '' said Paulson. 
A signal to the Asian trade 
The global financial crisis has a great impact on the stock market falling. 
According to the senator did democrat évadiez Harry Reid, lawmakers are so that Congress might end up with a definitive agreement by Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are based in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect trade Monday. 
For now, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when both Houses of Congress will hold their vote, or if the negotiations can not remain blocked at the last minute, such and such a problem. 
Legislators expect that it will be adopted in the days to come. 
Nevertheless, the law will still in many changes. 
The total amount for aid system needs to be divided into two parts. 
The first $350 billion, as wished by President George Bush, should be available as soon as possible. 
But, if Congress the impression is that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the granting of the remaining amount by following two stages: first $100 billion additional and, in conclusion, 350 billion. 
Mr. Bush salua the progress in the negotiations 
Although the President may put her veto decision, the Congress, for its part, has the opportunity to put it in minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the program, which was to obtain finance on the redemption of the bad mortgage debt, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
" All work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to get through Sunday to vote on the legislation, and the Senate Monday, '' told the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
The U.S. President George Bush himself pleased of the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made Saturday and appreciated " l'effort two-party to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy ''. 
Limitation of golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of financial program, the contributor protection against losses, the rebates agreement, the course of the plan on the time axis. 
The new law also limits so-called golden parachutes for the heads of companies in the program, and it set up a committee, which will carry out monitoring of funds. 
The latter should be managed by the Department of Finance. 
" We have worked very hard on this issue and we have made good progress towards an agreement that work and be effective for the market and for all Americans ', '' said Paulson. 
The plan also includes aid for homeowners, who have problems to pay. 
The Government should negotiate new installment in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while decreasing the monthly payments and receivables by allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek A psychologist 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult. 
" And that is because you don't know what the mechanism and the repurchase price of assets to problems. 
This will be crucial in deciding the loss sharing between the financial sector and the government, '' said Marek, this week in server iHNed. Republic. 
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, Marek, not really all that serious. 
" It is much more important that the congressmans to agree; this week, they support this plan and this will soon as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, the most important thing at the moment, '' stressed Marek. 
A fight taken to extremes: MP3 players against mobile. 
We advise you, how to choose 
While virtually all the mobile can read MP3 files, no text messaging unclear call. 
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone. 
But it is sufficient reason to obtain an independent player. 
The choice depends entirely of the usage and requirements of the new owners. 
It would be absurd to buy for the house a gramophone expensive of high-end to put the new album Maxim Turbulenc. 
However, such musical products remain on vinyl record, and, in terms of quality, there are no objective grounds, to make that happen. 
Well, if there in your racks of vinyl albums crowded, with of art rock, jazz or blues, you dream at least likely such a gramophone. 
The same goes for music for travel, namely of music, compressed to about simplified music in MP3. 
There are also classes on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for one reader, the way a fan of Pink Floyd would be hard to bear headphones purchased for twenty kroner market. 
These two extremes, between which there is enough room for everybody. 
The choice is wide. 
The life of the battery is also decisive 
Some music players at the highest level are capable of much more than just a music reading up, but this is of unknown function, of course, most of the mobile. 
No current device is more universal than the telephone. 
A side of the primary functions, telephone calls and the sending of SMS, it is capable of reading of music and films, registering them, he owns a camera of uneven quality and may, for example, to be used in navigation. 
And if we take account of Smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer. 
Because no frigidaire unclear broiler meat and that no television will photographs, we see almost a miracle. 
However, the universality of mobile is not without disadvantages. 
Over the number of functions that you use it, the more than between rechargements will be reduced. 
And reading music is one of the goinfres of energy the most important. 
A few mobile who are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, for most, this is substantially less than. 
Here, readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are much more powerful. 
In the case of cheap mobile, but they will of music for a few hours. 
In addition, if you are going to call from time to time, get, to be safe, a second recharge to the job-and that this is true even for the most expensive appliances. 
There should be no problem for MP3 players, who are able, after a recharging, a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including underperforming. 
Another problem arises from the music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, a limited proportion of appliances has a connector universal USB, particularly as not all can not be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
There is, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but little of card readers are taking no reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile. 
For those readers, you need, without exception (iPod) of any software. 
Simply fill in the connector USB device, music from the computer. 
Most of mobile, and readers will create their own a media library sorting by the name of the performer, the title of the album, and the style, or of the judgment of the user. 
Some systems do have an index with a tree structure, in the manner of the Windows Explorer, others are capable of iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system) . 
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile have more know-how 
In the selection of an instrument concrete, look mainly to the life of the battery, to the ability of memory, to the quality and type of release of his and, of course, to ease of control. 
If the music is for you, in essence, a background noise and if in the day you will hear for a limited time for example, by the tram, please any mobile reading. 
Virtually all mobile in can now. 
You are not even have to make too much attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and most of the music that is going to get you is just that format. 
It is part of formats the most common and hand him, the vast majority of devices happens to read also music of Windows Media audio format. 
The (AAC format used by the firm Apple and its iPods) is less common. 
The mobile high end can also, for example, the purchase of online music. 
A visit, since the mobile phone, web pages of the operator (or other supplier) corresponding and buy the song or the album. 
This service to alone should be a compelling reason to get a mobile music. 
The operators offer is, unfortunately miserable and is confined, for the most part, to of radio tubes fast facts. 
Prices are also lower. 
However, it is generally believed that this way to buy music (whether by GSM, Internet, and wireless Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people still carry their mobile on itself. 
Every time you want to listen to something, you have to leave the mobile of your pocket when you forgot your MP3 player at home. 
It is also important if you are still on your headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in cabinets, as have virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is price. 
The cheaper cost normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three to four thousand kroner, can be a walkman already very suitable. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of exit for standard headphones. 
The price of the best phone, and better equipped, staffed also an entry for standard headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand. 
Readers, however, have the advantage of being an easy drive. 
Truly anyone happens to ensure control of readers most rudimentary that may not correspond to cheaper (see our choice) . 
A minimum of duties; and the similarity of the order from a position cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet connected by chance, followed by an invoice from huge data transmission. 
Which devices choose 
Even the mobile the cheapest (e.g. The Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for memory cards per the type M2, microSD. 
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kroner. 
But be careful of it. 
Models of basic support in principle that of cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive is faring well with memory cards from 8 GB. 
If you already have a mobile and want to buy an MP3 player cheap, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver. 
In terms of the domestic (max. 2 GB) , do not spend more than 1,100 crowns. 
If you are one of the most challenging listeners, choose of mobiles-walkman specialized (Sony Ericsson, certain Nokia and Samsung) . 
These machines are equipped with independent control keys for MP3 and this is the ease of the order is similar to an MP3 player independent. 
Sony Ericsson, whose motives of the series walkman have the same user menu that MP3 players sold separately, is that has gone further in this area. 
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life of the battery (normally 3 p.m., up to 35 hours) above, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands noted above. 
A first virtual operator win the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in western Europe. 
Despite that, is there still something-a virtual operator, that would require the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that there are bound for a long time. 
We have already mentioned on several occasions, on Mobil. Republic that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The ČTÚ (L'Office Czech Telecommunications, who reported that the price of a SMS was higher here than in the rest of the European Union, has confirmed. 
Thus, following the latest not of the Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur SMS from abroad will for some clients of mobile operators Czech cheaper than domestically. 
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic is still so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, missing a competition that would very much like to go into battle. 
It may seem paradoxical, given that we have still three mobile networks and a penetration far greater than 100% . 
Instead, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council Office Czech telecommunications (ČTÚ) who said on several occasions that in the Czech Republic there was no need for another operator, is join the operators. 
It is probably true that a trader classic with its own network apparently did not much chance (d'ailleurs, now, it matched only frequencies difficulty) . 
However, there still is a possibility a virtual operator. 
This is, in fact, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market which resulted in a dramatic decrease in price, which would, in turn, deal also traditional operators. 
Yet, even before the entry of trouble-fêtes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, votes that are similar to what we mean here is suggested in Britain. 
However, it emerged that there was room for such operators and that they could be a real success. 
We do have not have to go look too far for examples. 
In February we we informed you of the launch in Poland, the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In just six months, this operator has won more than 100 000 customers and becoming the fifth operator. 
Also behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns the U: Fon in Tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators with the opportunity to focus on a target group much more practical. 
In order to operate effectively, they need to far fewer clients that a trader classic. 
They are, in fact, free of charge of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network, relatively high. 
As a result in the world, virtual operators appearing as operators to lower costs-they offer calls and text messages cheap, which is often counterbalanced by a service offering limited. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as indicated by the of Mobilking in Poland, built upon an audience unusual can also be a good publicity coup. 
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men. 
" Real men prefer Mobilking an operator who they like and whom to trust, '' said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operator this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say if such a concept could walk home. 
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, in doubt, `` The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, that is used for the majority of virtual operators. 
Especially as it is relatively saturated in terms of the provision of services. '' 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the mobile operators 
It seems almost for certain that there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not Mobilking. 
" We discuss the expansion of this project to succeed, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very sponsor. 
The launch of Mobilking will rather in other countries of our area, '' said in a telephone conversation for Mobil. Republic Jana Studničková, group spokesman financial Penta. 
It has thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not support this idea. 
Instead, they are trying to do all they can to that a potential competitor can emerge. 
The group GTS Novera, wishing and able to take a step back to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the area of business clients, no secret, long enough, plans to launch a mobile operator virtual. 
" We attach great importance to be able to offer our customers not only of fixed-line telecommunications services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already engaged in negotiations about this opportunity on several occasions with the Czech mobile operators. 
There, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, '' said the spokesman Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is therefore potentially promising. 
Based on information informal, it seems we could perhaps host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for now, its creation was accompanied by a total silence. 
" At the moment, we do not consider there to be any room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific. 
Currently, no matter with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted, '' said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in return for Mobil. Republic. 
Others operators in connection to the specificity of the Czech market. 
The spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: `` We have not registered for the moment of viable plans and bilaterally beneficial, which could serve as a basis for. '' 
And she said: `` It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator is being discussed on the network of T-Mobile by the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of time so limited, we should have now tangible agreement. '' 
Vodafone leading to his attention about the execution of requests for a separate licence 3G. 
Miroslav Čepický said in this connection: `` We are open to negotiating with potential virtual operators, particularly in the area of costs and infrastructure shared. 
That is what, in our view, means most of intakes from the perspective of clients. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area since the discovery of a partner in establishing a common network for a mobile Internet fast. '' 
Officials: in line with the operators 
The approach of mobile operator is readily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase of competition, would conducted to lower prices and therefore to a reduction in their income. 
What good is facilitated the introduction of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, the operators know be interpreted larrons in show. Their spat with the creation of the U: Fon also visible. 
Most apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, with the creation of the U: Fon, was that carried on by the company T-Mobile. 
In testimony on publicly available information from websites ČTÚ. 
Now, the U: Fon lend itself to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová has noted in this regard: `` The competition in the mobile market has been, in addition, recently exacerbated by the entry of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of mobile market in TN, it is obvious that adding an extra player submit, and especially its services, high standards. '' 
But given the attitude of mobile operators which are, indifference regulators Czech confusing. 
That, however, is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike in Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It belongs only to the Office for the Protection of economic competition (ÚOHS) . 
However, it passed, faced with this problem, its position typical. 
" Entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the operator virtual in question about renting the necessary infrastructure. 
No such agreement was reached at the moment, because the supply of potential bidders do priori not presented enough interest for traditional operators, '' said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa Department of External Relations ÚOHS. 
A statement made no surprise not the part of representatives of operators. 
But the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also caring properly, that no one is taking advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing. 
All the more so since Kristián Chalupa adds: `` Abroad, where the virtual operators are likely to be present, it can be seen that come on the market has contributed to falling prices of mobile telephony. '' 
However, lobby for an honest functioning of the market and lower prices is apparently not part of the interest of ÚOHS. 
What is really shocking is the consistent almost touching of three mobile operators, stemming from their reactions. 
The question, this is really a coincidence, naturally arises. 
Meanwhile, the price of petrol strictly identical to all service stations is surely by chance and hard struggle of competition. 
" L'office has not been identified to sign of behaving anticompétitif, it is not the right to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators there of a dominant position, none has therefore appropriate accountability increased its market behavior. 
Tools for the opening of the market mobile virtual operators are probably even in telecommunications regulator, '' said in his statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ that telecommunications are, from the viewpoint of economic competition, one. 
None of the Czech operators there of dominant position in such a market. 
But some law experts suggest differently: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it must be available at all times, the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has not surprisingly monopoly on their network. 
Thus it is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of its business. 
But even without admitting that argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly much the same way. 
But the complaints of many stakeholders (including the company GTS Novera, as mentioned earlier) show they face, in the negotiations with all operators of similar constraints. 
Bring back the responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common tower in communications, whereby the ÚOHS washing his hands of the affair. 
We have already seen this type of attitude in many similar cases. 
It has unfortunately not managed to increase in the novélisation of the Telecommunications Act, passed recently, an extension of the powers of ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, representatives of ÚOHS must very well know, their interests are apparently. 
When nobody is watching, it can walk 
However, the operation of some operators so-called virtual, many in the Czech mobile networks, yet unnoticed. 
It is companies making their own list of the price of mobile telephony, but they are public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of the firms involved in the multi-level marketing. 
As mobile telephony particularisés are available for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others. 
The list prices of these firms only manage generally than elected. 
The magic trick lies in the fact that the company before the operator is of a client traditional business, which requires a lot of SIM cards. 
As a major client, it gets offers of prizes (and others) special. 
The problem is that business conditions of all mobile operators Czech prohibit such a resale. 
" If happen what you are talking about, it could be a breach of contractual conditions that we would consider and that could lead to a shutdown of the collaboration with the company in question, '' has responded to our questions concerning this problem Martina Kemrová. 
It is equally unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not been able to makers of mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, speaks out against such a procedure. 
In fact, the activities of these firms their of benefit non-négligeables, and, at the same time, as opposed to virtual operators real, they do threaten not with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický identifies potential problems: `` The law allows this kind of speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of clients negligible. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their names, it may not have full, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators. '' 
However, that's precisely which should seem strange to ČTÚ. 
In addition, there is another issue at ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to share power such an activity, and if he does not wish to be satisfied with explanations of operators, who say no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions the prohibition. 
When we will no longer be the most expensive place 
As we already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has been a significant reduction in the price of services. 
However, virtually all countries in which appeared virtual operators, traditional operators were endeavoring, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their formation. 
The arguments used by them were about the same, too small a market, or too busy, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
It is at this level that have contributed, in developed countries, regulatory bodies, who had not the interests of the mobile operators, but those customers. 
As well as formal steps that by an informal pressure, they eventually get the creation of a virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, regulatory bodies Czech this respect to the manner of a potato hot which are disposed of in the passing at a target near. 
Based on our experience, we can not get away from the impression that the confusion in the competence is in these cases more than beneficial. 
But do must not give up so easily. 
If the details of behind-the-scenes say true and a virtual operator will appear soon in the Czech mobile market will probably move. 
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS can only with difficulty remain inactive in rejecting (discrimination) others. 
And we stop may call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new anthem Czech four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Well the four achievements of the new version of the National Anthem Czech. 
Sunday Day, Czech citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented solemnly the new registrations of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland.

The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the town. 
He said in the peri-urban train and bus 300 to 499, that use essentially the inhabitants of Commons of Bohemia Central to access the capital. 
" The trains integrated Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport of Prague) controllers are equipped of card readers, with which they demonstrate the validity temporary and zonal coupons; '' said tickets control Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, who designs the schedules of public transit pragois. 
The peri-urban buses are equipped of card readers integrated into the driver cash. 
At the boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show in chip to the driver, but we should also place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the cash. 
This is why the driver controls the validity of registered coupons. 
" Where the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than to require the information to the driver, '' compléta Drápal. 
Passengers who are not taking the bus peri-urban and not remember not the date expires the validity of their coupon, can re-enter the vending machines, initially used to record the coupon on the map. 
This is, on the screen of the device that will display information concerning the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten demanding a referendum in the United States 
The the Sudeten Germans called in 1945 what Šumava be built in the US. 
This is for a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Science Library of Bohemia in the South) . 
If we can not be part of Germany or Austria, we do at least want to live under management in the United States of America. 
In 1945, some groups of the Sudeten Germans were supposedly in the US president with such a desire. 
This is due, among other of a letter preserved in a private archive, which is filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
The Germans of eský Krumlov pray in the letter the US President not to allow that '' (t) šumavská župa " (forest region south of Bohemia)-annexed by Hitler under the Munich accord-is made to Czechoslovakia. 
" We understand the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come on German territory not oppressors and enemies, but as liberators, '' is written in the letter, signed " People, which the fate of the Šumava like to the heart ''. 
Since rallying to the Czechoslovakia it was allegedly promising-with the national character Czech-that of brutality, of attitude poorly, misunderstood, of oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urged the US President in his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever. 
" We do not believe that you would that territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroyed minorities and which has done nothing at the Allies victory without taking into consideration the views of quarter of a million of people, '' is written in the letter. 
The purported reason for which the authors can not sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge `` oppressors Czech ". 
If the US president doubted the opinions of Germans of Šumava, there to organize, the author of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine if its people wanted to be part of the USA, or live under management in the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter may, in the light of current knowledge of's post-war history, seem somewhat naïve, said some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time. 
Whilst the Germans Czech had at least suggested that the question their eviction from the republic arose, very few said such a possibility. 
Some waited for the US and Britain would get for the Sudeten some sort of autonomy. 
Others believed they would quite simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, the dinner. 
During the war, he was, as a German České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic states. 
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the camp taking of the region Holstein, dozens of Germans Czech were checking to they learn Czech. 
" They thought that once back at home, the Czech would be profitable, '' says Chalupa. 
None of the Germans captured living in Czechoslovakia before the war was, he said, that after the Orders Bene, it would be expelled from Georgia. 
You not considering you pay! 
An emotional campaign attacks the drivers 
The action for road safety the most expensive in the Czech history. 
One way to characterize the media campaign emotional than for the launch, Wednesday, the Department of Transportation. 
The Office of the Minister Aleš Řebíček thinks it will discourage drivers from dangerous behavior while driving. 
The campaign cost $150 million will appear on television, radio, in theaters, on the Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should deter drivers from the conduct quick and drinking and driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt off. 
It is especially touching the conscience of young drivers, motorcycle, pedestrian, and professional drivers. 
This that will appear in the spots? 
Mostly personal stories that will address the emotions. 
Witness also the slogan `` bloody " of the entire campaign: 
You not considering you pay! 
The phrase `` You do thoughtfuln't '' is listed clearly on the registration plate. 
Then, in a flaque of blood, there is the phrase `` You paieras ". 
What is to symbolize as you can pay of life a moment of inattention. 
The spots will " haunt " the spectators 2010. 
The Department was inspired by a similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where people can see commonly of pictures with imagery drastic victims of accidents. 
It is believed that this will lead to a drop in injury rate and the number of road deaths Czech. 
The spots were created by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy sugar and whip against drivers 
" What does work with operators, it is the system sugar and whip. 
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the fact of saving time when grillent a red light. 
The whip, is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks should be reminded of the drivers, '' said Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce. 
Thus there is a need for information campaigns in the press and mostly negative ads, says psychologist. 
The signs pointing out the danger to drivers are, he said, already less effective. 
" When static sign that warned against the danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers do see more, '' reported Kořán. 
Olmert would for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, President of the interim government Israeli, himself in favor of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
He made his comments in an interview published Monday in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
" We need to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to make almost all jurisdictions (employed) , and to all, '' said Olmert day-to-day. 
" We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory, because without it, the peace will not be, '' he said. 
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem. 
" Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want tractors and bulldozers him crush the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will need to relinquish parts of Jerusalem, '' noticed Olmert referring to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred places and historic '' located outside the Old City. 
" Anyone wanting to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
It will not work, '' he stressed afterwards. 
Retreat from the Golan Heights 
Olmert himself also in favor of retirement of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is, he says, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
" I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of a retirement the Golan Heights, '' reported he. 
" The Syrians know very well what they are going to have to forgo to get the Golan. 
They will have to give up its current relations with Iran; they will have to manage without their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement) ; they will have to quit supports constant they place on terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement) of the Al-Kaïda (terrorist network) , as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, '' added the Prime Minister. 
Questions that arise after the accident: The stewards in the because are they illegal? 
The law ignores, walk in a as long distance is prohibited 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of society Student Agency near Padua, Italy, arises the question whether the stewards and passengers can during transport be moved within the bus. 
" If we were law abiding strictly and formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act, '' said the spokesman of the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, during which has died a hostess aged 22, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that was cross the path of the bus. 
The young girl was at this time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, the seat in the most dangerous of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
But the coach may have an accident, or abrupt manner brakes, as well as the steward is the coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What matters is whether the coach is under its Fact Sheet equipped of seats rose. 
If this equipment to toilet seats is not approved, passengers must sit. 
Coaches long distance Student Agency not available seats standing; this was confirmed to Aktuálně. Republic manager of the firm Radim Jančura. 
" This is an issue that we have dealt with the department and, initially, it prohibits passengers travel. 
Then they have canceled and we have achieved that passengers can go to the bathroom during transport provided they have their own seat, '' he unveiled its position. 
The law ignores the steward 
" There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of steward role-no legal requirement does this role. 
Furthermore, no legal requirement does not prohibit the carrier to offer services. 
The legislation on road transport is only the recipient term car; it does not define its rights and duties, '' said with more ambiguity the spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the department head of the circulation of road vehicles, think that the law deals adequately the problems. 
" This depends on whether the bus was on its certification leave to move the markets rose. 
All lies in there, '' he said. 
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are places rose and a top speed limited, long-distance with seats rose and a speed higher authority and in coach long distance without rose place with the maximum speed limit the highest seats and fitted with seat-belts. 
As the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, expert at BESIP (road safety of the) in transportation safety, does not see the stewards travel aboard a major problem. 
" At a steady flow, there is no danger. The situation is comparable to that of service on flights. 
Here, too, it is unclear when will turbulence and the hostess of the air can beat your head. '' 
" However, where the bus would abrupt manner drag, the laws of physics would obviously valuable. 
In the same manner as a city bus or a tram. 
The carrier will manage the security of stewards of internal requirements, '' he said and also think from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved. 
Jančura is prepared to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier bus to propose the services of stewards. 
He in hiring two hundred. 
Even after the crash, the Director does not consider their job as a trade. 
", however, as soon as I have the impression that this is a trade at risk, I supprimerai. 
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding. 
It would reduce expenses as well, '' he said. 
Safety is due to the lack of stewards in its vehicles director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which provides, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines. 
" We have no hostesses. We oppose this since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident, '' he said, there is a years to Týden. Republic. 
A great tragedy has arrived 
A young hostess Region Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A truck Slovenian probably equity the emergency standstill without use of flashing and it has blocked the road to the bus. 
The driver to try to avoid using an abrupt maneuver, but it was almost with his right hand. 
Jančura refuses the two seats reserved for the rest of stewards have been sold. 
" In the case of lines long distance, it is not possible to reserve these seats, are stuck. '' 
The company will sue the truck driver. 
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency doesn't wait for the court judgement, but as regards the financial compensation, it also relies on the guilty. 
An amendment of the law? 
Not in order 
An amendment of the law, which is currently being developed for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, may provide clarification on the stewards travel aboard the bus. 
" But it did not result in any specific conclusion on this point. 
Actually, they are not interested enough to buses, but rather to a points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of portable at the wheel, '' said the expert Hořín. 
" The Department of Transportation does not consider the stewards activity as something that would materially jeopardize the safety of passengers, '' the spokesman Hanzelka, stating that control of the bus safety is in the hands of the police and the Office for the occupational safety. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
Key words no lack in the letter by the Steering Committee of the WestLB to employees of the house. 
By a entities union of the Institute Düsseldorf Financial with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, `` the institution central's capital markets Financial Group Sparkasse " can be by e-mail made public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a bloc of responsibility '' and a sustainable productivity in such a matter. 
After all, such a relationship could be the start turning to other levels in the banking sector and Länder. 
For what it was like when a committee board wishes to demonstrate its capacity to act in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, injured, is still feeling intense pressure. 
Not only the European Commission but also the federal authority of Monitoring of Financial Services who has, it only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land Rhenanie of Nord-Westfalie that time was ticking in seeking a solution future. 
However issue for some time-as from Frankfurt-a relationship of some sort between the bank Deka, who knows clients of the Sparkasse of by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Although the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas said at the presentation of half-year figures late August that he had no sense in the merger of the house of Mainzer Landstrasse with a state bank, whatever the Helaba or the WestLB. 
However the Board of Directors Deka, which each half is borne by the banks of the Länder and by groups of savings funds, instructed the Steering Committee lead of the talks with WestLB to common commercial activities. 
It might be of flow of the financial market, or parts of it. 
Talks however, have only begun, told in the financial center. 
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the biggest employers on the financial center of Frankfurt, comes in lorqu'il is question of sector consolidation of savings funds. 
In 2003 there thought for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank's Rhineland Land Rhineland Palatine and the Halbab. 
Nothing is nonetheless evident from this display ternary. 
Hardly plans had they been made public that the Government of the Land of Hessen was voting against the involvement in the Hellaba. 
Subsequently, the other two houses not be rejoignèrent. 
The bank's Rhineland Land Rhineland Palatine was linked to the place to the bank of the Land Bade-Wuttenberg Stuttgart. 
But there were always new talks on reuniting of the Deka-Bank with banks of the Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, Chair of the Steering Committee of the Hellaba, was however decided against any business strategy of merger with its bank. 
Quite apart from that, the sense seems to spread that the grouping of different schools of public sector is particularly pressing. 
Now that the election to Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land Bade-Wuttenberg might arise in the first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure that forced to new mergers would increase, potential partners beyond his to lose. 
In the south, it would be a junior partner, although it has so far been more resilient to the crisis as banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The consolidation of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, has instead fired a bolt at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
We would then have to the rigor the NordLB. 
These kinds of issues geo-strategic is but one element in a vast array. 
Another aspect is the question of how the different business models of each of these banks could be supported. 
In June, Merl said that the crucial question, namely through what business model the future ability of banks of the Länder should be assured, had not heretofore been resolved by the consolidation of the German savings funds and transfers. 
Ultimately, a butchering of the WestLb could take place, butchering which here is not wanted. 
That is, this is the focus of the committee letter board in place: in any event, would be within a solution globale' to the establishment. 
How will this be lumped together with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the festival of beer is also known as the weekend of Italian. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena goes with in that capacity girlfriend, and nothing is the same, he said. 
Behind them, close to a barrel of five litres of beer brand Kaiser is a bearded well built showing with about 200 guests Day of beer what sounds profound his gosier can produce.

The package costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a beer Kaiser, brewed in accordance with the law of purity Bavarian, health insurance and a head of group German speaking-Marco did a language courses in Frankfurt. 
And already the bus driving into the night on the Autostrada management at Brennero'.

There was a need to be ready for the return. 
It is the second weekend of the festival of beer, known as the weekend of italiens'.

The police munichoise is reinforced by seven policemen of Tirol, South by rescuers Italian volunteers that support the Red Cross Bavarian making a statistic on the countries where the Italian take precedence before the British (60 interventions) and Austrian (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.

Nights insomnia for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago. 
What chance the politician used the word at relativement' and he fell as banking German would not spared by the crisis movements. 
It is indeed occurred this weekend. 
The financial house Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE) away in the DAX, gets a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from turmoil. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate will now pay interest on the amount at which it would be right. 
The money came from private banks extent that of banks of public law. 
In the background, it is the société-fille Depfa that bears the losses. 
The financial condition had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced very short-term for long-term goals for which he had borrowed money-which is no longer possible since because of distrust of the market. 
In the first half of 2008, the cash reserve of the bank had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million, the rate of own capital also had slightly weakened 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
Profits in the net from financial transactions were, compared to the same period last year, dropped to zero, profits derived from the allocation of loans and securities determined and the termination of a provision in the credit operations had fallen by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million. 
And it is only due to substantial profits from the reimbursement of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as payment of interest according to the White tax procedures and Commercial Acquisition for companies Konzern that the earnings shortfall of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate. 
Following its privatization in 1990, the former state financing had not initially speculated on credits Industrial Realty, which then had been filialisés to the bank Aareal. 
Because the state funding classic was not quite profitable, the Depfa had followed more closely in the infrastructure projects and in the funding of projects in common between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the société-fille, Hypo Real Estate to conduct write-offs that should have on calculating gains and losses of the group a material effect essential that remains quite unclear. 
The fact is that the dividends were amputated. 
For 2007, it was truncated to two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of Depfa, a state investor and highly important infrastructure. 
It is stronger than other institutes dependent of refinancing on the market inter-bancaire she has no customers filing. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks was again considerably spared, with banks accumulated its liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate is needed annually for some-about 50 billions of euros of the total resources of the Depfa a short-term refinancing. 
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the net borrowing of group is covered with the credit medium term and the company protected the influence of international markets financial largely out of working order now. 
Other sources say the refinancing would be maintained through funds until late 2009. 
The Chairman of the Committee Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke explained, however, that the group Hypo Real Estate should no longer have to commit financial markets in the medium term. 
The National Bank and the Blood Establishment federal for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the group's ability Hypo Real on the market is now assured. 
Shareholders and creditors of the bank with no hope. 
But because of the dynamic of the impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
This is not unthinkable that we do not have to seek financing from the whole scope. 
But the fact can not be overlooked. 
After that the bank, based on the latest headlines, yet at the gates of insolvency Sunday in the late evening, the rescue for the least interim will fail to reassure the minds either. 
The stock price has fallen by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros. 
The bond prices, by contrast, is doing particularly well. 
Whilst the debt in the first place have barely budged in the second loans plan drop. 
The worst affected are mostly the investment funds of the former société-fille Württemberg Hypo and those course that have a lifespan beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate seemed previously be a speculative investment alternative, now their value must be considered dependent system's stability international banker after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute who brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa. 
Until the issuing bodies, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, presumably a reduction of arrears in the time. 
Alternatively will not that anyone would hope for at the moment-that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But against noise updated of a partial nationalization, the likelihood that approached the safety is quickly becoming a mere hope. 
This should be reserved of sleepless nights before any to creditors long-term the decision of whether they have to part with their commitments. 
The short-term investors may still use of what they have drawn a line to be a loss carryover to the next few years on the next income taxes of capital gains stock automatically imposed. 
Sylvana and the Secrets of cans to Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, is to report to the first day at the Highschool of Tachibana, females experiment with pouffer laugh the German is so " kawaii "! 
What is it mean? 
Sylvana known already that word thanks to Mangas in his new Log exchanges, she describes Japan. 
" The first day in Japan. 
What is I was excited. 
Already the way to go to school made me fear. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in Kawasaki Management and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I find the way single-handedly, fortunately I did not lost. 
The start of course do not appear to be set in such a way as strict than here in Lower Saxony. 
Students appear one after the other from eight hours, until to nine hours least 20, a roundtable began with Professor, the `` home room ". 
But before the course start, it was up to me to introduce myself. 
I am not at all of its kind to like to speak in front of people, particularly in front of a class of 40 students. 
Because I had not yet the standard of school, I made an old skirt of my host mother and a shirt, socks rising blue and of leather footwear black. 
In this held therefore, I appeared before the console, and have tried all pronounce properly. 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ... '-I'm Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday was in a week. 
At that time, I was very pleased to have started to learn the language there two years. 
The 31 the female students were of low masses, pouffé laugh and signs fact, and I constantly hear the word `` Kawaii ". 
I already knew through my mangas. 
It is up to vocabulary vital to the survival of teens Japanese and means `` beautiful, cabbage ". 
Then I quickly slipped my place. 
The girl next to me made me a big smile ironic, it felt that it was an honor that the corresponding should sit next to her. 
The rest of the day was relatively calm, but when the Gong was music to the ears, I have been beset in the rules. 
Everybody was talking to that better, pouffait laugh and I did a lot of ground-and in this case it is somewhat difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, they all got their Bento. 
My host mother I was also doing this kind of Lunchbox-this is really something other than the miserable German snack. 
I rice to aromatic herbs, small sausage, a cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea of what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a seemingly bizarre and an entirely new taste. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Well, except for the plums salty confites, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches in schools Japanese. 
Sometimes a daughter offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and that is then developed particularly carefully in the hope of getting a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could see also here. 
" Why Japan in particular? '' have asked me my friends when I've been told that I wanted to spend a year in the classroom at Tokyo. 
I have always said: 
" Because it fascinates me, what '' 
Ultimately, read mangas, which is what I prefer. 
And to better understand the mangas and the culture there at one time, I also began to learn Japanese. 
For me, it was really clear that I had tourists a day. 
Because I also a low for the traditions, and traditions and customs. 
And here are of great importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country technologies and latest trends on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen. '' 
Rats also have sensation 
A rat or a down fled to the danger, this mean that there is also of fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux in is convinced that many animals have feelings. 
But how can anyone verify that it is the same thing when to behave the same way as we? 
In the magazine by the internet '' Edge '', contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE present in a series of articles of responses to the question `` What do you think be true without power evidence for? '' 
I believe that the animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without that I or anyone else has so far been able to prove just as we can not prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, there can at least hope that all human brains showed the same pattern. 
As soon as we look to other species and that we approach the issues of felt or in general of the conscience, we move in difficult terrain because the Hardware does not match. 
When a rat is before a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: it makes the death, fled or attack. 
Humans will behave in the same way, therefore several scientists deduce a subjective experience comparable. 
However, I have no faith. 
Two aspects of the brain structure render the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult. 
One aspect is that the associated circuits almost always to human consciousness include the Cortex lateral prefrontal (from participation in short-term memory and in senior management and delivery) . 
This vast region is much more developed for humans and other primates and seems to be entirely absent in others. 
All the less so for these aspects-ci our consciousness which depend on Cortex prefrontal, of which is aware of who we are, and the capacity to anticipate, decide, it is reasonable to assume that humans appear separately even other primates. 
Another significant feature could be the linguistic nature of Man: much of its existence is related to language, this often means that its conscience depends. 
In this case, you might exclude animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on language, it the influence relentlessly, so the animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, would differ probably much most of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is so difficult to determine to what may seem like the awareness among other animals. 
If this, internal and subjective, does not measure and, because of this Hardware particular, analyze in based on our own experience, then his comments we have considerable problems. 
Most of my developments refer to the content of lived aware, but there are also another aspect of consciousness should be readily accessible recognized. 
Consideration could the process of animals conscience regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization. 
But in this approach that ensued Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the focus is more on the neural correlates of the consciousness that on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of Cortex prefrontal in the achievement of viewing. 
But what is he then for the emotions? 
I find a system emotional kind the fear is activated by a brain aware of its own activity. 
This that we refer to as the `` fear '' is therefore the mental condition in which we find ourselves whether the activity of defense system located in the brain or its aftermath, as the body reactions) accounts of the RAM. 
As noted, the emotions are closely related to cortex areas surrounding the primates and particularly Islam. 
In subtle degrees of perceived, associated with our nature talkative, stand out because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and classify statements for the attribute to others to us. 
In contrast, Antonio Damasio example think the sensations from activities primitive born in areas of the body sensation of Cortex and brainstem, as Jaak Pankseep that focuses more on the brainstem. 
Because the Internet has not altered very much during human evolution, it could actually participated of cross-sectional sensations. 
That, in purely theoretical terms, I can not disagree, but I believe it indémontrable. 
Pankseep argues that what is as fears among Males and rats is probably also experienced as such in both cases: how yet to verify the rats and Men feel the same when they behave in a manner similar? 
A down fled to the danger, but if he felt fear? 
In my view, such behavior is not sufficient to establish of experienced identical. 
Of course, the comparison nerve assistance: rats and Men with trunks similar brain, cockroaches by against don't have a brain. 
But is the brain stem is at the root of these sensations? 
And even if we could prove it to mankind: how could it be demonstrated in rats? 
I think the rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches (who knows? ) have sensation. 
But I wouldn't know how the show. 
And because their feelings differentiate likely completely of us (as human consciousness based on special circuits and on the language) I prefer explore the emotional behavior that the emotional feelings of rats. 
In all cases, progress poignent on the nervous plan to the extent gauge the same rats and human. 
As I did not investigate the language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations of, I don't know if they exist. 
It may consider this as of the short-term, but I prefer to move on rather than knock constantly against a wall. 
I myself am a émotionel pragmatic.

For years, a mysterious phenomenon is because of uncertainty among researchers, the anomaly of the support gravity. 
The support of gravity is a maneuver space probes, where get an extra boost in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the earth. 
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The research probe américo-européenne Cassini-Huygens was using this trick physical, as the solar probe Ulysses. 
That surprised the researchers been for years: the flying objects do not always behave to 100 per cent of the way it looks as the venerable laws of gravity. 
Far more of the irregularities listed in the rate. 
Probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far, physicists could not explain. 
They referred to the anomaly of the support gravity. 
Some experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, who describes the power of attraction of the subject matter of the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still hard as iron that Einstein did was wrong not and trying to explain the anomaly of the support gravity to the assistance of the so-called dark matter astronomers have identified in the universe. 
" The dark matter could be responsible for this disorder, which is also located in the vicinity of the Earth ``, he wrote. 
Researchers of space know the existence of dark matter only for about ten years. 
He is apparently it an attractive prospect whose effect is observed on other celestial bodies. 
She, by contrast, is completely invisible that it would send or represent any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter would represent a fifth of the total mass of the universe.

The American general counsel appointed a accusing special to verify the question of the dismissal of nine American prosecutors in 2006

Michele of Milly, the voice of Avalon Bay, said that although the company intends to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that she wants to be the owner. 
" main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker that aisle abandoned, and made public '' she said, noting that it was the city to suggest the sale ''. 
Seth Donlin, a the voice of the Preservation of the Realty, confirmed that the city wanted to serve the street, noting also that the Agency's task was to develop the intellectual rather than manage it. 
Compared to its neighbor more colorful, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight mark history. 
Some believe that Extra Place this name since 1802, when the legacy of large farm numbers of children of Philip Minthorne was split, leaving aside this little piece of land that remained since abandoned. 
The subsequent entry of CBGB, a monument punk rock closed in 2006, has opened re to Extra Place, the street is certainly the most famous through the photo on its cover of the album of Ramones " Rocket to Russia '' 
" this place was beautiful " said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976 
She was full of scrap metal, of haillons, barrels, posters, sheet and strings. '' 
Some residents, including bloggeurs who had already spoken in the move toward the luxury of the East Village, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should be in public. 
Others have talked Extra Place as a true rareté- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be done in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who drives a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled " The White of Disputes An Eye Amèrement Nostalgique on A City in the Discharge process ") tracing the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: ` Extra Place is a small cul-de-sac narrow, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a warehouse in iron rusted and of blinds, full of newspaper last week that are soaring along the gutters. '' 
A few exceptions, the street was still up. 
A short rat agilement in the bottom of the alleyway, near a door that had once at CBGB, and that has now become the headquarters of a high-end clothing store. 
The graffiti on the walls, a beer bottle of 22 ounces empty, based in association of newspapers that have just been discarded. 
Some passers-by did think that rarely to Extra Place, and suggested in its development. 
Mr. Field, for its part, said that he thought some under felt the pull of the Street in its present state. 
" The best years of my life, '' he said, `` took place in dark areas wet and disgusting ". 
Seeding Bilingual: immersion in the English language 
In this part of the program Supervision of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates stand on bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former head of the Department of Education in Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book `` not as Bon that You do Pensiez. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their schools. '' 
Attracting favor with Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama noted that `` students African-American and Latino be less likely to diplômer that the white students. '' is a true. 
To combat these differences, curriculum of Mr. Obama supports particularly among so many other issues, `` Education transitional bilingual " for those learning English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire for a bilingual education behind the classroom instruction in languages other than English, will also its interest designed to remove the differences. 
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, a school in eastern county of Los Angeles. 
The students in this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low income. 
Over one-third of students made up many newcomers, is studying English. 
For students of CM1, 100% have passed the examination of State math of 2008, expert level. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of anglais-de langues-d'arts 
The hit was hit with another ingredient than that proposed by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street put on analyses of the practice, an ongoing assessment of the capabilities and an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr Obama might copy, reported Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school has implemented the instruction of English " full deep. 
The total immersion in the English-language centers on the almost constant use of the English language in education. 
Miss Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, He said assertive " we had a huge success with a student who just arrived from Mexico, 12 months, if you went without its class, you would have had no chance of identification. '' 
" That way, she says, `` it worked for us '' 
Mr. Obama shouldn't take example of Sixth Street Prep and replication in other schools composed primarily of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by the school speak for themselves, but policies on education inside his party (the Association for the Education National long argued language education) and its considerable support for bilingual education, obscure the prognostic response from Mr Obama. 
While it is in favor of the immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop wrangling on the language legislation in English. 
" On the contrary, he said, `` you must ensure that your child speaks Spanish ". 
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then it should consider carefully, models of education that fit, rather than shrugging aside or think of them as meaningless.

He watched the second time, when the Abrasive he a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
" I've never seen anything of this type '' said Ellis. 
The second time was begun after the Abrasive and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under shady clouds.

Gebrselassie depended, above her world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, the Ethiopian again proved to be worthy of his best runner of the bottom of the century, after beating his own world record in the marathon in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2 10:03: 59 a race accommodative on the flat, Gebrselassie broke of 27 seconds its record of 2:04: 26, competed last year in Berlin. 
A 35 years, Gebrselassie won the 26th of the world record of her successful career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance of 1600mètres the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- may be an unreasonable to see today-that air pollution is increasing its from asthma. 
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin. 
In conditions of almost parfaites- sunshine, 48 degrees at the start, 55 to the arrivée- Gebrselassie has won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The trail runners as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted bottom runners, contributed to the decrease marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2. 11:05. 
After the victory Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters have been hampered by cramps in calf two weeks before, and they missed the driving for a week. 
It is obvious that the rest allowed it remained brilliant, but not rusted. 
" I am so pleased, '' he told reporters. 
" Everything was perfect. 
I got last week, and now, I had doubts. But in the end, it's all gone for the better. '' `` 
He was reproché- especially in Kenya, the rival is's African Ethiopie- to have too orchestrate its shopping, avoiding stars marathon world, cash in fact on the hare as if they were in a trail competition, and considering more world records that the meaning of competition. 
But the criticism does not diminish the magnitude of capacity Gebrselassie as a background runner. 
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, had a time of 1: 02. half-way. 
Two elite runners in Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the lead compounds have disappeared. 
At a little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final rebound to detach from Kwambai, which ends up second in 2:08: 36, improving its best record staff of five minutes. 
Kamathis came third in 2 7: 48.

Last spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years, has surprised everybody won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She does could participate in the Games in Beijing because of a hypothetical back problems, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
She courut making use a clever strategy, leaving runners group Ethiopian and Kenyan take a great advantage, exceeding then about 18miles 1/2 after. 
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third in 2:25: 01. 
In a City to Share, Orgueil and tests Life Black 
Cache in the development of its huge park with a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a small town quiet where born the pride and complications of the African-American experience. 
" Eatonville, first fully black town to integrate, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she was in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today. '' The city in five lakes, three short of croquet, , 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and not of prison '. 
It has now become a pilgrimage city 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival held each year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the writer the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in many ways, the city she décrit- has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in tourist guides of the Florida edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers ' Project-remains a place. 
She is independent, credible, and private than it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston told that the rural population Florida Black was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, who `` we knew so little, don't know what they will lose ". 
While this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who was raised an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious's gaze foreign. 
" we are very careful about how to tell the tale '' said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident historically and the earliest paroissienne of the city. 
" it must be consistent with reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a triumph paradox and fighting. 
It represents both a historic model a takeover of black and a community of almost 2,400 persons where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
This is a key issue but also an example of rural culture black sudiste- a few times ignored, other times acclamée- which recalls the birth of American slavery. 
This would explain why the people are both proud and protective. 
Interest the image of Eatonville born with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston. 
She described her hometown to the world around of books sincere, full of dialect, such as `` Mules and Men " (1935) and `` " Their Eyes Were Watching God " nations. 
Five paragraphs in the guide Florida he this town, located just out of Route 17, a route through the center of Florida, often overlooked, which ends in terms of black history and of human drama. 
Audacieuse such a large cash in life as in the literature, Hurston led to readers to the intellectual store's first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
" last road on the left ', she writes, `` you can find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these play areas well maintained with Howard Miller has always paid attention, that we know barely literate. 
She was in addition reference in new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " sells beverages of all kind, and everything which can be used to shift people. 
So, in scarcely a hundred words, Hurston combined Eatonville to a car government but also to low literacy, remarriage, and gender. 
Of course, Fodor was not so. 
This was, in fact, not a picture that everybody disliked. 
Zora accurately described the real thing, '' said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls of Johnson that Hurston was immortalised, citing the songs without color, interpreted by men who chose their beauty. '' 
It added follows: '' some people were unhappy ". 
I remember always of Hurston as a strong person and eccentric, which returned frequently after her family has moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years, recalled that Hurston was usual in town without warning, aboard a full-size Chevrolet, a cigarette in your mouth and wore pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional dress. 
Many residents were fascinated, '' Mr. Franklin said, while much fun of her. 
" people were still happy to see Zora " he said. 
But he added that in addition, be swinging in his patio chair after giving on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston certainly was called `` that it wasn't too long time ''. 
By the death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out of production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed the have forgotten. 
Although it was once a star of the literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman's Barnard College of the 1920s, it was buried in a grave any, in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived. 
A Eatonville, no great commemorative plaque nothing to the general public. 
I do not think they understood the contribution or the legacy she offered in the world '' said Valerie Boyd, the author of `` Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Officials public Orange County wanted build a motorway to the five paths into the city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, the main street with two lanes of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already sent Interstate 4 to the west edge of town. 
The proposal was made whilst Eatonville recovered just a difficult period in its history. 
A forced integration, amongst many other things, has put an end to the isolation relatively idyllic community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute on the intermingling of the races led the hate to doors of the community. 
" at that time, a gang of white youths were launching of oranges or objects against people sitting on the side " said Mr. Franklin. 
" a woman has died. '' 
They launched a watermelon from their car ''. 
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to forced integration, outlining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education " insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race. 
Residents now shouting that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the confidence of youth. 
" black children used to be embrassés- I remember welfare it embraces our master the morning and evening also '' said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and director in charge of the Safety of the Community of Eatonville, a group not profit. 
It has taken, said she, until teachers and students do came more from the same site. 
" You do embrasses your professor Paper because it is blanc- I mean there is, a fine line ` cultural said Miss Nathiri. 
Civil rights, moreover, have helped to create space for many others Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who traveled along the affected, as it, military of a happy own confidence and courses of action such as: `` how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company. 
This is beyond me. '' 
In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker went on the anonymous graves of Hurston and began fighting to revive its reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston conducted by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, the réintroduisit to American guns. 
The project of the highway arrived at the time the girl the most famous of Eatonville had regained its appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston regard as a sauveuse. 
The community has started to organize a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would highway. 
Hundreds of fans have come to the opening of the festival two years, and many returning in January, for the commemoration. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal from the highway. 
" The fiasco of the highway to the five paths, extremely fast, a genuine civic pride " said Miss. Nathiri. 
Miss Boyd summed it stating that `` Zora saved Eatonville ". 
The victory over the project from the highway allowed him to increase his own image. 
A non-resident persons, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who frequently our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A library theme mono (renamed course Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for the Florida: to six miles of Orlando, it may at any time call itself a back street after in a rainy day summer, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s. 
(there are now 90 percent of blacks) 
Foreign nationals coming to discover the history of Eatonville, rationale, are still being treated with caution. 
They must request permission to most interview, and some choses- as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by white man, illustrating of black men in the champs- should not be photographed. 
Many to Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a teacher and courageous which has a low for the bright red, are still afraid that their island community not well understood. 
However, with the expansion of the festival Hurston, some degree of local pride is emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race. beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, crazy, mixed that the other ethnic and racial groups in America. 
This is good of the genuine civic condition that is in the voice of a nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, which plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or for Police Forces, who need additional forces. 
And even for younger, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned properly the description Eatonville. 
" Most people who go into the area there, think: ` Oh, this city have nothing compared to other `` Alondra Kenon said after the church last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a very beautiful city. 
Here in New York, all were fluent finance. 
Still, nothing has changed. 
Those in Manhattan were far from the booth, and giant screens television in Times Square, they do not make they are in the eye of the storm. 
Never they could not think that in the offices glass and honeycomb over their tète, bankers and managers of hedge funds that monopolize New York, spent the worse '' work day at the office? '' since the crack. 
The carriers continue to slip on the sidewalk, with their carts and their muffin trays for meetings matinières. 
The Latino are always between residental relating, as mules, about 50 shirts glossy pendues to a yoke willing on his shoulders. 
The office employees continue to stand in line to buy their sandwich matinier to street vendors, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays. 
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I décidai go open a new savings account. 
Fortunately that I had planned to working at the end of the afternoon, as I découvrais to my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people with the tail. 
Not to the cashier wicket, or to withdraw from the case, or make a payment, but to the customer window service, where the usual clients commanded their checkbooks, tourists asked management to the store Macy, and new customers opened of Auditors. 
Most of those before me, I learn later Starr, my ` personal banker `` authorization, were all the tail the same reason I do. 
Not the same way, because they had already taken their economies of smaller banks, like those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their cash out savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building society) of credit associations, and the type of savings banks local and their subsidiaries that only operate in a state, and who say treat customers as their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank's capital 327$ has resorted to the trustee in bankruptcy, and even though New Yorkers returning home for the week end the Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, for savings accounts worth of 440$ million, sought désespéramment a buyer to rescue it. 
The officers and employees of stores that are before me, frightened of another potential collapse, transferred money to a bank that they deem reliable, that is most rescue on Wall Street. 
Some New Yorkers any have become very familiar in the world of finance in recent weeks. 
" J'entendais a lady at my local supermarket Chinese, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank which went bankrupt, and its lean Director General Dick Toronto, with the same familiarity she might have to criticize a colleague. 
And Lyn, superintendent in uniform of my building, has changed the subject of our regular conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my fruit and vegetable wholesaler. 
She told me, from my visit to the bank. `` I put all my savings in the money market monetary. 
" I changed, I don't want to take a risk ''.

" I photograph the master off the stage to capture elements of its `` Günther Bauer Photographer 
Neither heels, no clothes of étrenne. 
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free of all tension to get the look relaxed of the person. 
On one side of the artist. 
For another, the person. 
Inséparables except in the privacy in these moments unknown of the general public, which found to actions intimate and of sight stolen of artists who did not care to perform on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer mixture in `` Flamenco-people '' the théâtralité some available on the stage with singers, dancers and guitaristes with this side less known artists. 
In this project, the photographer took over the iconography particular flamenco different angles. 
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flemish photography, the exhibition `` reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater each day ', '' says the creator, which clarifies that '' (t) Flamenco-people '' " can be anyone but after seeing the photos, he realizes that not of images typical of artists on stage. 
These individuals photographed " the streets " are artists able to convey on stage of the passion, the sadness, happiness ... captivating the audience. 
To capture of personality moments of these artists should not be of photos on stage. 
They have a personality and a unique character. 
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere which would allow me to capture with the camera of personality moments of the stars of flamenco ". 
With the festival " Chant popular Mines ", Bauer began in 1997 a long trip to photograph the singers, guitaristes or the dancers with a camera to plate. 
These are portraits, which, through choice of camera and equipment, back the classic photography. 
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the classical side of the image, giving a hint of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco by Bauer: One music with roots very traditional evolving and surprising Europe. 
It is not dance or song in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captive audience with his art. 
The search for the essential and magic has been the constant in this work that it has these days it to the gallery El Fotómata.

The titles of his dances drew me into thinking flamenco.

America please least without Paul Newman 
" Sometimes God creates people perfect 
Paul Newman was part. '' 
This is a quote from the actress Sally Field, who served with him in `` No malice ", and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world. 
He found it difficult to get an Oscar 
It was only firing more in 2007. 
Everyone knows it was ill. 
This has been a blow to everyone. 
" Sometimes what one feels exceeds any term, and now I have lost a great friend ', began crying Robert Redford, `` my life and my country was better with its existence ''. 
Nobody was scared of going to ridicule or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of the film and homeland died during an exceptionally dark, where terrorists and stock markets are scared by the esteem of U.S. is at its worst, in desperate grounds of dignity. 
When times are so hard and no reason to live, we can do to humans that the admiration and you don't have to be Luis Cernuda for love Paul Newman. 
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the champion of lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the drug battle created in honor of the eldest son died following an overdose, and the creation of its own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that had of sentence to be imposed against a culture suicidal food. 
This expansive wave of admiration sweep Hollywood without be careful not to nationalities or passport. 
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, has found that none James Bond, died before him. 
Another Englishman, oscarisé Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
" It has set the bar high '' found, George Clooney, who is perhaps the only now trying to pierce the screen, as did Paul Newman: in being very honnêt and with a privacy serious and away goals. 
This is still not easy or possible in the jungle media today. 
But there is the one that tries, and Paul Newman as an example. 
After a divorce, he has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who have been loyal even if the opportunities it were to not be. 
" But why should I eat a burger out of my home, that I have a steak in my fridge? , '' he used to joke. 
In the sky, he attends with pride at the meeting of his daughters with her fans on earth, something that is not customary in America. 
" Of all the broad roles that he interpreted, it has never been so proud that the husband committed, father's love, grandfather's thoughtful and philanthropist ", saying it. 
Madrid in the race to host the Olympic Games of 2016 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid will host the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, this can happen in 2016. 
But I wonder whether we are prepared. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday that they are not! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst rush that I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be subject to note sous l'eau third quarter. 
But is examined in detail and from the beginning. 
Errors start with the withdrawal of dossards, which t'oblige to go in advance. 
This is not easy, but if they make you move that would be better if they give you everything (including the microchip for racing) . 
Not so 
They were te go only to the security vest (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) of surprise, there were only the size ' S ' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
Where are we? 
Will he due to the crisis they have decided to buy that of other small size with less of tissue and thus the cheapest? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of racing. 
Apart from the fact that we must proceed very early to remove the chip, the queue is 15 minutes of trading, and it should be left his backpack at the entrance. 
The debate has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected to these races. 
Since there was a long queue, the competition started and we were not allowed our backpack at the entrance, although once, the withdrawal was worse. 
Also, the rain has accompanied waiting for more than 40 minutes during which took place of rebellions and of assault of barrack. 
I believe that about 500 people will be tomorrow pneumonia and some people like me, do figurerons not even in the classification with the exact time, due to the chip they gave me, which I think was not properly from the start. 
Of course, if they asked me to mention an example of a perfect race, I would particularly not to the idea. 
So I believe that we can always dream of becoming the host city for the Olympic Games. 2016. 
Microsoft seeks a Receptionist (virtual) 
A conference on the Technologies Émergentes MIT Microsoft was introduced a new system for image recognition and of human interaction -- a kind of Intelligence Artificielle with some wit but can perform some basic tasks, like to call a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the campus of the company) in response to what was asked in a conversation. 
With a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and guises, this `` receptionist " knows how many people there in the place, which they are-including remember what positions they occupy, and ears and hear the keywords of their conversations. 
But also grouped according of conversation groups 
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person but they understand that it is not for the group that is speaking with her and is not part of the company. 
She asks whether it is here to visit someone and she told him she will respond in a moment. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which to focus, for instance, on the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has been brought in more than a change in strategy in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more streamlined and it no longer as many programs associated. 
Steve Ballmer has found that the computers were sold with the need instead of unnecessary applications, they went five times faster. 
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped added functions and `` extras " to Windows. 
The strategy shift is welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operational system loses of dimension but also its software. 
When Google Chrome happened on the network, I was one of those who signed up to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that a Internet browser does not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary because this is the essential basis for the hardware and the software are included. 
It serves the same function your wife or your husband with when you to say something to your mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It will never be closed, but it remains to be seen in the ' the death ' operating system not as an absolute truth but as a truth about. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are less and less attention to the operational system but increasingly in Internet browser. 
The switch the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than to go windows. 
A who serve half of the applications filed with the système ? 
Who can do more can do less. 
And Windows 7 will need to contain less of applications, much less than Vista. 
Under heavy, crowded month, less complex. 
For the time being, Microsoft is interested in the launch of its own services on-line for they are finally an alternative to Google. 
They are in desperate need of it, in fact, and I am showing you an example. 
The photo within this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asked to use their own research tool-`` Ta research. Our Future ''. 
In 2006, a study found that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to search for information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile. 
It will not in early 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010 
Microsoft will surely launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile. 
The telephone, after all, is increasingly a computer. 
But the launch Android being late with the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on the Côte d' Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in had a in the ` Blood Diamond ' Edward Zwick, along with Al Pacino in ` The Sponsor ' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the association of gays heavy-handed. 
And if we are to list all his appearances could also quote this costaud moustachu that raised weight in a traveling circus. 
It is not just a jersey male body in cotton, grinding and sleeveless. 
The English's called 'tank' but the Fabuleux Brussels Marcel stands out among all others. 
Firstly, by name and said-although this is known as ` Marcel '-which has to do with sport as it takes the name, according to tradition, boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf. 
The ' Marcel '' distinguishes itself by its excellent cotton, by its rule single-sex, with its distinctive logo and the little Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the singlets best known have in the neck. 
But be careful, because the Belgian mark does not only that of tank tops. 
But it also produces sweat-shirt, boxers retro, cardigans in cashmere pants in cotton, of babies, of mini-shorts. .. 
A dress designed for the comfort of underwear. 
Even though it is unfortunate to wear only as underwear. 
They have too much of charm. 
" I want to become a young mother; the candidate does worry me '' 
Its enormous affinity with her sister has not prevented to develop its own personality.

Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress. 
The dancers love well dressing for courses and tests, for looking in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the actress role, when you endosses the clothes it is at that point you put really in the skin of the character. 
Suddenly, everything is linked.

The biological clock doesn't be afraid. 
I did all the things I wanted to do for a very small and gave me a lot of inner happiness. 
So, think you become maman ? 
Of course, I want to become mom because my body wonder, and I want to become a young mother, I don't want to lose that. 
As regards the candidate, I am not worried. 
What I will do is to give a lot of happiness to my son and raise them with a lot of love. 
The movie, you waiting for the various films that you have it turned the last year out. 
It is true, I'm looking forward to that they come out.

Multiple offenders of drink-driving will install a system 'alcolock' 
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver that took more than three administrative punishments for alcohol, has to be installed on the vehicle a system that prevents propel the vehicle by drunk, or if he does not blow. 
The initiative was already announced in June and she now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered to be a pilot project is one year. 
Its goal is the rehabilitation of driver by providing remedial courses road. 
The Minister of State responsible for road safety but also the Directorate-General Safety Routière and the Foundation Technological Institute for Security the car will participate in this endeavor. 
According to the statistics, 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having done more than once by drunk, '' says the car. 
The alcolock avoid it because it is a wired system on the vehicle which measures the percentage of alcohol in the breath and failing to start the car if the driver does not blow then; or when the rate of alcohol drive's exceed the ceiling. 
The cost is greater than 1,000 euros and is dependent on the driver. 
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences during the first year of deployment. 
And in Spain is estimated it could save the lives to 115 people each year. 
This is for administrative sanctions for two reasons: deal with these behaviors before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by normal channels, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form commercial, although some industrial vehicles and in already has a to Experimental smoker. 
Specifically, tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist party which proposes to install in school buses this system as has happened in France.

There is no than 1,000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the relentless daily life. 
And to cap it all, they are listed in a book that will of relax to booksellers September 30. 
The alarm clock saddens us almost when it rings each morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse if you consider the pace restless that imposes on us the current lives. 
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer of back pain. 
Stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there is no one or two methods to combat the daily fatigue and the problems linked to the world of work. 
But many 1001, or more and to a less. 
Apart from the positions of yoga, massage classic or the treatment 'spa', Susannah Marriott meeting in the pages of a book and a 'menu' of methods suited to taste and everyone time.

Moreover, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or revenues 100% natural that help to relax. 
If the adrenalin did not run through your veins to restore the balance of your body and the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, of disconnected from his mind and focus on reading. 
Speaking in sleeping 
Some children speak during the night. 
I referred not to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who speak in their sleep. 
The first time that to happen it may surprise you, but in fact this is not relevant. 
This is a minor alteration of sleep called somniloquie. 
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents. 
Of course, there is more than one who speaks during the night. 
This may appear quite sporadic (once in life example associated with an episode of high fever, or more consistent (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) , the day after the child does not remember anything more. 
There is no single cause of which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other alterations of sleep as nightmares, the terrors night, énurésies night (be pipi in bed or the sleepwalking, but it is not always the case. 
As I said before, it can also be associated with a very high fever, to situations of stress or agitated. 
Either way it is a little-studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which there is is also highly variable. 
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, of sound or in contrast with cries, of cry, of long speeches. .. 
Where the somniloquie becoming very common, it is good to see the child and to see a specialist, to see if there is a problem causing a great deal of anxiety and for an explanation to this problem. 
We have said that this is a minor alteration, therefore there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep which can be careful (for example, if it is linked to sleep apnea or stress) . 
What we can do is to take into account a number of preventive measures very simple such as: 
Try not to excite the child before they go to sleep. 
Therefore seek of games alone and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and having trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside. 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
Once the somniloquies are trying to stay calm. 
Remember that they are harmless to the child and the next day he does remember most of what happened. 
Tips 
Please wake up. 
It is meaningless because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
While he talked, he sleeps and therefore assumes. 
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a physician or to investigate what caused so many childhood anxiety. 
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual, have not been the temptation to ask for information. 
You get nothing, because, in the frame, it is not aware to arrange his thinking. 
In addition, you hear what he says, but you don't know what it is in the process of dream, a show of be careful how you interpréterez information and to the conclusions you draw from this. 
Never say to the child that you look at night knowing these secrets. 
Even not jokingly. 
That causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, don't worry, this does not much bad, it is an episode which lasted only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern. .. finally 
Illhaeusern has finally found the path to victory on his land after a long period of food shortages. 
Without a big game, Yellow and blacks have grown up the largest number of occasions and succeeded in turning a for the gain of the match.

But Dannemarie will not benefited and will not pose a huge problem to a Eleven illhousien who has just fallen somewhat for '' clump " his defense, except in the final seconds of the game when, after a big cafouillage, the ball was very close to the cross-sectional.

" It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
She is good instincts ", has however warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagénaire McCain has repeatedly putting forward its undisputed experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing in the ' naivety " of his opponent on the issues that were at the heart of the first face-to-face. 
" The Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ... '' he accused several times.

A Minsk, `` you have noticed that there was an election, you? '' 
Young and opponents had Sunday night on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject, in advance the outcome of legislative. 
A few hundred of the Belarusian people came together on Sunday night at the close of polls in the central square in Minsk to protest a fraudulent nature of legislative. 
While no results had yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko as `` the dictator, resignation ". 
Some admit there not even voted follows: '' What good as they do what they want my vote. '' said a young. 
They do not believe that the plan that has been successful to foreign observers to resume talks with the European Union is ready to move in a new direction. Democratic 
The sanctions, including a ban on visas for 40 the Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, may be lifted if the elections were considered to own the observers. 
They were not under the opposition. 
" We have been left out of the electoral commissions and our observers were not attend at the recount ", regretted Iouri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous collection of twelve parties. 
" This is a cosmetic change, says Mr Alexander Milinkevich, former opposition candidate for the presidential 2006 and leader of the pro-European, because the important thing is that counts the votes, and here is the executive.

If our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and that we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be Independent 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the election process would recognize the validity of the vote.

The interview-From the returned blood sure 
Hema-Quebec yesterday was the 10th anniversary of its founding and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to be pleased, because HQ has become one of the blood suppliers most safe and effective world. 
Most importantly, he has regained the public trust that has been seriously eroded by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As is well known, the national reserves of blood managed by the Transfusion Service of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s. 
Faced with this tragedy and grumbles from the public, the Government of Canada introduced in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Mr. Justice Horace Krever Inquiry which was to investigate the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster again. 
While the Justice Krever slow to release its report, some provinces have established a committee to plan a new management system of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the Committee Gélineau has accomplished this. 
Following report Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: HQ to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and two territories. 
" In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was daunting. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and the fieldwork during the years, we have regained the trust of the public, '' she said before say proudly that at the start of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had now confidence in HQ. 
She Décary custody however in mind that `` confidence is extremely precarious ". 
From its inception, September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has implemented the precautionary principle. 
At that time, there was in Europe to the outbreak many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says that taking the strong since its foundation in 1998. 
" And we don't know of any if the disease could be transmitted through blood. 
It was built on a key recommendation of reports Krever and Gélineau that when you do not know, and that a serious disease might be found in, in this case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, it is introducing measures exclusion. 
In April 1999, it was therefore denied the blood of people who had stayed more than a month in the UK since 1980. 
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood. 
The episode we showed, as the precautionary principle which has been applied made sense. '' 
In 1999 appeared on the market a much more sensitive technique of HIV testing: testing of nucleic acid (NAT) that detect directly into the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that antibodies against the virus, underpinning the tests used previously. 
NAT assays have helped to shorten the period silent, stretching between the time a person is infected and the first virus can be detected in the blood by our technical, explains the specialist. 
It was able to reduce this period to less than a week. 
It has declined substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and they can detect. 
These improvements have allowed to significantly lower the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million at risk of getting HIV contaminated blood. 
" In other words, this means that we must dispense 12 million blood products before someone being infected with HIV. 
As Hema-Quebec distributed each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before that occurs a case of HIV transmission through a blood product. 
I believe that we can now feel comfortable to receive or require a blood transfusion to recover the health '', says the chief executive of Hema Quebec. 
" Our challenge for the coming decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never know what pathogen emerges in the system. 
No later than last year has appeared on the island of Réunion the chikungunya virus which, as in the case of West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant ", said Dr Décary then noted that in addition to a safe supply, HQ should also provide an adequate supply. 
" The needs are increasing because the population is aging. 
The cancer treatments being more aggressive, the patients frequently need to recharge in red blood cells or in chips. 
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who only includes an average of 3% of Quebecers eligible for donating blood. '' 
Everyone in the health, 18 years and older meeting these eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times per year. 
On average, 14% of those offering their blood are not acceptable, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and have traveled in a country with malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year. 
" With this 3% , we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
Shortages are extremely rare. 
But we must renew members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to give of their blood, but above all to retain and attract them to become regular donors. 
The life of today is so rampant, rarely found time to spend an hour to give blood ', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for severe burns. 
These tissues were analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in HQ who manages the only public bank of cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once considered a waste biomedical full of a blood is rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia. 
" It was celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our sample thousandth of cord blood and is expected to take more than a thousand per year. 
It should begin to move, for transplants at the beginning of the year next ``, said Dr. Décary that describes the collection program of cord blood as popular. 
" Several moms are disappointed not be able to access '' because HQ did not have the resources to offer this program complex and costly in all hospitals in Quebec. 
Soccer-The Impact in the semi-finals 
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the round semi-finals playoff tournament of the first division of the USL, with a victory 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Sounders of Seattle yesterday, at the second and decisive match of the series quarter-finals in total goals, Stadium in Saputo.

He has had a successful standing ovation. '' 
Charest put on the North 
The Prime Minister does not call an election before the end of the year 
Once the General Council of the Liberal Party over, Jean Charest went yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, and the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) tries to get elected to the by-election today. 
" Pushing the limits of our last major northern border ": that is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has submitted with visual force within the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin à Image. 
Tournaient loop, on three huge screens, of spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by `` Google Maps ", maps, etc. 
Considerable resources as an election period. 
In press point, of course, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that there triggered the elections this fall, although he noted that his schedule had been quite intense. 
The `` Plan North '' is the fourth part of a ` vision ' for the Prime Minister's claims to have for Quebec, one for an `` new space economic, '' which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario. 
Often referred speeches by the Prime Minister recently, the opening North-the northern territory in the 49th parallel had never done a submission. 
The Prime Minister has since resorted to explain why the North was `` a jewel with immense potential ", but has not given its due, investment figures, and priorities for specific in future projects. 
At the most a few options which could be further developed. including hydro, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North included therein ' nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds ", according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This `` territory twice as big as France '', `` This is our home, it is in Quebec. 
Not only here, but it was us, '' he insisted, like to make it clear that seeking a founding myth National. 
The Quebec is much built in its relations with the North, he said. the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the James Bay. 
" It is our future, '' he added, after a dramatic pause to contemplate the great card behind him. 
The North, 70% in Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press conference. 
" It's a traditional position that all governments have re-emphasized. 
There is a boundary line on which there is no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the Government '', he said. 
Then again, '' with climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North '', he said in talks's Northwest Passage, which will open all year because of melting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec could be very careful about them and that the project would, especially for young people. 
Two former ministers from both parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP deputy from the Parti québecois Ungava) have already started consultations with than 30 communities. 
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place started work. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, `` not necessarily a Summit '', but a time when ` we will a vision common '. 
The development North would from elsewhere in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The Plan North `` will be collaborative, ordered and respectful of the environment, '' he promised. 
Jean Charest has described this ` vision ' as being in line with those of prime minister liberal predecessors. 
" As the liberals who came before us, we thought otherwise to turn challenges into opportunities for growth and development. '' 
This has been a constant theme of this weekend, which began Friday by a large cocktail to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage the 2004 election 
One of resolutions proposing to rename the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout. 
" In Godbout, who created Hydro-Qu ébec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of power, to Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party has been forging the future, '' said Jean Charest. 
In press point, he invoked a further reference, conservative these, the program ` Roads to the North '' of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the hydro-electric dam project of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest pointed out that its operation was scheduled for 2012. 
" It rest of us here, but I plan to be '' he said to its activists, sparking home applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there will be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of triggering an election this fall, what the law permits. 
It underlined that its schedule is however completed, including by a mission of the federation in China and a high Québec-New York. 
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader a platform with nationalist resolutions, including `` the aspirations constitutional ' which rose as a letter in the mail: the PLQ called in particular the recognition of `` specificity du Québec '' in the Constitution. 
It would also like that the Québec appoints members of the Board of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the part of the opposition, it was welcomed the outline of the Plan North with skepticism. 
The chief deputy from the Parti québecois, Pauline Marois, has pioneered the development policy Northern Quebec that the government Landry was launched in 2001. 
In its view, the Liberal government, in coming to power in 2003, withdrew the application. 
Had he done so, `` there would be more advanced we see today '' said Ms. Marois alongside their candidate in Jean-Talon (poll held today) , Françoise Mercury. 
The ADQ supported the adoption of a Plan North by the government. 
" But what we would like is that it was not just a spectacle '', said leader Sébastien Proulx, to replace Mario Dumont, who returns from holiday today. 
Letters A Country disgrace 
It is Mr Vic Toews, Minister of `` Justice '' ô irony) in the office of Harper, who was last summer say of Louise Arbour she was a `` disgrace '' for Canada. 
Discard and shame on this woman who conducted a unending struggle for justice and which deserves our admiration in also says a lot about the entourage of Prime Minister that on Stephen Harper himself. 
We discovered a government that is the only -- of all Western countries involved, to have not repatriated its citizens caught up in the concentration camp at Guantánamo. 
A government which takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young man teenager at the time of the case against him. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies his floor and lets in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice for assessing the guilt of the accused. 
But, for the record, as UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, including, pleading for the return of Omar Khadr so that he has a fair trial in Canada. 
It is the same government that condone torture: little him what if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably never after so many years of violence. 
You don't see them yet but we are in the midst of a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our `` democracy '' that word that Harper constantly brandishing and which sounds so hollow in his mouth. 
This is the moment when no morality is no longer there: this could abuse, torture, arbitrary trap a Canadian citizen under the sake of a head of state so far minority (qu'en Will therefore after October 14. 
Number of voters believe they'll find salvation in a which extols the Vertu, the Act and the Order: they do not see that this government has decided not to making the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is here, in this cessation, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion-Speech Orwellian of Barrick Gold 
In its issue of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold. 
Along a logical Orwellian, he says the major company world gold has sued for defamation six million against three authors and a small publishing house penniless, to initiate a `` public debate transparent ''. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, that is not the truth that they feel, especially in the case of legal proceedings for defamation, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely overshadowed by Mr. Garver. 
For, Barrick Gold, the best way of conducting a public debate would it be to lead to ruin anyone dares to support a position contrary to his? 
Whatever the outcome of the trial, authors and the editor of the Book Black Canada will spend a lot of money to prepare their defense and fight, to weapons very uneven, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets virtually without substance of the mining. 
The tactic, in this struggle uneven, is often wrecking the defendants to impose an out-of-court settlement that bâillonnera the opposition in addition to scare anyone dare to take up the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate of is the public opinion she should have presented his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is happening in a number of countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally by the exchange of ideas and not to baton beatings. 
It was enough to the mining to open its books, records and establishing a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to authors of Black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr. Garver could he explain how it could both request the discussion `` the public any disregard for the views of the public? 
In the world of Vice President, it seems that this expression refers only the lawyers highly paid and not all Canadians; and are a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak. 
But that does not or will not understand-Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the writers and editors of Black Canada primarily because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining. 
The public is willing to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, rather than in what many see as a poursuite-bâillon (pursuing the debate public, '' Barrick Gold have to file a notice to the place of black authors Canada told discontinue the use of this term. 
Beyond's speech surreal of Mr. Garver, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct assault on freedom of university research and the quest for truth, key to any democratic society. 
She denies outright, the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpretations, which are at the very foundation of knowledge work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like to rich companies of this world into a country like Canada, face prosecution to repeat, which can do? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada. 
She has a right of reply. 
The academic community, which we belong, long known to run debates and disagreements and conflict. 
The continuation of the excessive Barrick Gold makes clear that, contrary to what it claims, she has no desire debated in a transparent. 
That is a loss for the academic community and for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to implement of limiting devices of this kind of unjustified proceedings. 
The rescue of Wall Street-Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan $700 billion U.S. to the financial crisis rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress. 
This provides greater control by the elected for the purposes of implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to keep down the number of homes seized for failure to pay, as well as a look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight last night, at the end of a marathon of negotiations two days. 
" We've made great strides toward an agreement which will be effective in the marketplace '', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
" Every attempt has been made to the shelter the real economy and Americans ordinary of the ongoing crisis in Wall Street '', said the Democrat. 
" This is the fundamental point that if we do not do that, the trauma, the chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be immense ", said the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had revolved to sprint in the final hours of fear that would another failure on investor sentiment. 
The time limit that were given was the opening up of markets this morning. 
Associates late to the negotiations, both candidates in the US presidential election were generally favourable to the agreement, without fail, however, to express discontent that you need to get to this end. 
The Democrat Senator Obama has made the addition of some provisions in the agreement, such as the one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes and that the pay of corporate CEOs rescapées by the state. 
" When asked to taxpayers take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not much to be pleased about. 
But these measures are necessary '', he commented on the airwaves of American television. 
Questioned on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, has said: `` I want to see the details, I hope so. '' 
" The broad lines that I have read (show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable '', he said. 
The plan of 700 billion aims to buying up (with taxpayers ' money doubtful debts, assets at risk and unsaleable of U.S. financial institutions. 
Sometimes after 14 months of a crisis that began with the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of the sub-prime (subprime) prior to spread to other more common forms of credit securities (AFCP) and lead to a liquidity freeze and on the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a grouping of elected Republicans that wrecked the first draft agreement, last week. 
It be out of this impasse since the Democrats have agreed that some assets '' toxic " of companies in difficulty are provided by the government, rather than purchased. 
To of around the edges for everyone in Congress, it was also added a provision that if the government were to take on losses for five years with the program, it could put in place of new taxes designed to help back. 
The new plan provides for the payment of first $250 billion to which can be added another 100 billion if the President considers necessary. 
The payment to 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote in Congress. 
In return for his help, Washington will obtain holdings in companies rescued that it worth of dividends in the event of profit and can sell when the turmoil will last. 
The federal government has the option of delaying the entry procedures for housing attached to mortgages concerned by this plan, and for limits to compensation and severance payments to executives of companies involved. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to a vote in the House of Representatives today, and that of the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite their efforts, it is still uncertain whether their plan will the go-ahead. 
Calls have continued to rise yesterday against the project, both in the Republican camp Democrat. 
" Clearly, Washington do you will not '', said at the address of the voters the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Committee on Finance of the House. 
" Yes, we have a serious financial problems. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of taxpayers '. 
Facilitator a small group in Congress nicknamed " the caucus of sceptical '', the representative Democrat Brad Sherman this differently, but came to the same conclusion. 
" Four hundred eminent scholars of economy, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us saying asked Congress not to press and take a close look at the path to take, '' he said yesterday. 
Meanwhile, in Europe, there was once again the evidence of the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux-countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US) . 
The intervention of governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not proceed with acquire its rival in trouble since that she lost $2 billion euros ($ 2.9 billion US) in the crisis of mortgages at risk in the United States. 
Fortis employ 85,000 people and is one of the 21 major European banks and of the top 10 insurers. 
" This is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, they get the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
Precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that times are planned uncertain. '' 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government appeared poised to nationalize another bank bullied by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government resume to his account of all loans outstanding in the bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than $41 billion ($ 75.5 billion US) of mortgages. 
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it is buying the branches and customer accounts of British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would the second bank, after the Northern Rock, which the British government should nationalise since the start of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008)-Death of an icon committed 
Her beauty with azure eyes was long its asset map, some people may say its weakness. 
When it was liberated from mirror narcissistic, the American actor in smile charmeur? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent plunging of source the will also away from power registry who actually giving rise the real sacred monsters. 
But large bottom runner! 
Paul Newman, died Friday, at 83 years, from lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema good years. 
Less monumental that Brandon, to whom he resembled and which he was long a rival way to screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more vulnerable, but apostle also of freedom and the collapse of conventions of drama. 
The blood involved are often beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots will generate a of faces glorious American dream. 
Without disproportionate ego, ultimate stamp of quality. 
For in him projeta a whole country enamored of self made man, veteran of the war in the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumph to the theater, television, soon in theaters. 
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the pilot automotive classa second to 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubles as a sex symbol, although a member of a couple formed model since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Disparaissent also with him the gray areas of this secretive star, low-key, committed, allergic to splinters of show business, which will not entirely cracked the mystery. 
An honest man in the best sense of the word. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman gave the vertigo fans this weekend, while collide key roles on the black screen memories. 
More than half a century of a seventh American art changing marches through it. 
Come to compete in memory the charm cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969, the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Chatte on a rooftop hot adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us, we hear his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promise. 
So many other Paul Newman moved to the history. 
The boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marqué by hate) Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, who started really Newman in 1956. 
This malfrat appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (L'Arnaque) Oscar for best film in 1973. 
A of pool bitter and vengeful in the magnificent The Hustler Robert Rossen, 1961, it will resume the character on the back in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who won him in 1987's sole Oscar out of nine nominations. 
In 1993 through the ages, it was him. 
Once him. 
The times are running through its journey. 
Young people are particularly across the cultissime Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of hockey unorthodox. 
His fans were found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen. 
With a last role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was completed. 
Unlike several movie legends who lâchèrent soon enough loom, Newman will remained long saddle, denouncing Hollywood, its C, its good and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier the seen, not without humor, '' as a living challenge to `` l'underplaying " saying her benefits too supported. 
The profession has not always been kind to the lovely Paul Newman to which roles fell long all cooked in the beak. 
He played less often young first that the marginal. névrosés, alcoholic, swines or desperate, whose traits perfect reflétèrent excesses and revolts. 
As director, Newman became of poorly understood facets of its true sensitivity pudique. 
His Rachel, Rachel '' in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence, with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, outlined an end female portrait of melancholy. 
He who lost his son Scott by overdose him dédia his film Harry and Son in 1984, out of modesty and sad. 
Among the tributes rain that déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, saddened follows: '' His presence has made my life and this country better. '' 
Générosité, love of life are all features of vibrating actor's disappeared. 
Over his career of legend, is obliterated also a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, the independent film, a protest abuses of Hollywood. 
There has been much its binette trôner on jars of dressing, sauces, cookies and other products, saying the process of very bad taste, although joke. 
The profits to those sales were still paid to his Foundation for children at risk. 
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, has committed to the end. 
He has left his five girls a letter containing these sentences follows: '' In the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good fortune. 
It was a privilege to be here. '' 
And a privilege for us to have followed the story of an American artist if lucid and so generous. 
A model, in short and additional. 
That could make Zuschlag& Company in their plant at bills? 
Shortly, October 8, will start the proceedings relating to the criminal proceedings underway, from János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud in the form of criminal organization, a permanent and regular, it has resulted of particularly significant damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as false and fraudulent use. 
According to the floor, the money from grants, was spent for personal, while benefits were justified by fictitious invoices. 
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, was a share in the coffers of movement Fiatal Baloldal and other, in the pocket of some people. 
The method, published also by the investigating authority, was to receive the money grants received by issuing costs invoices, behind which no actual delivery was provided and associations breach ever their commitments. 
According to the indictment, much of invoices were untrue. 
For these, they picked of invoices notebooks market Józsefváros, while they manufactured the fees to Kiskunhalas. 
For names of companies that would appear on the invoice, it was decided, inter alia, during tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, made by István Lados, upon request of János Zuschlag. 
According to the testimony, it would identify pension and restaurants. 
For his personal drinks, he called for an invoice in the style to which they had other bills they would introduce, among others, with the Ministry of Youth and Sport, Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of Capital to subsidies. 
The majority of invoices was created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, which according to our information, was especially of drafting the necessary records to obtain grants. 
At a `` tracking circuit ", one of the choices Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two invoices in Zuschlag in 2003, this place assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, based on the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people have this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice made out in the name of the foundation Jobb Jövőért, which subsequently will the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, grouillait of forms mistakes and of substance. 
A pension, based in Badacsonytomaj, did in fact that three bedrooms, and maximum 10 people were the night. Yet, the invoice indicated 130 clients. 
Issuers of invoices to the exceptionally creative have also fallen in the excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal -LCB-, owned also in the Horeca sector. In their accounts, or the name of Jobb Jövőért or of the Hoppá not appear, according to the information given to the floor. 
Győző Farkas, a manager of the company, told the site hvg. hu when the pen the convened and showed him the bills, he is, immediately, that it was false documents. 
" The name of our society and our tax number were placed at the wrong place on the cachet. '' 
He added: ` In addition to the form, the fact that from the invoice, 100 people were housed there, not in keeping not, since this institution has only 11 rooms, which are not as much part of. 
In addition, the bill also noted, meals and our restaurant was closed long ago. '' 
Issuers of zealous invoices were not knowledgeable about travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising travel abroad, so naively, they indicated of stay in Hungary on bills to settle in cash which will also be against the accounting practices of the Agency. 
Moreover, as we have seen in the investigation, added also VAT on these documents, while the benefits about travel activities, whose destination is outside the EU, are charged without VAT. 
Similarly, the VAT rate of four invoices issued on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp's order to Jobb Jövőért were incorrect, since benefits of society can not tolerate a VAT of 25% , as suggested, but a VAT of 15% . In addition, employees in the hotel only emit of printed bills, while the false were hand written) . 
The pen investigation reveals that the `` issuers " have also made mistakes stating provision for the carriage of goods by road, that the issuing corporation of invoices could not exercise because its profile was the investment advice. 
Moreover, it is also for vices, as types of invoices inadequate and false fees, that the invoices issued the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont turned out to be false. 
Just as for the company Ravenna Bt. or of internship sport Kunfehértó, who both deny being their authors of invoices issued in their name. 
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that society HIB -LCB-. , based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies issued the invoice. 
Invoices set deliberately 
Another category of issuer of the bills are similar composed of those who were fully aware of what they were requested to issue fictitious invoices. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal Ifjú Szocialisták, created a receipt to the order of the foundation Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, for an amount of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Record-radio -LCB-. was driven to issuing false invoices by one of the accused, Neil Györfi. 
Similarly, cooperated with Zuschlags, the company Biogate -LCB-. , who is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, was issued invoices to the order of the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, of the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, amounting to approximately five million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided. 
No financial transaction did not happen, because that invoices were canceled at the end, but it, organizations have avoided to mention it in their records. 
The following category of issuers of invoices is that of companies directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the Deputy Executive Director General of society Delta Trió -LCB-. , who trade for fuel and vehicles, whose registered office was in Budapest, but that was unsuccessful, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, the firm has issued multiple invoices for the sale of computer hardware, to the tune of nearly $18 million HUF. 
According to the survey, such equipment would have been purchased by the corporation Cash Investment -LCB-. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005. 
The director of that corporation was a man of Romanian origin, to which Iván Kubatov would also sent documents in the company, between 2002 and 2005. 
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that it issued invoices to the order of companies Atlasz, Hoppá and of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and has pocketed equivalent. 
Precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that of masons Romanian created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari -LCB-. and Jos-Investment Bt. 
In reality, none of these companies operate, what the accused explained by the fact that they were not working. 
He used still these collectives, as to the application of Petty Officer Zsolt Szente, co-accused and draftsman of acts of foundation of societies, it submitted invoices to their names, out to associations relating to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov has given to organizations, 15 bills in total, issued by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of $14.2 million HUF. 
The Office believed that 10% of the amount shown on the invoices, and VAT were in the pocket of Kubatov. 
He has even used the corporation Szi-Beri Bt. to create fictitious invoices that have been used in the context of the application of Biztos Bridge. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért have applied for a grant to the organization of public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA) . 
They found that this subsidy for an amount of twice 500,000 HUF, but they have not been used for the purposes of the application. 
To ensure that this does not come out, five fictitious invoices received from the corporation Works Team -LCB-. was presented at the TMA. 
Indeed, it is those bills that were reached at the raid in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, some of accused relatera method of manufacture of invoices, as it did back to the floor above. 
That could be really interesting is that the accused master, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story. 
So far, confession are not very detailed, and even though he has promised to repeatedly tell the last detail, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement whereby in exchange for repayment of much of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only the hat. 
Today, it's probably upset, as applications for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of relief from his conditions of detention, are continually on deaf ears. 
While those who have caused far greater damage, and the perpetrators of economic crimes non-repairable, roam freely or at least expect in their own homes the end of the procedure. He does not have that power. 
The psychology of one-upmanship: Why spend it more money? 
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the good. 
Researchers in Neurology and economics from the University of New York has managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this famous and apparently irrational behavior. 
The result of their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be behind in these competitions, such as an auction on eBay, which is why they prefer to pay too high a price. 
These studies attempted to provide a neurological scheme of this kind of `` game '' with sales experimental auctions. 
The groups of volunteers played in lottery, while the other group was involved in an auction entertainment, while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) , researchers analyzed the brain areas of birds. 
In the two games, participants could earn money, but during the auction which is an essential component of the overkill of a third party, all located in the brainstem, called striatum, was being intensive way movement of the loss of the party. 
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of `` auto-stimulation " nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices explicable with the flight to the violent reaction striatum. 
In support of their theory, economists members of this group of researchers continued analysis of financial supervision. 
At these three groups surenchérissaient faced with a partner in various circumstances. 
They simply informed the control group of the actual product in question, as well as they have made their. 
A another group, they promised that if, in addition, they went out a winner of the game then they would receive $15 extra reward. 
As the third group has received these $15 prior to the auction, but the group lost also that money, in case they lose the auction. 
The difference between them is in fact that the focus was in one on the victory, while in the other, on the failure. 
By proving the assumption of neurologists, the team of actors '' against the failure ' were willing to lay greater than those made by the control group and the group '' for victory ". 
" These results could not be demonstrated by any economic theory existing one. 
Indeed, each of them it was the phenomena occurring at auctions by the pleasure of winning, the parade at the risk. 
Only imaging methods neurological helped remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading, now, on a third explanation. ''-found Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Department of Economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when are we to see a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death. 
An estimated 200 000 people with the disease carry the virus for hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles treatment. This is's in fact that often the patients are not aware that they are carrying the virus. 
The name Hepatitis is a generic name given to of infections affecting the liver and caused by different virus. 
There are a lot of similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristics, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from one another. 
The hepatitis viruses, according to the genes, pathogens spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive system (e.g., food or water contaminated, the hepatitis B, C, D and other blood-borne viruses and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva) . 
For travellers, in any event, it is recommended to be vaccinated against the virus A and B. There is no vaccine for the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, in general, with a poor condition of weakness, for upset stomach and nausea. 
Then grows on the skin and the whites of the eye a visible jaundice, stool become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Recovery may take two to three weeks. 
Around the world, each year, a million die of the most serious form of the disease, like cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The most important reason for this is that an estimated, only a patient about ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences if she is left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most sufferers do is known not reached of the virus, because the gene pathogen destroyed devious liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years. 
Therefore, early prevention is very important, and regularly screened. 
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and the tattooed. 
Currently, it is $200 patients with chronic hepatitis C '' type in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a review of routine laboratory, it is advisable to consult her physician from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be cured if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection removed, and the development of a cancer is warned. 
On 30 September is the Day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representative of patients from around the world. 
Its goal is to call attention to the liver cirrhosis, chronic caused by viruses, on the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone who believes in God feels about less pain? 
Based on the results of a recent research, religious belief that would work as a kind of pain that has already helped to make more bearable martyrs death Catholics. 
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article in which researchers at the University of Oxford have made an interesting experience in analyzing where the belief in God could affect the tolerance to the pain of human beings. 
In the experiment for slightly bizarre, 12 Roman Catholic believers and as many atheists have been subjected to electric shock, while each of them was a painting depicting the Virgin Mary. 
Based on the results, the faithful Catholics were able to rule out much of the pain. 
Thanks to a technique palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians engaged from different areas of the university. 
Specifically, the experience is as follows: an instrument Emitting sparks and distributing electric shock is set on the left hand of experimental subject. 
They asked participants to the experience of watching sustained two paintings, these being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 1600s, and the other Dame to the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci at 15th century. 
Researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a sort of status of faith among believers, while the choice of paint from Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect. 
The birds spent a half-hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, received 20 ECT in four part in office, while watching paint to religious theme, that theme more generally. 
Catholics reported that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as `` security '', as anyone `` takes care " and they are `` quiet, and the peace the has invaded ". 
In the view of the painting of religious, they accounted for 12% in less pain than when watching the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, which itself had participated in the experiment, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image among atheists, subject to find the appropriate photo. 
" We should find an image to which they responded very positively, such as a mother or a father ", said psychologist. 
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research. 
" The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, effectively changes our personality ", said Wright. 
After this excellent performance, there are only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of subjects pain if there is to believers a Madone painted by Leonardo or a painter of the same caliber? 
Is the to a Virgin Mary of better quality would better results? 
You what you disclosed about you 
On the occasion of its 10th anniversary, Google argues that it can be found at the back of people's pockets along with the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their vacations, which experts they visit and what their interests. 
But it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of those who have influence in society. 
While for the skeptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror Orwell, they are not the core of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, a little while ago in the Financial Times that the main ambition Google is to gather more information about its users. This is needed for which the founders of Google may meet their original purpose which meant as follows: '' Recueillons in a system all the information of the world ''. 
According to the head of Google searched, after 10 years of a work of dismantling world, they are still early days of their power to all the information. 
To the question: what actually happens in the next five years? Schmidt answered that Google can answer questions like `` What can I do tomorrow? '' and `` What is the work that I would the best? '' However, the software can not respond to this, simple at first glance, that the day they find out enough about users. 
It is not quite clear to all Internet users that the words used in research on the internet, the IP address of the computer that launches the research and the pages visited then by interested persons are specifically listed. 
Through the program Personalized Search launched two years ago, example, users can store their own history of research and can see what they have sought, on what respondents clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide answers much more intimate, and we will of the goods and services on the basis of our previous statements and of our preferences recorded. 
What happens if someone is using my information against me, if it is watching what is my job? '' asks users, who are concerned seeing the information monopoly of Google. 
In most cases, is power potential represented by the company is likely to cause of fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power which may create for those a negative feedback. 
It is a fact confirmed that the search terms are not only registered but in justified cases, they are sent to a third party, and in such cases legal, nothing protects the privacy rights of Internet users. 
The example most resounding these days is probably the coordinated action against of paedophiles Brazilian, during which Google has transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had gathered on the public page called Orkut, allowing identification. 
The surfers committed human rights have been able to breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, arm confused with the body of legal protection electronic EFF, has proved its own right to the court against the FBI. The after the decision, in the future, Google can not be bound by any points of the constitution to disclose any information about the secret application of the FBI, whatsoever. 
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms he won in tightening of the law on the protection of children, voted several years earlier. But in the end we do not succeed in getting the research lists private users, or the full list of websites and key words of the last two months. ) 
The judgment of Google is quite contradictory: it is criticised by those who fear the transmission of personal data, because they think their inner world and their private sector in suffer when they start to use the services Google, so they're dealing with them in the spirit of revolt that is being shown against the multinational companies that are proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, culture geek U.S. and its '' sauvageons " with the fans, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big business, the `` corporation connected '', as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as world invader due to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal. 
This may be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, not asking its users to identification code, not asking for money for its applications. Code documentary and the programming package, continually refreshed, a much more accessible, younger and more cool, with the giant practice Journal of software. 
The reason may be that the geeks are exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and Internet, and the Web 2.0, the key word in the most proclaimed of recent years, from just behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 does not relate something different to the collaboration, that the fact that we leave traces intent behind us, and that we use of communication channels available to us, and during that the dimension of these changes one by one, the bottom line is unchanged -- we are exposed. 
A young, in general, may maintain a profile on several pages of public Facebook to Xanga, and could even connect it with other benefits, such as at Twinter, or last. fm, listing its musical patterns. They then link them to a tracking system, as FriendFeed or Blip. fm. They can also keep blogging, in which appear automatically their most recent photo galleries they stock on Flickr or on Picasa. 
As can be seen many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who understandably in view of the morning photos, taken by the circle of friends common, with which his friend unfaithful spent the evening, or that of the company laid off to an employee, just to the sincere opinion that he wrote on his blog about top management, there may be on a term of privacy is totally to reconsider these days. 
Those who live a life online, consists of what it shows itself, and that it is the right way to define the principle behind the behavior of youth today. 
Anyone trying to hide something, or at least attempting to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do this (, beginning for example with Scroogle, the Google search, but, at the same time, leaving intentionally no record) . 
The number of people, deliberately, did not record on pages public that it will not be possible to find them, no less. The services of Google online, through word processing in image processing, to the reading of information can be replaced with alternative formats, which are not connected to enormous servers parks and assemble not our best profile, had existed to date. 
The public expects, without actually in hiding, when Google unveil its true nature. 
The company's current value of $156 billion, worth more than IBM ($ 140 billion) , Intel ($ 124 billion) and Coca-Cola ($ 110 billion) . The areas advertising AdWords AdSense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while benefits introduced at speeds increasingly important cause of serious migraine not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
However, critics of the find, next to all this, contradictions with the worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, employees protests, after it has doubled the price of the company tongue and after the corporation has seen too expensive the restoration multiple daily, taken any time. It all sounds ridiculous next to the fact that in 2006, Google agreed to the Chinese government and by the terms of their agreement, the company detects all results injured taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to a of internal rules of society, new services are not announced when they can be used. What is on is that in the coming months and years to come, they will move the world on new issues. While some believe the project of analyze and archive of books and periodicals of Google is taking so important dimensions that the company will soon be faced with the United States Supreme Court, other trembling to his system Health, because in it, you can build a comprehensive medical benefit from our results of previous analyses, our physicians and our problems. 
The fact that Google assembles a genetic database can provide a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel's famous Cory Doctorow, written with demi-tons Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached to alarming levels alone through data from Google. 
Two miners have helped to remove traces of double homicide of Ózd 
" The police summoned two miners to be questioned in the case of double homicide of Ózd From suspicions they helped to remove traces of the crime. '' said commission spokesman Department of Borsod. 
Young people have recognized the crimes of which they are accused. At the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two miners, who, according to the information of MTI (Agency Telegraph Hungarian) are girls, defending themselves free. 
The murder complicity might produce a detention up to 5 years. 
The suspect's twin homicide of Ózd, a young man's corner 23-year-old, was placed in temporary custody, Sunday. 
The charges brought against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interests. 
During the investigation, it was found that the young man of 23 years was a lot of money to a 53-year-old man. 
The suspect did not resolve its debt and that is why it drew its lender, last Wednesday at a site Ózd where he has killed, and the girl of this man, aged 9 years. 
Based on the information of MTI, the young man was premeditated crime. The weapon with which he would commit his crimes hidden crime for is proof of that. 
The police examined the weapon and the circumstances of their use with the help of experts. 
The award of Warsaw made a proposal for the election of the award from Prague 
The Stock Warsaw has proposed EUR 200 million, about 5 billion kronor Czech, for the redemption of 100% of the package of shares on a stock exchange of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the President of the Stock of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite that, previously, the Czech have ruled out the award of Warsaw circle of new owners potential of the award from Prague. 
The reason for this exclusion is that the award of Warsaw is owned by the state. 
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to distance himself from more than 60 percent of its shares in a few months of operation. 
According to the business daily Czech E15, the proposal of the Polish represents the highest bid that has been made to date for the redemption of the award from Prague. 
The Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the Director of the award from Prague, said last week that among stakeholders, the award of Warsaw would the new owner the poorer, and did not rule out that this would lead to the disappearance of the award from Prague in the future. 
The value of the award from Prague is estimated to be between 5 to 10 billion kronor Czech experts on the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of paper would be sold. 
The largest owner of the award from Prague is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of interests, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. has. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press 
In their comments of Tuesday on the international financial crisis, worsening by the day, the newspaper leaders of the European press conjure already a second September 11 ''. 
" The global financial disaster, this is to the American president " accused the newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. `` He was not even able to stand together with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a rush to give assistance to a situation heartbreaking. 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as was once suggested the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to refer to a second September 11. 
Part of the press Madrid also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of newspaper El Mundo, this is the case for the political direction of there who led the world economy on the verge of collapse. 
The danger of collapse of the US financial system increases every day, and subsequently, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote of the convention, a real danger threat that Washington is not proposing a policy tool for addressing the crisis. 
The global economy hangs in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the largest transformations. 
Neither can we ignore the threat longer-highlights the Tages-Anzeiger Geneva. 
Some states may still pursue a lifeline to their financial organizations titubants, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapsing like dominoes, then and the financial means, or of new improvisations does will be enough. 
In the long term, we need that the States of the European Union are few cases of their national egoism, and centralize the control over financial markets divided. 
That Monday, financial companies weakened received over EUR 100 billion-recalled the daily Vienna, Der Standard, adding that the fears that the European taxpayers also have to have to pay, very deep, similar to the U.S. to address the crisis, becoming more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really busy of the crisis, which, as a tsunami, , running from one end to the other, the old continent. 
The `` rescuers " should not use straight EUR 100 billion, this advisable if they recorded in which case it would be reasonable to touch with taxpayer money, with the goal of preventing greater damage. 
The intelligent car mimics the flight of Bumble Bee 
What method would be easier to develop technologies able to avoid an obstacle, if not the imitation of a barrier detector already existing in nature? 
As for example, that of bees. 
In the draft surprising at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, bees bourdonnantes got the idea strategic of departure for engineers in Nissan, for inspire on what they should design the next generation of barriers detectors. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a tiny robotic car, a system to control auto-robotisé bio-inspiré, type BR23C, he has fitted with the qualities of bees, the goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of preventing all obstacles. 
At its flights, each bee is its own space, oval, which in fact, very similar to our secure protection hull said at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the department head research and development and technological public relations of the mark. 
The eye to angle of the bee is crucial, since it is able to see in all directions, in a corner of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye to angle, engineers have discussed the idea of scanner to laser. 
It identifies the barriers in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres to the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which into avoidance maneuver. 
The perception of the barrier occurs in a split second, and then the mini car robot, replicating the movements of bees, exchange immediately the direction of its wheels in the shift from an angle sufficient to prevent the collision. 
Contrary to all current, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively. 
" If that were not the case, the mini car robot can not respond quickly enough to avoid the preventing '' said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory Mobility and project robotic car. 
It must react instinctively and instant, as this technology is the most vulnerable section of and internal the envelope of protection, a layer which for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
Throughout this process should reflect what the bee done to avoid the other bees. 
The process must take place in the blink of an eye. 
By contrast of bees, the difference can not go back up, down or in diagonal, it can not be in two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels might prove. 
In this way, in place of endless combinations that have bees to prevent the other bees, in our case, it was unable to use that the rotary motion, the acceleration and the slowdown as labourers for the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses of battery Lithium polymer which are lighter and whose energy level is higher, which makes their longer life spans in the version Lithium-ion. 
As far Andoh is the intelligent response instinctive which is essential, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store. 
This mechanism should only cover some incoming signals per second, and respond to them. 
No need to store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous exercises, so it uses only a few dozen of memory kilobytes in continues. 
It is not necessary to memory with a capacity of gigabits and megabytes. 
That is the first step toward developing a technology for the avoidance instant. According to the estimates of Nissan, this system will enter the cars mass-produced in the next ten years. 
Another application could be incorporated in the GSP satellite navigation system, so that he could guide the driver to its destination avoiding the hurdles on the way. 
It has even been given a name the baby overpriced 
The written version of the economic rescue plan $700 billion to buy the credits dubious of banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent. 
Reuters reported that in further discussions is extended until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the East Coast, Congressional leaders agreed on the controversies that have been in existence for days, around the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion. 
" We conducted a major leap '' said Nancy Pelosi, the president's Democratic US House of Representatives, after which we can only put the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is sustained by the two candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, said in a comment on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures have still to be implemented, and it takes Pelosi, is not the forum, bailout of Wall Street, but to run the workings of the economy in the other direction. 
The print version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday night at 8pm local time, Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe, but did not induce dramatic rise in the awards. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the draft law responding on behalf of stabilization law emergency economic 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi and then, the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
" We are pleased with advanced with that night, and we are very appreciative of the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy '' said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
In addition, the program is different from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which said that the $700 billion should be spent once, and for the redemption of securities on questionable credits. 
Now, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent. The former 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first will be spent in Treasury Secretary to buy bad loans of banks, while the use of the $100 billion more will be at the discretion of the Chairperson. 
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participated. 
The cost of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Order of Congress. 
By law, the Secretariat at Treasury can develop a combined strategy: it will, at the same time, buy bad loans, securities on mortgages and mortgage meltdown, as well as other types of receivable '' toxic ". 
The good people of the Department reported that the buybacks may take place as part of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule allows the companies involved, taking part in an insurance program, where the secretariat in Treasury guarantees the tools at the origin of concern, for which the companies have paid a premium equal to damages predictable. 
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the tools needed to spend $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, be they large buyout of doubtful debts, of their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system entrainant the collapse of any major financial institution. 
" We shall take the necessary measures, so as to be prepared for the administration of the Act, as soon as it is signed "-he said. 
By contrast, the leaders of the banks located in awkward sustained postures and waiting government assistance can expect of their severance, called simply golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The salary cap is mentioned only in specific cases. Moreover, limitations depend on how the Secretariat at Treasury offered help to the company. 
The cap principle means that if the Secretariat at Treasury buys as part of an auction, they charge a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the bank president discredited parte retirement. 
Immediately after the redemption of bad loans, the Government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to officers is not an exaggeration. 
For the picture be complete, however, I should add that the golden parachutes existing not be changed. The cap applies only new business, this to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that ceilings on legal are in effect on the allowances of Directors General-said the chairman of the committee in charge of financial services of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
In addition, the state will provide a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, so that taxpayers risk decreases as they may even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it saved banks will fall on their legs. 
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the Speaker must submit to Congress a proposal to decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
Both sides, there were of course those who have expressed doubts with regard to this plan. 
That's not what the American citizens we have mandated, this does not protect taxpayers ' dollars he said Republican of California, Darrell Issa. 
Her fellow Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur believe that they are the same who are urging the measures were taken, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Obama and McCain supported both the bailout of banks 
On Sunday, Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major parties in America, acted of their support the government's rescue of $700 billion. However, there are politicians who require the resignation of US Treasury Secretary. 
After marathons negotiations that have dragged on for days, officials in Congress and the administration had finally announced Sunday at dawn, they have made agreements in principle on the rescue plan for banks. 
This funding plan, aimed at thawing of the crisis on Wall Street and the credit market paralyzed, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are even, each as more effective than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
In opinion polls most recent, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama was again successful in getting a bit ahead. The advance of McCain, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, was cut. 
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit Sunday, Obama has expressed the hope that Congress to vote quickly on the bailout of 700 billion. 
He stressed that the proposal contains passages of consumer protection that it also supports. 
" This action should start now, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your job, your savings, industries as a whole and the stability of the whole economy '' he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.

The media review's territory German language 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters are more aware-and this is referred to the Der Spiegel, the low score of CSU in the country Bavarian. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel. de) 
In the online edition of the magazine of German left information, Franz Walter analyzed the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled `` The revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers ". 
As far political scientist recognized, the erosion of CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber can take up its duties. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed the Bavaria for decades and now, it is these people the modern their looking back. 
This time change is also the problem of any democracy Christian, and thus, also that of Angela Merker. 
At CSU, the failure was not entirely surprising, but Sunday, is coming to an end a process which was likely ago, just 10 years: the unquestionable dominance of national party ended. 
There are this decade, in 1998, the CSU is collected with 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent. 
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections of 2005, that is, at the time of invoked so Stoiber. 
The cause can be attributed to the modernisation '' devouring its parents '', implemented in the region consistently by the CSU. 
It is 40 years since the sociologists say it but they are highly misled about the pace. However secularization, the outcomes of education and the establishment of German's northern and eastern in the region of Bavaria, developing, could not remain without consequences on the voter loyalty CSU. 
Modernisation is accompanied by increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it's just inside the party that voters have become more aware of, more critical and more become. 
It is amazing that during recent weeks, this is precisely the citizens groups of classic themselves rather remote from CSU, such as independent, artisans and pan holders and the degrees above. 
In these groups, support for the CSU has dropped below 40 percent. 
Die Presse (diepresse. com) 
In its section entitled `` Who? With whom? The party chairman stand on the reserve address issues of the coalition, '' the Austrian newspaper Conservative to be devoted to the position of the domestic policy confused that has arisen after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialists SPÖ like to discuss with the conservatives ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ meddle in its internal affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. We Greens do not yet want to reach agreement on a coalition. 
The elections were held now, revolves around the coalition. in the debates held in the public television, the party leaders have barely suggest their cards. 
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that it wished to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that the cooperation of both parties is actually possible-it is what already exists in some regions and in the partnership Socialist. 
The question that imaginerait a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, direction Schüssel-Molterer was, in any case, rejected. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Molterer has reacted cautiously to the proposals of red. 
As we have already stated, a consultation will be ineffective if Faymann try to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or entering in the coalition is momentarily a question quite open. These items must be debated in the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the President of BZÖ, is again open to all proposals. 
" To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to take responsibility government "-said Haider. 
Járóka said: We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and the segregation 
Today, began in Paris, the Summit the European on equal opportunities, including the host is France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation to the House, as one of the principal spokespersons of the Expert Panel, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz the European People's Party, has called attention ségrégations in education, because it is a violation of the law that is most Roma children and thus, one of the main constraints to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was initiated firstly, Xavier Bertrand, the French minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for work, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
Among those invited to participate in this consultation, we find the European social partners, as well as the foremost representatives of the legal protection and European civil organizations in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Member Fidesz People's Party, Járóka has warned that on top honors found in hiring, Roma and disappear from the labor market, in the first place by their low qualification. 
" An overwhelming majority of young Roma lack high-school diplomas, and accordingly of elementary education for poor quality, only a tiny fraction have the opportunity to pursue a graduate degree. '' 
Furthermore, Járóka insisted the education as the fundamental right of human beings play a key role when assert other fundamental rights. 
The investment in the early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to an MEP, it is necessary to be aware of these reports in a widest possible audience, among the Roma and the non-roms. 
Indeed, earlier a child Roma started school, he increase her chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; by taxes paid out of his income and drinks, he is involved in the state budget. 
" By their nationality of the European Union, the Roma must be confident of their right to quality education, and be protected from low education quality and sectarian. '' said Lívia Járóka. 
According to the MLA, a collaboration of the European Union directed towards a goal and an action is needed to an immediate acceleration of the process of segregation of schools. Overall, the compliance of anti-discrimination existing and in preparation is of paramount importance. 
" They must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. should be given the opportunities provided by democracy these children, so they could participate as full citizens the right to the future of Europe, '' insisted Járóka. 
On behalf of the ` European Year for Equal Chances " provided to all, the Summit's goal for equality of opportunity in Europe held every year since the summit last year in Berlin, is to ensure a unique platform for supporting actions in favor of equal opportunities and to the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and within the Member States. 
CSU: thanks for a transitional period 
In October the decision on the fate of the duo failed Huber-Beckstein 
Despite this pitiful failure in the electoral heads have not yet fallen and the debate on personal issues in the summit's CSU Bavarian was deferred. 
The party chairman, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place; the question is how late last the grace? 
The fate of tandem, who suffered a catastrophic voice loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the party congress exceptional, taking the last weekend of October. 
The members of this pair heavily criticised have, in any case, the impact is they did not specifically to their seats. 
Thanks to this, they have tried to appease angry members of the fraction and the base, who a day after the ` tsunami Bavarian " have demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
Ago five years-it is true, again under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career-the union socio-chrétienne won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there is 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the `` single sovereign " of Bavaria giving 18 per cent of GDP German. 
However, the Tories are still relied heavily in this region of southern, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal restructuring of the party, the Vice-President and the federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, touted as a possible successor of Huber, also received a place in the modest recognition group, who initiate discussion on the job with the Liberals FDP, and with Electeurs Libres, trained along the right values, about a possible coalition government of Munich. 
A mockery of strange of fate was that the list of Electeurs Libres, between in legislation the Gabriele Pauli, including the taking of measures against Stroiber served coup possibility perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then proceed bluntly the very ambitious woman municipal politics. 
Now, leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, somehow, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, who to date neared the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. Former leader of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on September 28 as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber had launched some trenchant points to the CDU and believes they deserve much more support from the party brother. 
Others politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the elections Bundestag, which will be held in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor that if they give up one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played a significant role in the success of the National. 
On after Merkel, hiding hardly his disappointment in the failure, the loss of the land of CSU not playing negatively the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What is yet on as it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of Social Democrats lasts forever. 
Since 1946, the SPD has proved the worst performers with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko his rivals: 110-0 
No member of the opposition has not accessed the Belarus parliament after Sunday's elections. 
According to the Russian observers, it is because of a country governed by Alexander Lukashenko, who will prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) , it is because something illegal committed during the counting of the votes. 
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections. 
While the legislative composed of 110 people in the country of 10 million people is very good of objection for many decades, before the election of yesterday, the opposition between its forces under the name Forces Democratic Nations (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of President for the fourth time in Ugly Elections, the footsteps of the constitutional amendment in 2006, `` would " this time when very few Members of the opposition in parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ has waived his boycotting previously anticipated. 
The fact that Belarus, dependent, economically increasingly Russia wants to enhance its relationship with the EU, due to the political order Belarus qualified undemocratic, Lukashenko and several highly placed politicians do not receive a visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus's take a credit because of the reduced natural gas imports from Russia, always more expensive, and it contributed to the shift of society Beltransgaz, owner of gas pipelines crossing the country, fell into the hands of the Russian. 
The fact that the OSCE, for the evaluation of the campaign, focused on the positive changes rather than on failings, such as the ban run for a third candidate to the opposition, was referring to an appeasement. 
However, news of the OSCE Monday challenged already the campaign, during which most of the candidates to the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition feels a tangible improvement in the regime: the political detainees have liberty, and Minsk is ready to small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to acknowledge the South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated of Georgia, but Russia with which the Belarus form a confederation of on paper considers the two independent territories last month. 
" We made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU '', said Mr Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the applicant in the opposition presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that remain this way, despite that `` the power was afraid in this Parliament that no weight to move even one opponent ". 
The opposition is not planning to protest actions in the light of the results. It is trying instead to get his message on the need for economic reform with the voters. 
" Of course, we have a lot of trouble in this area: we must print our opponents newspapers in Russia, local authorities put up obstacles to the broadcast, but I can see also that they are increasingly at supporting the elections, even in the group of elderly '' said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers the social security as its main result, the pensioners layer the most sustained officially no longer regard really as appropriate. 
" Because of the bad debt situation and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of the social security, 'évoquant the silence of a cimetière', is just a matter of time '' -- believes Milinkevich. 
Unlike the politician from the opposition, the Russian observers have described the democratic elections. 
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: `` The people do not believe in words, but in deeds ''. In this way, the absence of the opposition that proof of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: ` A from today, breakfast before the rest. 
Never in the history of the Palais Chigi, not only had been revolving door for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from d‘aujourd'hui, is in effect this new measure against the clever, against which advanced and will then drink the coffee in a bar while on duty. 
The novelty anti loafers was made today by the Minister of Administration Service, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi. 
`` The doors tournantes- tells Brunetta- are a tool to facilitate the work, with more productivity, more attendance and over services '' said Minister Rock. 
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency. 
" It's réformisme " underscores Brunetta. 
The facility in all institutions of the Council Presidency is complete with the Palais Chigi. 
According Masi, '' the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view. 
No resistance from the employees was not registered, provides the Secretary-General, ` It is a process shared by employees, and we had the cooperation of all ''. 
In short, over breakfast during working hours; more coffee and croissant. 
Brunetta Promise, suggesting with a smile, `` a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. of the morning is a good and safe resolution ''. 
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure of the Public Service 
Of Rome, the Minister discloses that '' (a) online three months, sickness absences public employees have been reduced by 50% , 60milles more workers in a year ''. 
He adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Administration Service. 
Italian, '' whose vibrant salariales- explains the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond the inflation rate. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, joined forces to challenge the standards of Order Brunetta making use of Codacons. 
" " while the Minister of Public Employees mention today of the reduced absenteeism at the workplace due to maladie- written Association consommateurs- the people of `` loafers asset '' continues to grow. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of staff of the Administration Service decent and productive, have come together in order to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the order. 
In particular, at the Tar, disputed the exclusion of additional allowances in cases of disability due to service; the extension of schedules hours of permanently worker home sick, during which are made out inspections and other items from the new arrangements by the Minister. 
Accidents at work, Napolitano follows: '' Prevention crucial " 
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 people who remain invalid. standing 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm that dead white have been about 1.200. 
The figures attest to the seriousness of the problem that remains a leading cause of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicide. 
To get the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this aspect dramatic, Anmil famous today, in all provinces Italian, the 58th National Day of accident victims on labor, institutionalized the second Sunday in October. 
" The worrying data released by the Anmil, and the tragic events of recent days, supports the importance of the issue of prevention in the workplace ', says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message to the president of the Anmil, National Association of maimed and labor invalids, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses its `` sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort sector in favor of prevention at the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims ' families and the awareness of public opinion '' 
" outraged course, everyone was struck down to end such tragedies which, by their nature, are the media clamor and involvement of the public, although the daily reality has tragic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics. 
Napolitano not hiding `` There is certainly a matter of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information '' 
The many initiatives promoted in the education sector, are of particular importance to a realization more directly from the young people entering the world of work. 
It is our responsibility to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not under assess the alarm on the severity social, apply and enhance the legislative standards. 
For his part, the Speaker of the House of Gianfranco Fini said at how " this phenomenon of dead white is an absolute social urgency, who insult the conscience of all of us, and all the Institutions must, to make an effort concrete to stop quickly ''. 
Data injured on the job appears to be a slight positive trend, but that does not mean that the number of dead white is still impressive " said later the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
" we do not want this `` trend downwards ' mean in fact a minor attention, because it is precisely when the focus acquittal on what the tragedy. 
" we believe that in general, it is not doing enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through many actions. '' 
`` According nous- said Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as a most important speech on the training of workers, and this school onwards. '' 
It has ajouté- " which must be make a further effort in terms of communication and awareness of the public. 
" But the most important thing, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers, faced with a phenomenon which is a social emergency ''. 
`` Mercandelli subsequently criticized `` the progressive deterioration of conditions for the Protection of the allowance provided for victims of work ' and the ` assistance drift toward which the system is moving in recent years ''. 
`` The purpose is to give back to the worker the insurance coverage -- he ajouté- to the fate of those who has an accident, should not depend on spontanéisme or of enlargement of legislators '' 
Player Mp3 having fingers pointed at them, they put at risk the hearing. 
It of music at full volume for an extended period using portable musical instruments such as the readers Mp3, may cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
That announcement of the European Commission, which, in a press release issued in Brussels, quote the opinion of the Scientific Committee on health risk unexpected and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
" of this report scientifique- read we in the note- it is clear that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to music at full volume using apparatus portable music, for more than an hour per day, per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability. '' 
" I am concerned about the fact that so many young people who frequent users of musical instruments laptops and mobile phones at full volume, can damage unconsciously their hearing irreparably " says Meglena Kuneva. 
" " The data scientifiques- continues the responsible Ue- it is a clear risk and we should act quickly. 
What matters most is to alert consumers to make this information public domain. 
We need to review in addition, existing control systems seen scientific opinion, so as to be fully effective and able to follow the new technologies ' 
Brussels has asked the Committee of Independent Scientific examination of the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise that they generate. 
" The scientifiques-conclue the executive Ue- confirm that there is every reason to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now look with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could be adopted, if necessary to better protect children and adolescents, from exposure to noise from music devices and portable devices like. 
There is already a European standard of safety which limits the level of aircraft noise portable music to 100Db, but concern is growing about the damage hearing that could be derived from excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to carefully limit this data with solutions as the reduction of the levels and duration of exposure to noise. 
The Scientific Committee EU notes that the device users portable music, that listen to music at full volume -- over 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceeding the limits currently in force on the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods, likely a permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years. 
This interested in 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their numbers may be quantified to around 2.5 to 10 million people in the E.U. 
Rome, Alemanno gave the go-ahead to take the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we start in March we end in June will are. 
That is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the `` Commission for the future of Rome Capital ", which took place this morning at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes of Caracalla. 
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome. 
In March as they complete, the committee and the Council communal evaluate the analyses and proposals, to submit in June, the Strategic Plan to Rome with the `` stamp official ' of Capitol Hill and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
" " The Commission is totally independent; all political, social, cultural ideas there are représentées- like to stress Alemanno- it will offer insights Development Rome for use political decision-makers, which remain the Committee and the Council communal. 
No overlapping of roles, but only the willingness to have a corner where develop a major project to Rome. 
In March, it will have finished its tasks and disappear afterwards, because it must have a precise temporal period. 
In juin-annonce the maire- we will present the Strategic Plan from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. '' 
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that his opinions will be binding, Alemanno replica: `` Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and for the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France with the Commission Attali, and to Rome, I am on, his input will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is frustrated by the day-to-day and emergencies that arise from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see progress, and further, to a prospective deeper, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. '' 
In addition, the mayor of Rome like to point out that `` this Commission is not a useless body or a set bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost another euro to urban Roman and serve to investigate and engage the best minds expressive Capital. 
For Alemanno, in effect, `` we need a draft strategic reference or firm or immobile to our city, of self-improvement, which it desperately needs, while thinking their future now a spirit of unity, ''. 
A future which, says the mayor of Rome, '' will not be limited to usual municipal borders, but that look more loin» not only from the perspective of future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in the role Rome can and must have as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. '' 
Obama? The first anti-American president. Therefore. 
A famous American politician who wants to go to independent, wrote: `` Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
One was Jimmy Carter, who, by its decisions, destroyed the economy USA and were reports (as well as he ever since, as a citizen private) with the enemy of Islam ''. 
The attacks on Obama go up the date of the election gets closer. 
One lady of Miami has written on a website: `` this person is full of ambition ''. 
Obama's really rich. he believes he will win the most senior of a nation with a total of two governors and five senators black! '' 
This is, of attacks that not say not much; they are attacks course of racially, and do not respond to the question of all voters: Will a good President? We also the polls, who all claim that Obama wins and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is also about someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
One newspaper Mississippi, in the bellies Southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, then we know who the American patriot will vote. 
And that is one aspect of the American mentality secret until the end. 
" Say what you like, we see ourselves to the cross, on Obama or McCain. 
They are the same people who swear that if Obama wins, we leave the United States. 
Things never been to date, such that the success of a black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
Were asked to 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent said: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was back in her home in kicked buttocks. 
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the U.S. have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
Still, Iraq has, for the most part, been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will be a huge task to accomplish. 
Usa, the economic collapse are felt even among journalists: in the press is the deletions hour. And many accuse Internet, this `` murdering " newsprint. 
Five hundred American journalists have been arrested by the PEW Research Center over the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not stated openly attachés of information, feeling less worried about the credibility. 
They did not feel isolated as they once did. 
The problem of American journalists, the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for those journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed. 
In addition, deletions to the at, in the room where the editors working on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem. 
It is a problem that needs to be solved by the journalists interviewed, if we want the traditional journalism such as the general public will, will be reduced accordingly. 
A evident but complex pessimism invades the American journalism. 
Six in ten senior executives and journalists of newspapers Printing are convinced that journalism at national level is going through a bad way. 
Locally, the Executive Group is. 
Print Publication against broadcast. 
Reporters are not hard to see where will the Web. 
The largest houses publishers are finding a path to the Internet, viewed by many as ` the murderer ' newsprint. 
The `` pressure economic '' that feel the journalists is increased to 79% . 
The 500 journalists polled admitted to get the technology hoping that it `` do something of right '' for their journalism. 
Today, hitch the largest in the American journalism lies between leading the newsrooms- i.e. directeurs- and reporters who work for them. 
56% of principals at national level, are convinced that the reporters shared their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23% . 
For some, this is related to the `` safety. 
The principals who believe lose their jobs in the space of three years, were 47% nationally. 
As regards the journalists, we are going to 30% . 
The one of the `` work safe ' at the staff level (our writers, ndr) in America is still on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists are on contract. 
In a large nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly became a question of take it or leave it. 
They are almost always of earners, while the writer can win 10mille dollars per month, in addition to the pension insurance payment. 
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days, spent a number of years. 
But, according to their reports, the American journalists, are often `` patients '' during the year. 
It is the fault of climate. 
UNIPOL. COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST A GROTTAFERRATA. 
The President of the second section Criminal Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the authority of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be allowed to leave his hometown, Grottaferrata, for a unit in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the instructions for the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
At trial custody, last week, he had obtained the release home converted mandatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had called the real estate agent can make the journey of the province city in a house in the capital. 
According to the Court, this travel (that the pm has not granted they would influence its society and have access to evidence that accuse. 
The elites in danger. 
This was already evident a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary rescue plan to $700 billion approved by the White House -- a good number of U.S. was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street to save the U.S. economy. 
And that is the New York Times yesterday who confirms it calling that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, even more divided between his soul eve of the East Coast, moderate, a spokesman for federal institutions and the business community, and his new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to `` those of Washington " and the world of finance, powerful mostly in the countries of central and South. 
The soul, indeed, that is despotic fashion sense with the vote I mentioned at the beginning. 
But what I have just mentioned is just one example of change, of significant changes in the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement either have already run: not just to the United States, but across the West, and can be not only here. 
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seemed to accelerate the effects set for some time, to the extent that, in the new climate, they strengthen and prove. 
The first of these developments is the review, the extraordinary revival of the dual class Etat- sovereign, relative to a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis is, in fact, a institutions crisis bancaires-financières who have, of course close ties abroad, but, above all, are involved in large-scale the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This creates an immediate political problem for that rules over it: that is to say as addressing the problems and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economically World but politically, there is almost than here National. 
The internationalization policy seems really out of the game or, has very little to say: the clear evidence we is provided by the European Union which, shared as usual, among the various interests, and the various national strategies, came to decide no common political lines. 
And so, this is the Government of each State that all interventions expectations, plans for rescue and recovery, of the new rules, especially any condition of credits: once you going through a difficult time, there are only those States which have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in their places. 
They also have the necessary means and the legitimization for use two resources invaluable, of elements no contract or international organization can never have a similar manner. 
This new emphasis of the crisis nation state is perfectly consistent with the importance always major economic developments over recent of the economy tend to be attributed to a factor enough linked to this element: territoriality. 
. Ironically, in fact, while we were convinced that they have now entered into the kingdom's network, technology ever more sophisticated, not equipment, convinced that the global finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized of a sudden one, that our future will instead to settle its account always more with relatively few things material such as water, crops, oil. 
Things that can be transported from one place to another in the world, but which are linked convincingly to a confined space, a territory. 
Thus, which is sovereign, has more of cards that is not, in other words, those who have the misfortune to live in a place without harvesting, without oil and without water. 
I now come to the second new that it provides a fracture. 
Who said Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Policy, and therefore Leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena convergent. 
On the one hand, the awareness of the need objective of authoritarian leadership, looking for someone who can take responsibility for the situation. 
On the other side, a wave of discredit to the leadership of existing economic species that have proven to be inadequate and full of gray zone. 
Furthermore, something much deeper, in a way, even worrisome: a discredited, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance from that tends to involve the whole class of managers in a growing number of countries of the West. 
Then again increasing the understanding of the various classes, before the shares are the same ideas of social elites to date at their peak, their way to listen and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the word, to be the same time, and still be more foreign to majorities opinions. 
In short, The application of leadership, fuelling of underground fashion, a powerful and branched movement of délégitimassions ruling classes and political orders traditional, which emerge in the `` revolt " makeshift election or, in the mood changes collective of them very recently, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the collapse of Labour in Britain, with the rebellion of American delegates against Bush (and it may be that the victory of the right in Italy not reach by chance) . 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their customs, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, if someone, always have more difficulty, which is not new, to understand and to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, improves and wave potentially disproportionately. 
In view of all this, talk of a current ` masses rebellion " to the agenda, is decidedly excessive. 
But it is said, keep our eyes wide open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle for walking on the walls. 
Overcoming the laws of gravity through a super glue and, in the future, walk the walls like Spiderman. 
That is the purpose of various American research centres, and now, a team of four institutes was nearly succeeds. 
With an adhesive measured barely 2.5 centimeters square, the researchers were able to maintain glued a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
The ETUDE- The American journal Science published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of what we know who use a different structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes. 
" The principle of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes willing as a pile of spaghetti. '' Explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have used the feet of geckos, coated microscopic hairs that allow to the animal, a perfect connector. 
The testing various materials such as glass, Téflon, and the glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that il« moves easily from the wall " explains Liming Dai researcher in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton. 
GET ON THE MURS? -- `` this material may be used as an adhesive temporary '' said Liming Dai. 
May be to walk on the wall as Spiderman? May be that, yes, but researchers think use much less fascinating as the connection between the electronics, as the nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and of electricity. 
Other applications could include the aerospace engineering. 
For now, not of superheroes. 
THE OTHER RECHERCHE- The University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated also searching for a new adhesive. 
In an article in the American journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers from California presented an adhesive up microfibres hairs, who cleans car dust during the movement on an area to ensure full and consistent adherence. 
Medications: never with fruit juices. 
Look at grapefruit juice, orange and apple. 
These beverages consumed primarily in the summer because désaltérantes, rich in vitamins, if associated with particular vital medicines, alter the absorbement magnifying or reducing where possible, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risk of fruit juices as they are, canned or fresh, if due to ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, it launches a new warning: just one glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple, to reduce the absorbement of some vital medicines, canceling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
Grapefruit juice is already been strongly criticized because ultimately responsible to increase the effects of some drugs approved arrhythmic, antibiotics, anti-anxiety, anti staminales and neurological, up to toxic levels. 
MEDICINES A RISQUE- It is the Agency Italian of the drug itself, which gave the news in a newsletter dated two years, they warned doctors and patients not to in assessing the danger arising from this mix and to be aware of what we drink, considering of drugs such as Diazepam or the Methadone. 
NOT THAT THE PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, the orange juice and apple contains substances which inhibit the drugs. 
There is a long list of active ingredients hindered by grapefruit and other juices. 
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the Head of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Milan Public: ` such discoveries are in general, reported immediately to several national and international agencies of drugs that will need to change the policy briefs of drugs. 
It is always read the paper illustrative of drugs that are being taken, and, if anything is not clear, not to be impressed, but please contact clearly the physician or pharmacien '' said the expert to the agency Ansa. 
The Nobel of the economy to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at Princeton University and it is also a well-known columnist of The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms of solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more important than the first, in terms of the impact on American history. 
A forecast which unleashed numerous controversies, and who was alleged to the economist for years, but that now has been shown to be accurate. 
" I am surprised and a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, fell out of the attention of the public '' said Krugman. 
According Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a `` great economist value '', but also a discloser in style '' very aggressive, especially critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office is the third edition of the package anti-Microsoft " 
This is the day of the dissemination of OpenOffice. org.3.0, the following open source of personal productivity which aims to reach ever more users, from the house office, professionals to the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following nearly a year, directed by developers volunteers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new package Open Office is to the general public with various new: the welcome screen, and the interface journal and become less stark, to other more important, as the compatibility born for the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office has particular attention to the interaction of the Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (. docx, . xlsx, . pptx. ) 
As interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, as one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, send by e-mail, or to import leader PDF in the development module graphic, retaining the original aspect of the page. 
Still on this front, it is possible to create documents `` PDF hybrid '' between the typical graph of Adobe format to components of a spreadsheet or a text winemaker. 
The collaboration between several people is something which has had various improvements inside the applications: in the calculation sheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes in the development of texts, for to each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for greater recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are also working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud, and in the next few weeks, they should give the final result. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at it. openoffice. in download 3.0.0 download300.htmlet and is added to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday. 
Along with Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available in addition, for the system opératif Linux. 
Upon request, the facility cd can be shipped home or at work. 
And if the issue of free education can be a tool for the dissemination of homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the following attempts the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects in the public administration and schools. 
Excluding the realities offering training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium sized enterprises, which could also open to of business prospects. 
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for writing video equivalent of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet is to replace the Excel, Impress, for submissions rival PowerPoint, Dbase, as the famous Access, is the program to work on the databases; and Drwa is the graphic module. 
Objective for 2008, arrive at 5 million download, and considering that today it is nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that the release of the new version, we can exceed the projected number 
Kohl also, is positive is the fourth event of doping. 
New case of positive in the last Tour de France: the Austrian's team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of jersey for best grimpeur. 
It is the site of daily L'Equipe reporting the news. 
A 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Distichon, Abrév third-generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and Germany's Stefan Schumacher, too of Gerolsteiner. 
Blood tests conducted on the tubes of Kohl are part of those in recent weeks, laboratory in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm positivity in Distichon, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will necessarily exist expect two years of disposal. 
The news of the positivity of Kohl to the Abrév third-generation, was confirmed by the leader of the French agency anti doping, Pierre Bordry, which sent to the Associated Press, had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans stands on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the U.S. Cadel Evans, raflant and the jersey to peas the best grimpeur. 
IMMIGRES. NEW YORK TIMES SE CLAIM IF ITALY'S RACISTE? 
The Italy '' in which Country of immigrants recently has turned into a prime destination for immigrants ' greeted with reluctance. 
It would turn he the Beau countries into a nation of racist? That is what is intéroge the New York Times who has dedicated a large article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing cans of biscuits. 
This case demonstrates something which the New York Times described as `` the north paradox ": the northern regions are at the same time, where there has " more integration and more work, '' but also `` a sense anti-immigrés the strongest of the country and the biggest supporter to the Lega North '' 
To confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new Parliament advocated by the Lega to stem immigration and facilitate the return of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and by the President of the Republic follows: '' Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI Quirinal, commissioned the church state work together to combat racism. '' 
Students rent victims ladies, up to EUR 900 for a room. 
The market rentals for students not aware of crisis 
According to the latest survey Sunia, the tenants union, rent a single room can cost to a student, to 900 euros in Milan, 700 to Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
" The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of exclude whole categories of young, right to the study because of the overall costs very high that the families of from must soutenir- says the head of studies office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, high demand from students was so distorted the market that a process of growing was amorcémême for residents. 
Most of the lease offerings also include a series of violations. free type contracts, not registered, without limit of rent, subleases. 
For the Sunia, exceptional measures through the revision of taxation, are needed to calm prices. 
Lisant in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, on a bed in the area Brianza, it takes approximately EUR 450; for a single room, we will of 650 euros minimum (Field Band Nere) with an average of 800 (Field Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of EUR 900 (Field Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed costing an average 350 400 euros, a room approximately EUR 700. 
A Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, there 250 EUR 280 for a bed in a double, and 370 500 for a single room. 
A Rome, in the areas adjoining of universities Central San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna called approximately EUR 600 for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Values slightly lower (550 Euro for a simple) for the areas adjoining of other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà) . 
They can not save if you move away in the outlying areas: 300 Euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
A Naples, to a bed there 300 EUR 400, for a simple, it spends 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
A Bari, for bed, there are 250 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major issue in the economy Municipal. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often made by students extra-Community, there is an later anomaly: the rent charged to international students is increased by 25 30% compared to the rate charged on Italian. 
Farewell old Cinema Paradiso, cities address historic theaters. 
Theatres historical closed for Multiplex. 
" A city with no movie theaters is a blind city is like a face without eyes '' 
The image provided by theater director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what is happening in large urban centres Italian, but in provincial cities, 
The process of marginalization theaters, with the birth in the vicinity of large multisalles, and the death of consomption of mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the major events that we believe is inescapable and inevitable and is in addition all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
A disappear, are often historic sites and responsible for memory, '' it's as if a friend of mine disappeared, someone that you know, with whom we shared some way and many emotions '' observes director of Thorpe movie Paradiso, movie that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury at the Cannes, and that was on the poetry of a province room, and nostalgia for a way of life the movie, lost may be forever. 
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of shopkeepers, are trying to say: in the past five years, 316 traditional type cinemas have closed, and the halls of major cities who mostly paid the fee: 10 less to Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 and less in Turin, 5 Palermo. 
Among the hardest hit by the closure, Emilie Romaine is lead with 82 movie theaters mono lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and the Lombardy (41) . 
The evidence confirming that the lead of their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that experienced the most of new theaters multisalles: 195 screens in more in Lombardy last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilie-Romagne. 
" L'exploitation Italian grew unreasonably " observed Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, '' it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of existing ones, because when a firm room in a city, these fréquenteurs not necessarily all willing to go to multiplex. 
Not to mention the missed deliberation of credit for marketers: debt past of the state is some EUR 10 million. 
It is shameful that, in terms of ethics and morality, the Government not compliant with existing laws. 
To support the sector should be between 16 and 18 million a year. 
In the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a Memorandum between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote cinema halls mono of historic centres and peripheries. 
Among the standards proposed, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the area to traffic limited, and will special tariffs for parking and in some car parks. 
" This is an initiative which I think " observed Giuseppe Tornatore " and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures. 
Clearly, however, for contrasting the superpower of multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public of today is more demanding. 
The defense of traditional movie is something that for me has always been important: the closure of Supercinema of Bagheria, place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has convinced me to do, '' New movie Paradiso " which I thought had been 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto, or the Quirinal Via Nazionale, now closed, where I both lived of mixed emotions, I turn the other side not to see the signs vein by the dust. 
Links between policy and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
`` The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardise the election of the Mayor's office to clan interests Piromalli. '' 
Serious accusations are being launched by the magistrates of the Directorate anti-Mafia Calabria, against the mayor and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association. 
The lever also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and governments, and her little son lawyer, namesake of boss, already convicted for belonging to a criminal association of type mafia, and to pay EUR 10 million. 
" an affront to the legal and moral standards, and especially of good sense ' write prosecutors, the two local governments expressed the willingness to pay of consultations to Maître Piromalli. 
" Thus it would have been allowed to clan -écrivent the juges- formally enter inside the municipal authorities of facilitating opportunities, already considerable, of orientement of the public service ' 
The President of the Regional Committee calabrais Agazio Loiero, no secret that `` collusion between local committees and organised crime, there are more than one '' in his region ` there are places where the intensity mafia is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there are a lot of politicians that withstand the pressures of ndrangheta, heroes who are fair '' 
The arrests this morning after the last July, after which the police announced they décapitée the clan Piromalli. 
At the end of this April, the City Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of suspected drug between organised crime and the local government, local politicians had been emptied of their administration of the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, was appointed head of a coalition of center-right, after the run-off May 2006. 
He called in horror when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing to have instigated the while to a political issue, but given the request of incarceration signed this morning, the judges why the clan Piromalli was even able to claim the project variation of the A3. 
The ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, pm write, is tip " the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, represent a group best known, near of Piromalli, levelled the choice of public administration to clan interests. 
When the energy born of waves, now the big engage. 
This is a disproportionate accumulation occupying more than 70% of the area of the globe and now the major companies of world energy are in the process of discovery. 
Waves, currents, tides, these new sources of renewable on which colosses as Chevron pointed the eyes, and now trying to hand. 
The availability of energy from movement of the Sea is considered since now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research have intensified. 
When the price of oil fell to 1980, the idea of using the marine energy was set aside, but now the authorities environmentalists and the recent rise in oil give a major boost to the sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London said in 2007 that 15% of global need into electricity could be covered by operating systems of the sea swells. 
This amount would be twice that produced by nuclear power stations. 
And in addition, there would currents and tides. . 
Colosses to the attack. 
The first companies to capitalize on the marine energy was the Enersis, who in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal. 
When the deal was announced, it seemed a real not revolutionary. 
Two years ago, always many more candidates of these companies will always been conventional energy rely on energy Navy. 
" Chevron is investigating technologies on energy océanique- said the spokesman of a company associated with colossus American tanker, to business daily Wall Street Journal- and it assesses the possibilities to cooperate with us. '' 
Cooperation in question, for a permit advisement by the American committee for energy, needed to lead to a development project of the marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very important sign, especially considering that in Alaska, Usa continue to extract oil from, and recently President Bush has implemented a project for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who ply the route of energy from the sea, and money until now, while their details are known, indicate the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to. 
The experts say a technology still in its infancy, of the fact that the energy Navy does not eliminate the fears about the impact environmentalist. 
At the moment, systems such as Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not appear to create major problem with the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, requires the use of technologies with a higher environmental impact. 
" And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of floats connected. 
The surge of waves, which is driving the sludge up and down the, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside float. 
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator. 
Energy is sent to the shore across the cables under marine. 
At present we have four such systems in phase of the project, until a single federal approval and part of energy could be used to a military installation. 
Verdant Power, by contrast, already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking using six turbines in offshore of the East River of New York. 
The movement of water when the tide, runs the turbine blades, creating a rotational movement that drives a generator. 
Verdant announced it has a long list of clients waiting by appropriate authorities to tap energy. 
After ocean waves, tides. 
A particularly interesting, they say to the Institute for Research of electricity, deserves the moment, the potential of oil. 
Although this is a phenomenon intermittent, the tide is more predictable of wind, sun, waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely on energy of oil that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, with others, to look at the coast, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and invests up to 35 million in 2009.
