The Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament refused, within the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the project of cancellation of the paragraph relating to the inculpation of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The deputies refused in second reading the draft amendment aiming at the reduction of the sorrows for economic frauds, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned ex-First Minister.
Tymosenko was condemned in October to 7 years of prison to have concluded an agreement a priori detrimental with Russia for the purchase from natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the call of condemned in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the political judgment of revenge on the mode and caused a process of suspicions of partiality of the court also in the west.
The project to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-Premère Ministre was condemned, was signed by 147 deputies.
One would have needed 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victoire
The release or Libyan rebellion has already its defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is finished.
It remains to determine the winners.
As it is of habit in the area, the winners with the elections are the islamist ones, but acts it of moderate or the radicals.
The provisional National council issued the usual right of Charia and we know already what it acts.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight one cuts the hand.
The women can forget the emancipation, nonthe respectful possible ones of the faith are liable to the capital punishment…
In fact the Koran will link instead of the personality of the dictator the company made up of opposite tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot represent it to us and as we would surely not like.
But our way of living is not single, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that the islamist warriors accepted the assistance with recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse it is that it is not a general américian who directed strikings of NATO but rather Allah of which they celebrated the size with each attack.
When it is thus a question of seeking the winners in Libya, the occident is not part of it
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitiques was diverted of the dictator as a political ally without that not bringing any profit.
After recent the bad experiments of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
It there thus not of problem for the buildings to get rid of the “crusaders”.
Will the oil companies without occupation of the ground, have access to oil libyien easily.
Perhaps not as much and the occident will be able to be finally praised of a protection not involved in the human rights.
For little that we prevent these followers of the charia of them.
A new era of crisis starts.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sight of the investors.
A tornado of the statistics passed Tuesday on Europe.
Each state published reltives information with the GDP for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated these last quarters, whereas France and Germany are in growth.
The bond market breaks all the records.
The investors do not look at only Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro zone, of Germany, of Tchéquie and other countries of Europe earlier published their visions of economic development for the third quarters.
The GDP of Germany has a growth envisaged of 0.5%, that of France of 0.4%.
The two countries modified the data for the second quarters during which Germany placed itself than envisaged better (growth of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% envisaged), however France mentioned a light reduction of 0.1% (it was a question at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy had a growth of 1.5% during the third quarters.
But the GDP stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical office it is confirmed that one moves towards a progressive reduction in the economic growth.
The results are worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech économiqe had a growth of 1.5% during the third quarters but stagnated during er last quarters.
The German economy had with the third quarters a growth of 0.5% according to the data envisaged and recomputed periodically.
The economy of the euro zone and the European Union had a growth of 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarters, which corresponds so that the analysts had envisaged.
The Greek economy fell of 5.2%.
The output on the obligations over ten years is of 28.45%
The outputs of the obligations of Spain and Italy are climbing towards critical limits.
The problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc…
The outputs of the Czech obligations are maintained below 4% whereas the situation worsens in the area.
Voices are made hear in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of last authority.
Czech qualified itself for the EURO.
They gained in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The representation of football made a success of its more difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, it also gained thanks to super Cech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football dearly defended with also a good portion of chance in the second part her qualification and will not miss the championship of Europe.
IHNED.cz followed the match of qualification with a detailed report.
No the particular excitation during the first part and a great part of chance for the second.
The Czech representation also gained thanks to super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and festival its qualification with the championship of Europe.
The monténégrains were found under pressure until in the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The vicitmes of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic which flunked two chances to mark a goal.
And thanks to super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent with the championship of Europe the next year, and in more one reward of 200 million crowns in the case of Czech football.
As of the first minutes one played a warlike football.
The two teams managed with difficulty to assemble combinations and the play concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not manage to bore the Czech defense which answered in a precise way the long shootings even during the first half.
The Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their country.
They created a human shield
A few hundreds of students of the universities created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support by this gesture the nuclear program of their country vis-a-vis a possible Israeli attack.
The students started to request at midday in front of the site and then desired the death of HAVE and Israel.
A few hundreds of students of the universities of Ispahan created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technological center of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the program nuclaire of their country to the danger of their own lives.
The International agency for atomic energy (IAEA) noted in its last information that Iran did not cease reinforcing its nuclear armament.
One mentions State of Israel of a possible attack of the Iranian nuclear establishments.
The students started to request at midday in front of the site and then desired the death of HAVE and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Food of an obese child: does not have a breakfast not and takes pork-butchery for the dinner
More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 years has problems of overweight, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese.
As shows it current research the obese children come families which have an unhealthy lifestyle.
That shows again at which point the medium is important in which evolves the human being and the models which surround it.
On the tables of the obese children one finds for example pork-butchery 50% more often than in the families of children to the standard weight.
19% of obese had chips with the dinner according to the investigation conducted with a publicity campaign “Obesity is not a chance”
In the families of small large the sport is also not a practice, which is now the case of the majority of the schoolboys of today - only 15% answered that at least once per week the parents found time for active movement.
Inquire carried out into 900 children
The investigation proceeded during the last school year and took part 900 pupils of the elementary schools of Tchéquie.
It was the second edition of “Obesity is not a chance”, action supported by the general Insurance of health and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning it is more than 12000 first form pupils to the third who were registered with this project.
One of the determining factors which cause a dramatic increase amongst children in overweight, even obese, is the absence, of a correct food and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the questioned children indicates for example to eat 5 times per breakfast day case - to lunch - to taste to dine, which is one basic principles of a good food”, one of the results of the investigation indicates.
Without breakfast and pork-butchery with the dinner
The specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development one needs some basic details such as a breakfast in family per same hour.
In Tchéquie, only 23% of the families of the pupils eat per my same hour.
In the major part of the families each one has her breakfast alone.
And the worst which was raised is than a tenth of the population does not have a breakfast at all.
The breakfast is however the base of a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children one more often consumes of unhealthy chips.
Almost each pupil - without speaking of weight - drinks each day of sweetened drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the questioned children does sports regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the investigation made it possible to selected children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own food starting from possibilities suggested according to their own taste and their personal opinion.
“The preferences of the Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far, with the plan of a healthy food, ideal”.
Among their preferred dishes there are many cakes, the meats and the sugar refineries.
“More alarming is in particular a great preference for the sweetened lemonades”, is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For the lunch in fact the pastes took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starchy foods at all and the preference for fish and the meals of vegetables was very weak.
Cape on health
The investigation also showed that the children are ready to change their practices as from the moment when they receive the ad hoc information.
“During a control of a group of participants in the investigation who had filled the questionnaire after the meeting with sensitizing “Obesity is not a chance”, one has assity with a well defined will to move towards a healthy food”, the results of the investigation indicate.
Most outstanding was for example concerning the sweetened lemonades because the children started to give the preference to the water of consumption.
The children notched generally on the questionnaire the white meat and fish like main course and would reduce the sweetened dishes and the “knedliky” (spécialté Czech of pellets of potato or bread flour).
The designer must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a relative presentation article like learning for the designers, I put myself a little bit in anger owing to the fact that there was much as of the beginning.
I did not think of what was going to arrive thereafter.
Talks of three professionals of the speciality, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what occurs on the spot.
And it will be worse.
The more we approach the final examinations and the more practical exercises and information expect us.
And even when there are courses the samedis and dimanches it “is truly stuffed”.
This time we have with the Alenka director (with the course there is no boy) treaty in the way of equipping the woman who does not have measurements standards.
And of the women of this type it is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another of the overweight.
The designer must know how optically to reduce broad arms, to prolong a neck or to add curves necessary.
We were thus able to underline the character nicely and also not to equip in a too medium way of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and marked hips and a small size.
If there is for example a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or the pants do not pass at all, that is worth the blow to be made it make custom-tailored.
And you will not regret it because the clothing which tomb impeccably is priceless.
In a custom-tailored skirt you will feel much better than in that which slips permanently, is rolled up and does not hold with the belt and so on.
For those which have a male appearance have can allow a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of bent fabrics, or even of the embroideries.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am content that I have all the week to sort all the received information.
But I am also afraid that in view of what I must do at the house there too much is.
Each trainee accepted a celebrity to be equipped for the day and the evening.
We must take into account current appearance, the type of mode of the personality like its appearance.
I will have “to equip " Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know campaign the Secrecy of Victoria.
At the bottom of me, that pleases me, because it is better than to equip Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost hundred kilos lately (do not take my declaration, please, completely with serious) or the young person Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew starting from the magazines or seek on Internet, print and work graphics.
Moodboard, like one says for the final result, expresses our personal style like our relationship to the graphic design.
To also reflect on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The designer does not equip thus only the physique but creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on products given tendencies for the handbags, the coats, etc…).
Mario Kamenik, designer and graphic designer, maintained us all that.
But that,… until Sunday
The designer must have a general vision
Three guests of the speciality gave an aspect diversified to the meeting of Saturday filled of information on the various types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of mode and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded to us that the fashion is an illusion and the designer should know to use it.
And a designer of talent can work with only one clothing in a different way.
Variability is for this paramount example.
As for example this trench coat which must be carried in a traditional way with a Jean and a tee-shirt as a light coat but also it can also equip the naked body, with court shoes and take it in photograph like a dress.
Or it is enough to go up the handles or the collar and to have immediately a new look.
“Play with that " it underlined.
But I particularly appreciated the following council: “For work you need to know the rules perfectly”.
“You can then start to contravene it”, Jakub said.
Finally I understand why one endeavours to learn these rules, what to make with, towards what, why, whereas in the magazines of mode one sees sometimes something of other.
No declaration on the fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben whom the designer must have much more alternatives of clothing than those which are photographed.
I.e. that for fashion story which will have about ten pages (thus about ten models) I must be ready of “to recut " at least about fifteen.
And as, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently as actually.
We must take into account that during a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and the style make sometimes half of success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
It is enough to look at Madonna who is not a super singer but its image and marketing made a star of it world.
In Tchéquie, the approach towards the use of the services of the designers remains still frileuse.
And the known faces consider them sometimes as useless (it is enough that I know something but what I appear master key with the second rank).
And if somebody is made make a styling of our share, we must then count on the fact that it dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than that which it actually has.
It remains us then that to surf on google and to ensure themselves if information of boulevard mentions celebrity in question, if she lost weight or enlarged etc…
Honza and Mario posed to us Sunday on the heart which it is not enough for the designer to be directed in the fashion and to know to assemble models.
It must communicate with the people whom it equips and it is thus important to be a good psychologist.
To know to guess people, not to flatter, preserve its opinion.
“When a manager asks you of him to sort his cupboard and to fill it of new elements you cannot all throw and tell him, My God which horror.”
“You will find some business which you will find pretty and him that you will advise with what to carry them”, known as Mario.
This one concretely showed us what must all contain what one calls the “placovka " or bag of the designer.
It is that which you hang around the size and which you have on oneself for all which you need.
In addition to the clearly definite things like the scissors, the rollers for depilation or even the pins with nurse, one finds there also wire of nylon (that the designer uses to photograph products like bags, or many hats), of the special clips with which one closes a clothing in the back, if it is too large (the pin or another type of staple is not utlisables because they could damage clothing) or a kit of seam.
So that we did not soyions only people who listen but which tested something in way practices they taught us how to sole shoes correctly.
And during the photo meeting in the workshop where surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, a fortiori with lexterior.
And thus we stuck and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors not to be wounded by inadvertency.
Truly competences are thus needed.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me for my creation.
The comptence of which I mention is not for my girlfriend.
This is only one small summary of what we learned during the second weekend from course
I start more and more to understand that to make styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of pinks, that each one says of them what he wants.
The need speed Run disputes through all America.
Revision
In the beginning a race without problem changes because of a whole of stupid errors people who do not have anything of it to make in a morning displacement creature of habit with work.
That fills until a certain measurement the ambition of each one but that is not used for nothing if nobody wants to do something moreover.
The new subtitled part The Run produced great waitings before its exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of already old race Need for Speed and to leave a kind of play starting from the playable parts which would not be taken into account only points.
We were thus curious how will be the passages added during which the principal hero leaves his car and fact what it has desire.
Like that is already made in the series NFS, the result is completely other than what one atttendait.
They are potentially plays of race of arcades but the unit draws downwards because of some useless faults which already have existed for several years.
They are not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on behalf of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken in the adventure whose hero principal Jack has characterial problems and to regulate them starts to take part in illegal races through America.
You sit down behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first at New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then besides 50 races.
What results from it that each race is done on another route and the stages envisaged in different environments which are distinguished from/to each other rather well and are interesting.
The player does not have the urgent only one feeling that the play proposes something of identical to him.
Certain environments are in addition rather pretty even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the preceding series.
Finally it is not the end of the world.
But control through the desert, in landscapes of autumn or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests besides time in time are decorated of an atypical element.
For example in the desert you find yourselves in a sandstorm which decreases you in a significant way the visibility.
Then in the mountains you must pay attention so that an avalanche does not fall you above.
Concurrently to that the various races are well arranged the ones behind the others.
There is only one small number of it but that is enough.
It of the moments you endeavours there to exceed the number requested of adversaries (as in a traditional race) then you will run against the watch (duel traditional with the stop watch) and then still another duel with an adversary expects you.
From time to time you have also the police which enters the play and which tries to return the difficult situation to you.
The innovation are the passages except vehicle.
It is rather about una interactive animation when most of the time Jack flees in front of somebody and you must help it while typing on the good button at the good moment.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising it is that there is less of moments of this type than than you wait (to be concrete there are only three of them).
With the result it is well like that because this element is not likely to obstruct and is placed, in the context described above, the elements which decorate the play.
The model of control is in the tradition of the preceding plays.
What means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but one cannot say that it is negative.
Concerning realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.
But although one can better find in the conccurrence the model of control goes very well with the type of design of the races.
Thus all is ok.
The problems start to appear after a certain time.
Unlike the model of control, that of the collisions is not yet at the point.
We do not expect EC play a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, at the time of a collision with any object, the least idea in the way in which your car behaves, it is thus not completely good.
During tight goings beyond you touch yourselves sometimes mutually slightly but otherwise your car leaves in insane stunt-flyings.
Or finds itself in crumbs.
Thanks to the system of restarting that is not really a problem but that really aggravates you.
The restarting is made so that when you broke the figure or you left in the decoration the play brings back for you at the time of the last point on the route.
But you have only 5 restartings.
When you used the 5 restartings you must start again the play since the beginning.
It is thus more one tool, for the case where something does not occur as it is necessary, than something on which you can truly count.
Sometimes the restartings do not help and it is necessary to find the solution by remémorrant of memory the piece of route in question.
The great difficulty of this play it is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example there are certain turns which it is necessary to pass in a certain way if not that does not pass.
Otherwise you always meet on a given place of the “civil " vehicles in the same configuration that you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a late minute.
What puts in anger they are the situations when you see easily passing the adversary between two cars coming in opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you need is to put themselves on side and the conturner or to slow down.
It is equal if you go ahead of him because it “is calculated " in such way that for the situation given it arrives always very close to your nose.
The adversaries still have other advantages.
During all the time of the play, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same adversary which precedes you at the same place.
That irritates more at the end of the play when you roll on a long bridge in opposite direction.
The adversary must pass at all costs in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hiding place you the sight of the other vehicles in opposite direction and you enter in collision a good amount of times.
One can understand that the goal of this play is to do something of captivating and full with adrédaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And it is damage because through a simple model of control the play is interesting and the places with so much of action than you do not have time to follow all that occurs.
And it is equal if it is because of concept of 50 single routes, that the order of the races is such as it does not have no chance there to be bored or something of other.
The original idea is the change of car during races.
You must pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change there car however most of the time that which you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sport scars are ideal for the cities, the American big-engined cars for the right highways and the super sport scars with the exotic attire on the very technical conduits for example on the roads in lace in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of the adventure, goes very well with the principal mode of the history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experiment which are added to your profile which is common to the challenges and the adventure.
When you reached more the high level of driver, various objects start to be unbolted:
This one is connected on-line with the Autolog function which inter alia compares your results got with those of other players and other functions in the community get to you.
One of the blows most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the subway (that resembles) where you roll in the darkness on the ways (that resembles).
Your speedometer shows to you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you arrive a subway train which sends the car to you directly with scrap.
With the drafting we had a discussion during a few days with knowing if somebody really reflected during the creation of this play or if the authors really take to us for imbeciles.
The technical part of the play is not extra, but the visual part is in general pleasant and in certain really super cases.
What obstructs it is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in certain cases in a tragic way.
That relates to especially the accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is not useful to you any more with nothing.
The sound part is good and the track is with the choice.
With an aim of liking greatest number and particularly more the young public a new sound track was created in the style “I mix all”, but one can expect that nobody will buy the play for the music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Run is thus really confused.
If the play did not have these stupid errors we could say without fear which it is the best production of NFS these last years.
But this play gives the impression not to be finished.
The recreation is really well but prepare so that the faults type you in the eyes with the force of reflectors of aerodrome.

Vicenova, Ambassadress close the Union européeenne:
The Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
“The treaty of Lisbon radically removed balance between the institutions”
“I did not expect such a hard war”.
“That will last 5.6 years before the situation is calmed and that all the players are accustomed to their new role”, thus Miléna Vicenova began its talk with the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassadress close the European Union.
When it succeeded in describing the various bodies of the EU and their relations in a so comprehensible and visible way, so much so that a large number of lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the University Charles could envy it, it showed at which point it takes her motto “comprehensible and openly in connection with Europe " very with the serious one.
Mrs Vicenova paid homage to the work of Hermann Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“As of the beginning criticisms resounded which it is insipid, that it is a pen-pusher, that it cannot fill no mission and I must say that it cut the breath to everyone because it holds his role to perfection”.
“It is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take Europe”.
She explained the new post office of High representing for the foreign affairs and the defense policy within the framework of an answer to the question: “Which is which with the European Union?” “With which phone number do I have to call? ”, therefore like an important step towards the unicity and a greater legibility of the policy of the Union vis-a-vis the states, as is China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky to us (cooked cheese which feels very extremely)
Mrs Vicenova mentioned also diary that lived, saw and will live in a short while the European Council.
It qualified the Czech presidency of two years ago of success.
Czech solved the rising financial crisis, the crisis of gas or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It qualified the fall of gourvernement of very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation at the EU is in this moment very occupied.
According to the words of Madam the Ambassadress, “the activity beat full sound " not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which continues to be solved still now.
It is moreover necessary to approve the new budget septimal Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be mean and for economies, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped more, less, all is to be solved within the framework as of future negotiations.
Madam the Ambassadress pointed out her slogans with which it arrived at Brussels “For comprehensible Europe”.
“I really do not like the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen who must understand it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted gherkins, differently large bananas or although nobody prohibited to us to make syrecky”.
She wants to better use the environment of the EU and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.
Europe at several speeds expects us
According to the Ambassadress the Czechs have the reputation to be Eurosceptics and people who see the things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover it is sorry to see a so small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault results, according to it, several factors, such as for example the timidity of our candidates, their incapacity to write a covering letter and a weak support of the Czech part.
In addition to a Czech presidency with success it then underlined the force and the co-operation of the Visegrad countries.
“Believe me, when towards me the Pole comes, the Magyar, the Slovak one, this French tells me: 'Hé, that estce that you do make over there, which still these Visegrad countries make? “and it is not at all content”.
According to Mrs Vicenova, in a near future in fact hard new rules as regards budget policy expect the member countries.
It is the concept of two-speed Europe, if it is not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a “new European Federation”.
“We have countries in the euro zone and others out of the zone.”
“We have space Schengen, we also have the institute of closer cooperation”.
Initially it was known as that between them the countries cooperate which want it and those which do not wish it remain in their corner.”
“There will be many institutes of this type and there will be really two-speed Europe”, expects Mrs Vicenova.
From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Hermann Van Rompuye to determine the bases according to which all the topics having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not only the memebres of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of his existence
If somebody were to seek the term which expresses with more close the IBM strategy, nearest would be “the long run”.
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt like very current and however since its creation it ran out hundred years.
The base of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first chief of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
It left this slogan which a large number of world problems can be regulated for little that people are eager to reflect.
Its slogan “PENSE'! “became the print around which will develop the life of a future giant (and as the title of the internal magazine as IBM started to publish in 1935).
It was the base of the culture of the company soignement worked out by Watson.
For us IBM means long-term thought of continuous motions directed towards the future.
IBM survived hundred years thanks to the fact that it remained always faithful to its basic values and however was not afraid to change all the others around it.
That enabled us during our first century to transform technology, the business and the company.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more " délaré for the birthday the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the Thirties, put himself to deal with his employees as Bata as a Czech Republic - people of IBM were among the first American employees to only have the paid vacancies, an insurance paid by the employer plus a uniform of elegant employee and a quite elaborate system of rewards for the inventors and the commercial ones.
In the same way IBM has a sytème of relations with the quite elaborate customer.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talents like one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy since it will be a woman Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano in charge of IBM.
This one has worked at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the post of head as the Sales, Marketing and of the Strategy.
IBM during last years does what one calls of the jamy, of the brain- storming on line from what are resulting much from future strategies and the innovations.
It is not astonishing that it has many ideas - in the firm there is nearly 500000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image company which ensure to him a sure position in the fields of the business.
“Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather of institution that of a technological firm”, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of economy at the School of saving in Harvard and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technlogic firm but a firm which helps to solve problems of the world of the business by using its technology”, added Geogre Colony of the firm of Consulting Forrester Research.
As known as the firm itself there is a difference between entering on the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the “Sea”, as it is called familiarly in the United States in view of its slogan in hundred years it grew until becoming one of largest world firms the.
It is obviously the technological firm most general-purpose - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, lodging, consulting services on the level of the products of the waiter until the nanotechnology.
It has many patents of all the American technological firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries lines up for example the automatic teller machine, the purchasing card, the financial swap, the code bar or the diskette.
IBM found this year with 220 billion dollars the second larger firm technological according to the capitalization of the market (first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.
Seen in advance
They are not all the innovations and manufacturing which had the preference of the customer and the time - IBM for example did not make a success of the bet on an operational system proper OS/2, Prodige service in line or of the computer IBM PCjr:
“From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot emotionally remain hung on the past, “points out Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM does not have a problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not function it goes from there.
With the difference for example of Microsoft conccurent which at the base are held and remained under the operational system Windows.
A perspective technology
In the incomes IBM, the services, which are formed for a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a dominating place.
However still in 1990 it with was more motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM sold credits with poor yield for 15 billion dollars, during cettre period it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues in investments and even starting from 2008, when for the first time it exceeded the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased his volume of investments.
Does it appear from now on that IBM passes the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action progessé starting from 2008 in the rocket of 120 pourcent, the net earning of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change all but not its values.
One can expect for that this flexible giant controls other crises.
History of IBM: From the cheese slices until the flights in cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York hundred years ago\; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was about a mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and in South America.
The base of future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is related to the Eighty of the ten ninth century.
They had technologies such as for example old the “pointer ones”, the pendulums which recorded the arrival and the departure of the employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory board of the company.
Flint engaged the chief of a concurrent firm Thomas J. Watson to help it to direct the company.
The leader overshadowed then the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that rest until now the identity and the culture of the company.
Watson directed the firm kusqu' in 1952.
IBM, like says it its name, started with the production of all the possible machines for the business and the trade - meat and cheese slicers to the cash registers.
During the first four years during which Watson directed, the turnover multiplied until reaching 9 million dollars and began the expansion of the firm in all the parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of direction it is his/her son who occupied the armchair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the Sixties people and the computers of IBM helped NASA has to guide the flights in cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM System/360.
The traditional PC which determined the standard of computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its factory of computers at the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started to deal with council and services with high added value.
The strategy which succeeds at IBM these three last years - is the concept Smarter Planet “a more intelligent planet”.
Its objective is the intelligent uilisation of technology in fields not yet exploited such as for example the transport and the management of the cities.
As regards the field the IBM commercial developed little time ago a platform “Smarter Commerce " which helps the commercial ones to manage all the commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first Central European country and Eastern.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic center of outsourcing of Brno.
The Power station for the Central and Eastern Europe sits at Prague and there are also the research team and development of the world level which deals with the voice recognition.
Rychtarova in connection with his/her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I do not want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it is finished!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) becomes bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph awakes of his pink dream and returns to the house.
Only it could not wait and laid down clear rules for the future life.
“Pepa can return to the house, but not as my partner " explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in its house, she did not suspect that its couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move of Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he acknowledged in public that he liked it.
With Darina time resigned, accepted the connection of his/her husband and finished by him saying good-bye for always.
Rychtirova is not interested of knowing with which her husband sleeps.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to accommodate it on the step of the door of the house.
“It is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, nobody will put it outside”.
“It will not be any more my old loved and lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a particular relation”, let filter Rychtarova by showing that it was detached from her husband but who they remain only in one decent relation.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect the decision of my wife”.
“I will remain with Iveta and will not change”.
“My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect it”.
“The company continues, I occupy itself of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy”.
“With Darina one discusses in a completely normal way but we do not sleep together " declared Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it will not prevent it.
“We do not sleep together and it does not interest me of knowing where it goes, with which and if it has a connection.
I know that it is my fault, I fell in love D " Iveta and I take on me all responsibility”, Joseph concluded.
Worst defects of the women: Does that concern you too?
If you ask the men to determine typical defects of the women, all, the ones like the others, are able to leave them “their handle”.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female defects which manage to pump the blood of the veins of the men.
Purchases
Does your half pass remarks to you that you are dependant on the purchases?
Have to buy at least a clothing per week to you?
Are you glad to buy and per packages at the time as of balances?
In your case one can speak about the purchases like a defect.
Certain women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But will you say, which would resist the window shopping clothes shops, to seek for oneself of pretty clothing and then to test them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, that can become for the man a true hell.
Recall only how much time have thinks to your spouse that it waits at the entry…
Constant dissatisfaction
“Amn't I too large”?
“I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilos - I should start to do sports?”
“You like Me?”
Don't these sentences point out something to you?
Yes?
You thus belong to these women who are obsessed by their appearance.
It is not the question which should cease to you occupying you of yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more the women become poisoning.
The odre and cleanliness in the first place
It is like an infinite horse-gear.
To wash the windows, to pass the vacuum cleaner, to clean the grounds, to make dust, to pickle the bathroom - and that twice per week.
Do you pass remarks with your partner whom it goes with dirty feet on the clean ground, with the children that they dirtied the wash-hand basin, clogged the pane of the living room, and that gives you much work?
If you precisely suffer from this obsession, try to have with the spirit which should not anything be exaggerated and which the order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This inoffensive desire of cleanliness can however waste your relations and even family peace.
Sabotage
“Met this track suit used with the dustbin”.
“You intend to put these old socks still tomorrow?”
“A wet towel does not have anything to make by ground”.
If you make on your partner this sabotage in this way several times per day, you really will break up it.
It is obvious that you do not think of evil you want that all is impeccable.
Perhaps that if the men knew it, the women would not have to do such an amount of sabotage…
Defamation, mockery
Defamation, the mockery but also the insults against somebody is also clean certain women.
The women are carried particularly to the relations and thus are glad to cover issues like which, where, with which, how and why.
Perhaps that each one of us lets escape a small inoffensive mockery here and there.
The hand on the heart it is however a characteristic of the women.
But the worst is those which advise, deride, even scorns the others and is for their entourage - particularly with work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker hokeyist Jagr took part by twice in the victory of Philadelphia during the match of Monday NHL over the ice of Caroline and is again at the top of the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of the 39 year old star Claude Giroux, who made still a master key moreover and was appointed the best player of the match, it marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match declared with the journalists of on the other side of the Atlantic whom he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
“I told him before the match that it would give its hat-trick”.
“I felt it”.
“Some time this feeling falls you above " explained Jagr after its Giroux action marked a goal of the first shooting of Flyers.
One moment later there was a second attack of the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the metal disc and presented it to the striker Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first pause, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In co-operation with Jagr it marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I adore to play with him”.
“I do not want to say that he is the best player of the league but it belongs really to three the best”, declared Jagr in connection with its center.
“I had never thought that I would play in the end of a career with a hokeyjist like him”.
“I am really content with that”.
“I want to play on him”.
“All these years at the NHL the other players of the team tried to play on me, maintaining it is my turn”, Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a shooting of penalty it finishes with a difference in a goal.
Matt Read did not draw aside from other complications which finished to two against one.
“Pronger carried out excellent attacks in our zone”.
“It typed on the metal disc, I took speed and (Read) left towards the corner furthest away from the cage.
“I tried to strike it and I arrived there”, described the last goal of the match from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the top of the Conference of the East.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo it left in second third because of a wound in the upper part of the body.
Candiens were not due vis-a-vis a defender experienced their advance of two butset lost after a shooting of penalty by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the line postpones was sick which especially annoyed the local trainer rather than of the lost poins because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
“It is null”.
“We played the match only with one experienced player, the remainder they were young people”.
“But there is nothing to make, it is like that”, known as Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement that does not have is enough and we could not resist”.
“We had just to simplify the play, to push the metal disc out of our zone”.
For that we had limits, “added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender taken share with the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 various gunners took part uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 matches lost.
How the prices of the voyages evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at that time especially proposed voyages in the countries of the socialist block, because the voyages to the west were very limited.
The Czech tourists travelled for the vacancies to East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, the Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both at sea Noire) and in Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel to Yugoslavia then the mode started to have an inclination for the west and the voyages towards Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist time was that it nétait not authorized for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakian ones) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Tchécoslovaque citizen wanted to travel individually for example to Poland or Soviet Union it needed an invitation letter if not the individual voyage was not authorized.
The travel agencies at that time however offered also voyages to the West it was necessary to make the tail all the night with a bag of bed or to have a “good knowledge " within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not gained yet.
The agreement for the currencies which was the condition to travel to the west was refused with “politically incorrect " people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not however exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs generally spent their vacancies in the country where there were consequently many country cottage and country houses which the Czechs bought and this practice lasts until now.
The voyages of the Czechs since knew since 1989 a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the vacancies in East Germany and Bulgaria were to the maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of vacancies in the countries of the whole world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today it is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go because left Yugoslavia of the time freely until 1989.
The removal of the visas in the Nineties of last century in the adjoining countries of the west caused an enormous wave of visits of short time especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakian ones could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that each one wanted to see at least a moment.
For example in Paris the organizations of voyages made sleep the Czechs in tents in the parks because our incomes did not enable us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech voyage was at that time to carry with oneself its own food preserves, sausage, etc… to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after tens of years of freely being able to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wages increased what caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to an increasing demand for the voyages the travel agencies started to since 1997 prepare turns with connections by air charters which thanks to contracts formidably reduced the costs compared to what there was front.
At the end of the Nineties of last century the Czechs had connections without visas with practically most developed countries of the whole world except for HAVE which later facilitated our voyages.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, when the first air charter towards an exotic country was prepared, Thailand, starting from the Czech Republic.
For this year as each year of the direct air charters have taken along Czech tourists in the remote hot countries\; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations starting from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries each year!
Still an interesting moment during this time which symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.
on November 17th, 2008 HAVE the visas for the Czech tourists removed and made it possible our country to completely line up in the group of the developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in the history passed more half of their vacancies abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time still in the history spent more than 15,000 crowns per anybody for vacancies abroad including the additional loads. Crowns by anybody.
The general meeting must find her President but that is likely to end in a situation unresolved “a stalemate”
Close to 5mois already Czech football is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek in charge of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic is not yet known after still a General Assembly which must be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However there still does not exist agreement according to which regulation of vote it is necessary to proceed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the direction of Czech football.
Hasek gave its resignation in June and during its departure called his/her colleagues has to link and find a strong personality which will direct football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football retrogressed worms of the divergences between the rooms of Association which cannot agree on a common candidate.
That completely showed on September 16th when a new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was even no question of treating way of electing.
There no was agreement on the fact of knowing which has the right to vote with the General Assembly - only, seems it, statutory representatives or also invested civils servant of absolute powers.
In this single point there has been an agreement partial for this moment with the assistance also of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the absolute power is not possible.
The divergences always continue concerning the regulation for the election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its negotiation planned or extraordinary, did not bring anything either to the situation
The opinions on the possibilitě of vote changed several times but the sensitive spots remain always the same one.
The question is: how to proceed for the third turn not to fall into the stalemate.
“The bone of contention resides in the following fact: that is to say to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model”, one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda noted who represents professional football within association.
According to the rules of the model envisaged gains with the third turn that of the candidates which will have received the most voice expressed as a percentage within the room for which he is candidate.
Moravie is ready according to what one says to withdraw so that the candidate gains who will have received the greatest percentage of voice of the two rooms.
And the Czech part studies the condition which the winner should have two thirds at least percentages of voice.
“Only that would make then lose the idea of two preceding turns and that would make completely refuse the bicameral concept”, Svoboda admits which understands the objections of the Moravian part and according to which best would be not to change the regulation and to vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising which Tomas Paclik is also agreement even if it estimates that the regulation of the elections established according to the statutes favours more Pelta among all the candidates.
“I wish that one vote to the maximum according to the statutes of association”.
“So that there are no yet absurd ideas imagined by a representative as during General meetings passed”, the owner of Victoria Plzen declared who is candidate for the first time and which in its talks was defined especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk it there will have a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future unit and in a constructive way.
“The possible qualification today in Championship of Europe should calm everyone”.
“Football will be again on a wave of happiness and it aure more spirit for a co-operation " adds there the officer of Jablonec which among the three has greatest experience as regards direction of football as well professional as at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tended”.
“It is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravian ones, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations with drawing”.
“That can cause a blocking in Assemblé again general”.
“I hope all the same that the healthy reason will gain " said Rajchl.
It does not remain much of time for an agreement common to all the parts.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say if all the direction of football will be complete for the match.
The especially chartered flight in which were to travel until Podgorice inter alia the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and one sought an alternative to take along part of the executive committee on the ground of the reprisals.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be determining.
The Minister for the education of youth and the sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parts torn within the strongest sports club of the country and to bring them to an agreement.
In the play there is much: an official equipment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of the Sports which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik from goes away to the combat for the position of president because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the chief of the footballers of Plzen Divided into volumes Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered all that he asks for a new President of the Association of the football of Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put in shift for this high position.
“If such a candidate I exist support it, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election.”
“But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate”, Paclik at the Czech Press agency declared (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to enter competing with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for precisely trying to prevent Pelta from reaching in charge of the AFRT which a priori would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also underlines that if it would gain the elections it would hold this position of president only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high level manager but who is not dependant with the world of football.
“I discussed with people who would have the profile”, he says.
“For me that was terrible when certain told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football in this moment.”
“I would like to make change this image”, he added.
What, one says, obstructs especially Paclik, it is the relation between Pelta and the President of the Regional union of the football of Plzen Roman Berbr, man with the contreversée fame which is known in the slides as lobbyist able to influence the Assembled vote of the delegates 'general one.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President.
“If it gained, the actual position would remain and there would be nothing again in football.”
“And with the support of Berbr, which is commercial of high flight, that would be even less favorable to football”, Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks it is the fact that the name of Pelta was marked it there a few years during listenings within the framework of an investigation on a corruption affair, for which Pelta was left there without any sorrow.
“I do not know which Pelta prestige would bring to football.”
“And how would be us considered with the eyes of the UEFA and of the FIFA " Paclik says, which declared some time ago “if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen”.
If Paclik would triumph with the vote over Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September which had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
“It (Pelta) would be the first with which I would go”.
“He has great ability”
“It would be able to be presented for example in the form of a chief of the representation”.
“But as to manage Association it would not be able.”
“I do not put the nose in what I do not know”, Paclik indicates which in September drew a great attention when he decided for the cancellation of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela which Dagmar Damkova replaced.
Paclik affirms that it would be on the level to direct Association.
It takes as example its capacities to direct private firms and which it also directs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with its support last May its triumph in the first division.
“I have the force to make change something in the world of the sport and to bring a certain culture there”.
“I would slow down the influence of certain interested groups which tend for example to influence the disciplinary Commission and of call, which brings to situations of bad taste”, Paclik added which chache not its antipathy for the chief of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider a harmonization of the relations with the Czech Olympic committee whose power of lobby near the high level policies would make it possible to obtain for the sport more money of the tax on the plays.
“It is one of the key points whose new President should occupy himself”.
“If it is the tax on the games of chance as the political parties declare it, I understand their argumentations but they should also say where the money goes”, he declared.
Paclik does not take its current connection with the club of Plzen as something of negative even if itself affirms that the President of the AFRT should be “above parties”.
Pelta is again dependant with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“It is not the ideal”.
I do not see reason to transmit my actions of the club of Plzen to somebody if I must return one year and half after”, Paclik declared.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the situations of stalemate.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidate to the presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes which should put an end in the future with the quarrels concerning the regulation for the elections.
The civil servant of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday in very optimistic Nymburk and thinks that the success today of the representation of football should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September which was not carried out precisely promised to be devoted to the national representation and obtaining financial means if he is elected.
It decided to be candidate at the last time right before the last General Assembly and this delay of two months could enable him well to defend its vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context.
“People on all the levels make football for a long time and wait until Thursday there is a President”.
“They feel that it is the best moment so that somebody takes over the leadership of Association”, he adds, but he is above all dependant with the club of Jablonec, worked a large number of years in Sparta and the Executive committee of the Union.
it is also for that it has enough experiments to direct Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election an euphoria is which reigned with lépoque of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately with L " Assembled general of June of the statutes were approved which were not perfect as all are seen by it”.
“If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a President since September”, Pelta underlines.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association which took all the attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities for them if that does not go”.
“It is a principle without which we cannot exist”, Pelta added.
Then he makes an effort, one says, not to confront itself with his adversaries.
He declared before that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl which he recognizes in view of his training in right and which he knows pertinently that its adversary-candidate would be its first Vice-president.
It either for a long time did not attack Tonas Paclik which on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
“It has evolved in football for one year and already had some successes.”
“Its attacks were however not more honourable and has surprised many people during the countryside.”
“It is also for that some now have doubts about its character”, Pelta intended for its adversary declared but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations that it made in September.
Its strongest weapon is according to him its knowledge of football starting from the competitions of low the level until the national representation.
It should be a vitirne of football.
“And I would also endeavor to finish all the business which starts with that of Bohémians or the continuation of the corruption scandal.”
“I would enter immediately into negotiations with the public sector and private so that we can obtain enough money for all football”, declared at Czech Press agency CTK the 46ème candidate two months ago.
He as added as its nomination in charge of football would not bring any change of people.
“I should make knowledge with all the employees”, he declared in Strahov where reign a comprehensible nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios envisaged with the General Assembly, it thinks that the delegates will not go in Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is only one point of discord on the way of voting with the third turn we will be able to exceed it”.
“Football needs credibility and it will obtain it only when there is at its head a new leader”, as declares it in an optimistic way Pelta two days before the probably determining day for its career of civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under its direction the AFRT would start to work hard
“If Jindrich Rajchl are elected new President of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic with L " General Assembly of Thursday that would not like the current Vice-president a large number of people, it appears.
Rajchl promises however that if he would be elected one starts to work hard.
He wants changes systemic and to return the members of the Executive committee are responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to regulate the Bohémians business, to improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, to bring to football more money and to continue the work started with the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As President I want to deal with football in his entirety”.
“International contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA through the national representation, of professional football and a powerful football for youth.”
“But I do not only say that I will make all that " said Rajchl in a maintenance for CTK.
“I am a player of team and want to distribute competences within the Executive committee so that each member deals with given field.”
“And I will distribute difficult missions so that football face a great step ahead”.
“Much of people will not be content because it will be a question of starting to work hard rather than to criticize the others " he added.
It mentioned, it is said, that it would not be represented like candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“In connection with me, one knows that I work 20 hours per day.”
“but I need to know if that is worth the blow and if I have people behind me who will unceasingly put sticks in the wheels to me and will express doubts on each one as of the my actions”, explaining why he hesitated.
“Much of people said me all the same that I should not give up because they would also give up”.
“It is a confidence which I cannot betray”, he says.
What justifies it, one says, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“For these two last years there has been a great work in fact and I do not want to drop it”.
“There are processes which were launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like that somebody stops them. ', he declared with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in a systematic work and it is a thing which Mirek Pelta cannot make”.
“Behind him people are who fairaient football in such a way that it would be only for those which were selected”.
“One can reproach me a certain number of things but not to surely support quelq' one”.
“I endeavour to be objective”.
“I want to make football for all because everyone will be content step only those which were selected
And it confirms again that he would be only one President for Tchéquie.
“And if there are some who say the opposite, I am ready to do the utmost for Moravie”.
“For example, it is the time to consider which the second division is divided into two parts one Czech and the other Moravian one of which the winners would find themselves in the first division.”
“There would be no situation as currently with only three team Moravian in division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Divided into volumes Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of president, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances to gain.
“I permanently feel a support of the Czech Room which elected me its Vice-president and knows that with me there will be successes”, Rajchl declared which plans among its future successes to save tens of million crowns on detrimental contracts, negotiations of contracts with televisions and on the law on the plays.
He says on the contrary which the fact that Association is not plain is a fault common to all.
Whereas he says in connection with Pelta “that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose its credibility”, he thinks that the second Paclik adversary is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
“Nobody can question at Plzen which it made this year a superb work”.
“If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started with Hasek and would not make notable change among the people in the Commissions.”
“He would not like to waste his successes " said Rajchl which has evaluated his rivals.
Most beautiful swimming pools of Europe
A jump in blue
De Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in optics of UFO, splendid swimming pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having turned the city or goes for a long walk can let put back his legs tired in aerated water baths.
A book shows in which basin of swimming one can experiment the most wellbeing.
When Iris Meder went on a journey of research during the last 18 months, there is an object which should not miss in its luggage: its bathing suit.
Extended on its back in water, it observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles which expected it on the other side of the swimming pool and did not fail to admire the Art nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased him, it noted in its notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were probed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and it presented them in its book already published: “Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath”. Municipal covered swimming pools of Munich, historical palates of bath in the black forest, “concrete Hardware buildings - core” in Taunus.
It led its “voyages to the most exceptional baths of the Central Europe” in 13 country. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she respectively visited places in Italy, France, Tchéquie, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 years German is true enthusiastic of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains why it does not have much interest for the sport but ell feels attracted with the water in a completely different way.
It is irritating which the supporteurs of swimming must be satisfied to contemplate blue squares and to put up themselves with the stink of bleach while the jogging shoes breathe of the perfume bewitching of the forests of spruce or can listen to chirp of merry birds of the park.
“I wondered one day why the swimming pools must in fact being always so ugly” said the Viennese.
“I thus began a collection of beautiful baths.”
Water surface reinforces architecture doubly
A diving in a swimming pool and volatile oils of sauna - factor of wellbeing in the rooms of swimming are enormous because all the directions are waked up, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have tried hard a little more, the rooms to swim could be a sheer delight for the eyes: “Instead of a floor there is a water surface in the rooms of swimming.”
“It is on a side transparent, but however reflects on another side the beauty of the entire building.”
All surfaces arise double way optically: high vaults, multicoloured squares, springboards.
The volume of image of small size “Badefreuden” submits a report worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of the historical wellbeing - it gives certainly desire for making a jump in blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable specimens during its research in Hungary.
Beside the splendid baths of wellbeing like the Széchenyi bath 100 years old in Budapest, it found water containing of nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (bath of cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths of which the basins are filled with water containing of alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and being in a building in the shape of bottle.
On the other hand, the swimming pools heated in the open air of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular sights. While of a roof of the bath of Zurich there is all the city in his eyes, one can admire Arlberg covered with snow starting from a swimming pool external of St Anton: The Turkish bath is provided with a window from which one can observe animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design of the swimming pool expects the swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an UFO which has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, vapor rises of the three opened plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
the odor of bleach does not emanate from all the swimming pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur odor, from Árpád-spa in Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong oil odor, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a spa health.
The odor comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to you with the skin as soon as you let yourselves slip into the swimming pool - a special experiment of spa.
During its search of beautiful the swimming pools, Iris Meder also underwent disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free swimming pool external and in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded ground.
The bath conceived by architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed meanwhile.
By throwing a glance by the window of New building-Art in red-white-yellow, it observed the blooming of weeds between the squares.
It observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palate of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building already survived three phases\; one can discover not only elements néo-Romans which leave since its design in 1844 but still a room Moor in Alhambra style which was added to him in 1900.
Since its careful modernization of 1995, the thermal palate remains the favorite bath of expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originating in Schwarzwald.
“It is already a beautiful output which to melt so different styles of construction in a so formidable unit”, known as Meder.
With such a palate, the diving in the thermal swimming pool is apparently only one minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in details the speculation on the raw material
Of Christian Teevs
German gives up does its bank it speculation on the raw materials?
According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann charged a working group with seeking the consequences of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the chief of the group wants to then draw some from the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans find unacceptable that the banks speculate in the raw materials like corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the questioned people even require that the German bank and other institutes of credit stop this avenue of business because it increases the problems of poorest world.
It is the result of a Forsa investigation on the order of the organization of the Foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on the total raw materials, pushes the prices to the top and that the banks share a complicity with the world famine.
The protection campaign of consumers is aligned concretely against the chief of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
The speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect the merchants against the price fluctuations.
But the majority of the experts share the opinion meanwhile that the punters were detached from supply and demand - and benefit the expenses from very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently of the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and known as, “no business is worth the sorrow to bring into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group currently examines the charges of Foodwatch-Carryforward.
The examination must be finished from here the end of the year, then the conclusions reached by the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the chief of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
It could result a reduction from it from the market of the raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
The chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode greeted the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms towards the financial sector: “The speculation on the rise in prices of the foodstuffs shows in a particularly Draconian way, which point the banks of today harm the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby with being today particularly under obligation.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all the placements of its wallet, for which money was invested on the food speculations” declared Bode.
“That imports little, for Mr Ackermann, if it is question of famished people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is concerned.”
The awakening of Ackermann can appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the chairman of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving its functions.
Deutsche Bank made announce Monday that the president of the Board of directors will not change anything with what is envisaged within the Board of directors.
Ll could improve its brand image with an abandonment of the discussed agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, it has to hardly be concerned with it - its successor will be worried some.
One on two would cancel the placements on the raw materials.
Foodwatch endeavours to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
Until now more than 30,000 Net surfers already took part in the countryside of the organization.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which November 7th and 8th the Forsa Institute carried out questionnaires near 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found that legitimates that Deutsche Bank proposes placements for which bets on the prices of the food substances are made.
Many customers of the bank would also draw some from the personal consequences if they learned that their bank takes part in such operations: one on two would cancel, following the survey, all the placements for which money is injected into the speculations on the raw materials.
43 percent would disadvise of such a bank to their entourage, 49% answered that they would think of the cancellation of their account to change D” banking institution.
21st house in Vienna
The House which moved
D' Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and Happy End: the Austrian house for the world exposures of Brussels in 1958 gained prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty then fell in ruin.
Now it is again opened and holds place of house of exposure.
If one is filled with enthusiasm for a modern architecture of post-war period, for his forms clear, his hangars out of glass, his paces sharp and daring and his new building materials which are typical belief towards technical progress, then the house of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the World Fair of Brussels in 1958 in is a good and famous example.
The House of Schwanzer formerly accepted the “Grand Prix of Architecture” for its construction steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is regarded until our days as a big step in the contemporary architecture.
It made the architects so famous, whom it also built the House for the following Austrian World Fair.
With its legendary house with four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in the shape of bowl in Munich, it finally became famous with the international level in 1973.
Its project of house as a temporary construction had been exposed after the World Fair in the Swiss Garden to the station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building neither nor technically was physically adapted for a museum - not of walls to hang works of art, therefore not a good environment.
However it was used also a long time, jusqu " so that the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and was dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the House, he now is called after “House of the 21st century” and will in the future be used like museum for the contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exposure - a stroke of luck to any point of view.
The new departure was concluded by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted a historian of art to a considerable career amongst other things in its youth of artistic skater, thereafter at Sotheby' S, with the museum Guggenheim and as a direct founder of the museum of the modern art of Salzburg, she undertook particularly to good the alterations near the politicians and from the protection of the monuments, she obtained public funds and of sponsoring private and the exploitation established some.
Except the contemporary art, works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation carries the same name were exposed there, a coffee and a bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was thus the ideal interpreter.
Not only because it had transformed and widened with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had gained the contest, but because it had studied at the technical University of Vienna and that for him the house was “an extremely important place” place where it had seen “practically each weekend” the exposures.
He knew the project of origin, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following its displacement in Vienna and from its change of use.
At the time of the current transformations, there were big problems: L " building was “a pit in energy”, known as Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows of the frontages out of glass were changed, of glass insulating reinforced out of glass fibers was posed and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of the cold bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with asbestos were rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new exploitation, a panel of light filtered between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entry - it is almost a new construction, but always light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The doors external of origins remained, the house is painted in a color rust protection of color red-brown.
And the cinema is even exactly identical so that it was formerly.
And all that under narrow monitoring of the competent jurisdictions for the monuments and with a small budget.
“Often of the materials which are good and not very expensive were to be found, and which also likes the office of protection monuments”, said Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in basement.
Despite everything the constraints, the problems and the transformations, L " building remained flexible and light.
That would have been difficult with the House, “which came from Brussels”, said Krischanitz recently, a typical history of “Drop-in-tea-City”.
Such an architecture is “always at the bad place” and wants despite everything “to wake up the clear conscience”.
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not at the bad place, because if it is at a stretch about chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden precisely draws up the “district of the central station” all lately envisaged, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck perhaps will occur: the House of the 21st century could profit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the center of Berliner temporary art, and like he says himself, she already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a fixed price crisis of winter in million.
The company of the railroads worked out a plan-crisis, which aims at avoiding the accidents of train in winter.
The number of paid should double.
That costs million.
In the combat against the accidents of train related to the season of winter and the delays, the company of the railroads “Deutsche Bahn” will spend in this respect more than 70 additional million this year.
The daily newspaper “Bild” - Zeitung reported as a preliminary by calling upon an internal plan-crisis to the group, that investments of a total of approximately 300 million euros would be envisaged until 2015.
That should allow a better availability of the vehicles and railway network also in the case of extreme bad weather.
The number of paid interns and external for the snow clearance of the railway installations and the quays should amongst other things double and pass to 16,000 people.
The objective is to remove the quays of snow and the ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of the trackside equipment necessary to the service within a period of four to five hours.
There is two months the Rüdiger Grube Stationmaster warned the government and industry at the time of a summit of the accidents of trains which have occurred also this winter.
Last winter the company of the railroads had enormously problems for transport D” users, because it misses reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions amongst other things.
Thus many new regional trains expect since years an authorization on behalf of the Ministry for the railroads.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of trains ICE.
The company of railroad has since years what to make, since it must make definitely more often check the axles of trains ICE to the workshop, after a broken axle took place on a ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank “Deutsche Bank” pays million penalties in the USA.
After the business of the chief Josef Ackermann there is the new one in the USA: the German bank “Deutsche Bank” must pay a fine S " raising to million.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with it in more in the USA: the institute of Frankfurt pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a disagreement because of the bankruptcy of five co-operative large banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of documents of mortgage.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA carries to the large banks all a series of charges, and it to have to encourage the cooperative banks to make empty promises concerning the product purchase financial\; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents enormously lost value during the financial crisis and involved the banks downwards.
“We are satisfied, to have been able to find a solution on this subject, without the parts setting in motion a procedure with the court”, an interlocutor of Deutsche Bank said to New York.
The Bank did not recognize in comparison any fault.
That is valid also for Citigroup, which engaged with a payment of an amount of 20.5 million dollars.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz accommodated the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for the cooperative banks of the USA and it intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits from customers.
The NCUA tries to repair the incurred damage several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks with part and in summer it assigned before the Court JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the question of the documents of mortgage it is about “Mortgage-backed Securities”.
The houses of credit are at the base.
When the American real estate bubble burst in 2007, This was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the investment bank of the USA Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events go back already to a few years, at present it blows on the US banks a wind of storm.
The investors and the authorities of monitoring brought many case to obtain repair or to sanction failures.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) started the largest wave of complaints.
It reproaches at 18 international large banks, with the two financial ones of the real estate D " state American Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of S " being favoured in kind at the time of business of mortgages of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank must also lodge a recourse with the FHFA, it acts here of several operations of a full amount of 14.2 billion dollars for the years 2005 to 2007.
The authorities of monitoring require, that Frankfurter answer of the “substantial losses” but however without quoting a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had refused the applications as being unjustified and states to want to defend oneself.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal sums in the company TI of IBM.
Since March, it bought actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
Up to that point the large US investor Warren Buffett unceasingly explains not to invest in data-processing companies TI, considering L " evolution long-term of the companies let appear only bad forecasts.
It however read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investments in this sector.
It had already to understand much earlier than IBM proposes especially performances of service and computer systems for the sectors TI of other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is regarded as an attack of knight in the financial world.
Consequently the activity TI IBM grants the right to be called now “Mr IBM”.
Because Buffett revealed today with L " economic emission CNBC, which it bought since March of the IBM actions of a value of 10.7 billion dollars.
Its holding company of Berkshire Hathaway investment thus became a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM never knew anything of this commitment up to now.
He congratulated the direction, which even during the economic crisis had ensured of the reasonable benefit.
“You made a super job”, Buffett said strategically.
IBM for some time put on the lucrative services TI in so much qu” exploitation of the countable centers.
The pioneer of data processing, old man of more than 100 years, offers Software and consultation as well that very powerful calculators of company.
Buffett had until now rather avoided the companies of technology.
He says that he invests only in the companies of which he understands the business.
But on the contrary Buffett attacks rather with the railway freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares near a whole series of great groups like Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the ex Rück of Munich.
This 81 year old octogenarian had included in the Sixties” the small company of textile Berkshire Hathaway and had set up it with the row of the one of the most prestigious world companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However its lifestyle is modest.
Therefore it is a cult figure for many investors of the whole world.
Its almost infallible direction to earn money was worth to him the nickname of “Oracle d' Omaha”.
After the announcement of the investment of Buffett the IBM actions increased by a percent to the purse.
“Big Blue”, such as names also IBM, has a quoted value of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and account with Apple and Microsoft among the most invaluable companies technology in the world.
At Microsoft, known as Buffett, it does not want to take part in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be very a good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the “cell of Zwickauer” the media Turkish doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks even about a “bloody ideology”, which reappears now.
The assassinations of eight nationals Turkish and a Greek small company in the years 2000 to 2006 had a context extremist.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the germano-Turkish population reacts with fear and concern.
Because for much of germano-Turkish the spectrum which one believed for a long time dead remade his appearance: since the attacks flamers of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there more was comparable violence in this context extremist of right-hand side against the Turks.
That there is in Germany a xenophobia, it was however never question.
The network extremist of right-hand side which was detected reveals however proportions whose dimension is far from being foreseeable.
“This Is a return to the bloody ideology”, “Such was the title of the publication on Internet of the Turkish daily newspaper “Haberturk”.
The newspaper “Sabah” underlines on the other hand that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries owing to the fact that the German authorities could be implied in the mud pit of far right.
It is in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend with a quiet commemoration with the racial victims of violence in front of the door of Brandebourg.
They are only two weeks before that the Turkish community of Berlin and the German policies and Turkish had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the agreement of recruitment germano-Turkish.
It is with merry colors that the cohabitation had been production, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of certain media Turkish make the effect of a slap: “the gift of Germany for the fiftieth birthday” such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform “Haber X”, which refers to the context of the murder series.
Also the German publication of the “Hürriyet” is not deprived to draw some from the univocal conditions.
“that starts to stink”, Such is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses there that people would have been assassinated, would have paid taxes and would have made by their work an important contribution to the rebuilding of Germany.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the forums germano-Turkish and those had discussed success of their research thereafter.
Why the weather did not already come much earlier to mind from the German authorities to be research in certain suspect mediums of far right, the authors are astonished.
More one is ready at least with average even drastic rhetorics: “If the business continues to be skimped on, it will remain with the migrants anything else only the self-defense and the armament”.
“that will be well the best self-defense”.
“Interior peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and the relevance on the punishment of the whole of the network”, writing “Selen”.
What that means if interior peace in Germany east in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the Nineties explained well.
The photograph of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks more clearly living here than there is a tangible threat, and with the Germans, to what mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks however sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never not to repeat the errors of the past
Formerly it is especially the failure of the German policy after the attacks about which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen it sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was made represent with the funeral in Cologne by its Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in its speech, how much taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the amount of its fiscal charges.
The current report of the media Turkish shows once more how much the mistrust much of Germano-Turkish is deep towards L " rule of law local since this date.
In addition to the efforts of a fuller explanation and revaluation of the terrorism of far right in Germany, a clear message is this time necessary.
The bank with scandal of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went bankrupt in the financial crisis almost and patinates meanwhile from one crisis to another.
It is a German who must direct now.
It is certainly not what Axel Weber S " was imagined.
After its spectacular departure of the head of Bundesbank\; one was informed in July, which it would occupy in 2013 station almost such a spectacular: President of the Board of directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, greeted\; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its solidity recently obtained and made pass from pleasant observations on the future colleagues.
“UBS made a success of Turnaround”.
“I am delighted by collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel”.
And yet, as of September it was clear that all was going to change.
A merchant of titles of UBS to London had diverted all the security systems of the Bank and had flamed approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The chief of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the President of the board of directors of UBS is regarded since as suffering - and all require: When Axel Weber does it return finally?
We already learned that Weber can be advised starting from February 2012 bank.
And it will take again the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, like the bank communicated Tuesday.
For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.
It is not banking, much more professor D " economy and President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed one period of adaptation.
At a stretch he then assumes the responsibility for the strategy for a bank, which has just proven once again moreover than it for a long time deserved the title of “more the large bank with scandal of Europe”.
Indeed, UBS is on an enormous side - until recently, it was the largest manager of credits of the world, and other, it patinates since years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, saves to it so proud Swiss bank.
That started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss manager of credits, silencer and solid, but also crafty one, it had combined it with ambitious objectives: she wanted to also become, in the field of the banking investment, very a large bank.
Thus UBS managed on a side in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more money coming from easy customers than very other banks in the world.
In addition, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the more large banks of the world.
That made impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of bank during long years in Zurich tell: “I always took UBS as model of good bank in front of my students.”
“In current optics, one wonders: how I could quite simply have misled me at this point?”
It deeply was mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn out badly to UBS.
In the middle of the year president Peter Wuffli withdrew himself in a surprising way, which was regarded up to that point as a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later one had a presentiment of for which reasons it had left.
The division of the bank had flamed with documents sub-bonus and has to make a cross on billion.
To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital growth of an amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.
For that it actually found investors, but who, little front time, would have wrinkled the eyebrows: an Asian government stock not-transparency coming from Singapore and an Arab government stock, which had overlooked, so much so that one even never learned its name.
That N " was however that the first blow.
In April 2008 that was worsened.
The bank was to announce losses again amounting to billion, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, which was still in 2006 the second board of directors best paid of Switzerland, was withdrawn.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: UBS was, taking into account its errors of investment, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State.
The national bank repurchased in the UBS of tens of billion titles problematic, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds in actions, for which it could become joint owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was shaken - because it noted at which point that can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter of if large banks.
Lastly, the total of the assessment of UBS 2007 S " raised with more than five times the economic performances of Switzerland (see graphic).
“We could not save UBS once again”, said the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first catastrophe it was followed from there by the second.
Already a few front months, UBS had capitulated because of a tax disagreement with America and was declared ready to publish the data of the easy customers, which had defrauded the tax department perhaps with the assistance of the Bank.
Moreover, it accepted a payment of 780 million dollars - in refunding of unjustified benefit coming from these operations with a raised fine.
Thus UBS more or less published that it had helped with the tax evasion.
At the same time it lost something which was always its capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secrecy was not the same one any more.
It followed from there withdrawal of the chief of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And of the exodus of the money of the customers.
Thus the bank had lost in a few months its credibility in the two principal sectors of business: the banking investment because of bad speculations and the management of credits because of the assistance with the tax evasion.
And, as there was somewhat a return to a state of calm, and as it was thought, than UBS would be left there, it followed from there this unhappy history of merchants of title: only one merchant of title flames 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something did not turn out badly.
And one publishes: with the risk management in investment bank that still does not seem to function.
“With the case Adoboli, one could note that the control of the risks with too little changed”, said Martin Jansen, economist and professor of finances at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the finance director of a German large bank in is sure: “the problem of UBS is that she does not hold the control of the risks.”
However it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had for a long time taken their function, that to become guard of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but safety for the money - and the world could crumble well beyond the alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of a steadfast reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli is it for a particularly noble chocolate.
The power station of UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the stereotyped solid of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is traditional.
The Bank has its seat at the central station of Zurich, which directly leads central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-covered tops of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of stores appear among highest of Europe.
The jewellers like Tiffany' S, one finds them here between the stores of Swiss traditions just like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
Since centuries of the Swiss bankers resided here: national bank via the palate of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
One arrives in the hall of UBS by a door carries.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of are thick chairs of leather, and beside the logo of the bank, a large label for “safe”.
UBS knows what the customer seeks here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other isolated of the market - or betrayed the two Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the chief of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all the Swiss bankers he also gets bargains with the two large banks.
UBS would have become well too large, find-you it - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons moreover would have spread themselves.
The Swiss ones would have there nothing any more to say.
“And when well even, they for a long time adapted to manners of the Anglo-Saxons.”
That was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank which changed UBS, it made high benefit and then the rout: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-bonus like the Swiss large bank.
The catastrophe became connect on October 15th, 2008.
“This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertook the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation”, the author Lukas Hässig in his book “the crash landing of UBS writes”.
With up to 68 billion francs approximately, that is to say 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save bankruptcy the large bank.
How that could it arrive?
If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they especially see the problem in keeping with UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three Swiss large banks concluded an enormous group together.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and recorded an increase unceasingly.
What helped, it is that the two prédécesseuses banks different from UBS supplemented: a rich bank, but in lethargy with like strong point the management of credits to poorer Zurich and, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, the international investment banks had favorably access to much money, with which they could turn an enormous wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 Chief of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a team of dream”, said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the large modest intellectual, who gets along there very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one, which cut through a path until the top with the training of the bank.”
But Ospel would have trusted jusqu " at the end with Wuffli.
And wuffli would have probably made at the end a decisive mistake: “He thought that its models were reality”, known as Geiger.
“It is a tragic fall.”
Tragedy, perhaps.
A thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of UBS remembers clearly the meetings of the leaders during which the chief of the Wuffli group always pronounced the same watchword: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank of planet.
It ordered “League Tables” the classifications, which documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all UBS wanted to assemble all in top.
Certain stages already succeeded to him.
In business of currencies and transactions of securities she played a very important part.
The advisers of company, who had the responsibility for it, underlined however a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the banking jargon “Fixed Income”, there would be an enormous difference compared to the more large banks.
UBS would have gaps on the level of the American products of mortgages.
To fill this gap, UBS east launched out in an adventure, which almost costed him the life.
Made thirsty of growth, it is as well the bank itself as a bottom of management created before it in the American placements sub-bonus which invested.
It was transformed into a massive machine which packed and makes pass the documents of value based on the American mortgage financings - but which also preserved risks.
Even when other banks for a long time sought to go down.
“Still in the course of the summer 2007, whereas the market of the American real estate was in flames, UBS bought there”, said Geiger, the banking expert.
More the euphoria is large plus the fall is brutal.
A manager after the other had to leave, when to put an end to the attempts proved more difficult than one thought.
Stations at UBS became ejector and are until now bancaux.
That which directs the large bank has a task almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models disappeared.
The researcher of bank, Geiger has already an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration with the management of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want (still) to go also far.
But the investment bank must atrophy itself vigorously, as much as that is clear jusqu " now.
Next Thursday the chief of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51 years old Italo-Switzerland was only supposed to be on a purely transitory basis when the bank separated with surprised from its Grübel predecessor.
Meanwhile, it was essential: it must carry out the business of UBS durably, communicated the Bank of Zurich Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring back the investment bank to the progress report of the middle of the years 1990.
It cancels 3500 employment.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
With what does want she to earn money?
They are questions qu” Axel Weber was certainly already posed.
He publicly says until now only that he was going to seek with his wife an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.

The intelligent crows are propagated in cities
In much of places, rooks are regarded as “problem of oiseaux°” But the experts affirm that these very intelligent animals do not let themselves any more drive out cities for a long time.
Some like them, some others want to get rid some of as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city since centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents multiply because of the dirtiness and of the noise of the animals.
An antidote against the “°problème of birds” is not yet in sight.
At the time of the first ostfriesisch symposium on the crows, the experts said that it is not possible any more to drive out the rooks of the cities.
The experts of all Germany deliberated on the possible solutions.
They seek alternatives in the cities
The guards of nature also based the problems of the cities on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of the chemical products in agriculture destroys traditional living spaces more and more.
Hunting, the installation and the tree felling typical of incubation made the life difficult to the birds.
The crows are under protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couples of incubation in the westfälischen Soest, in the North-West among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim close to Bremen like in Leer.
In 2005, a discussed project had gained negative publicities because of massacre of the crows in this area.
Criticisms found the capture of the birds in traps and their slaughter with clubs particularly brutal.
“Normal expulsion, the ousting, is not used for nothing”, the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer noted, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests using water under pressure or to cut down the trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser de Lahr to Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse in other places.”
L " ousting is conceivable only in the exceptional cases as in the hospitals, the old people's homes or the schools.
“We are obliged to live with them, we cannot more exterminate them.”
The problem is not let solve in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of the animals to a aversif conditioning and accrocheuses offers, in order to allow them to reinstall itself elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, ATU Maria Jürgens prospected “panels of information instead of slicers” in order to establish completely different relations with: “We can finally better support a button with the face with an amount of self-confidence.”
Jürgens has Co-founded Ascheberger-advance-educational baskets with the Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing on the life of these very intelligent rooks.
This project was adopted meanwhile by the tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critic with regard to the noise caused by the birds: “Here are a large number of communication, these birds have to say themselves much”.
The intelligence and the skill of the animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only instruments of work to arrive at a treat but they manufacture themselves their tools like instruments of work.
Ethologists of the university of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, at which point the intelligence of the birds arrives.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they were to make collapse a scaffolding with stones to arrive thus to a larva.
Without much of training, they recognized déterminément that a stone was to have certain size and form to make break down the platform.
In a second test, the astute crows were to then solve a squater problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their spoils with their nozzle.
However, the researchers had placed pieces of wire at their disposal.
All the four animals formed a hook with the assistance of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four rooks one succeeds even as of the beginning.

The personal demolition of mass
The new book of Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Heading “The Beauty and the Sorrow: Year Intimate History of the First World War” (the beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begin with a long list from characters which tightens you the heart.
A council to start: tear this page carefully and make your mark-page.
You will learn how to know these people in detail. In this romantic account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these a few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fogs of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize of literature.
He wrote a book out of commun run here that he describes, with exactitude, like “a work of anti-history.”
It comprises some known names, of the important treaties or the famous battles\; one finds almost no ambassador nor discussion on the strategies and the material.
It is not a book so much on what it occurred, he explains, which a “describing book what that could resemble”. One finds there the “feelings, impressions, experiments and moods.”
“The beauty and sorrow” summarize the experiments in time of war of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, on the two sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists with escaladeurs, via doctors, ambulance men and salesmen.
Some will become of the heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become insane or die.
Their lives waver here like the candles of a church: whereas some die out, one relights the new ones.
The book of Peter Englund deviates from the traditional books of history.
It brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War is summarized only by the terrible war of the trenches on the Western face.
“The beauty and sorrow” skilfully describe other theaters of war: the Alps, Balkans, the Eastern face, Mésopotamie and Eastern Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives\; one passes Christmas to Egypt under the pyramids\; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving as of the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people a such natural disaster, a such Katrina hurricane which stinks cordite.
When blows of gun resound with far, and that you are a mother with the hearth, do you remain or flee you?
Who will come in any event?
Almost nobody can understand what it occurred, nor even reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts was packed by assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, theories conspirationnists, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
“The beauty and sorrow” follow individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse within the Russian army, like Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the fleet of German open sea.
Their stories are mainly draw from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or enthralling, but are preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
The majority approach the deprivation and the capacity to leave itself there.
By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund written: “Substitute, everywhere substitute. ”
“Coffee of replacement, false aluminum, imitation of rubber, paper bindings, buttons out of wooden.”
It continues on the food of replacement in Germany.
It describes “cooked made rice meat crushed in grease of sheep (and finished with a false wood bone)\; tobacco manufactured with dry roots and dried potato skin\; soles of shoes out of wooden.”
He affirms that “837 authorized meats of substitution are recorded in the production of sausages. One also finds 511 coffees of substitution.”
Certain stories approach the honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards brutality and declares in connection with the war: “You feel that after all, it is it for what the men were intended, rather than to sit down in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whiskey with the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than to claim that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and hobnailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he high risk to die, and that nobody will notice it or attention will not lend to it.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice itself, one hopes to have a public” writes it.
It is unfortunately rather comparable with “a condemned man strangled in secrecy”.
Other observations relate to the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.
“The conflict becomes more and more an economic history of competition” writes Peter Englund, “a war between the factories.”
It seizes the arrival of what it calls “a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass well articulated and ideologically convinced, in well cut clothing, which carries out its butchery while having sat behind a counter.”
People act in an unexpected way\; one finds as many basic behaviors of heroism.
Peter Englund speaks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid the service with the face.
“One finds the expression most grotesque in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and S " spread out over the genitals in the hope of finishing at the hospital”, writes it.
“Most desperate apply it to the eyes, which results in a blindness with life.”
In this translation of Swedish by Serious Peter, the prose of Peter Englund flexible but nonostentatious, is adapted perfectly to its task of humanity.
In tens of short scenes, it seizes the way in which the war “started exclusively unverifiable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for the religion. ”
People start to wonder why their leaders make them a war.
The best works treating of the First World War are often indirect, like “Great War and Modern Memory” (the Great War and modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or “In the west nothing again”, of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
The work of Peter Englund is the not very conventional Pantheon.
The end of the book is more overpowering that I read in a not-fictional work.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if it had emerged from its book, seized by your hands this page where figure the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first false step, an operation thoroughly planned
Hundreds of police officers were implied, certain carrying anti-riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was selected because the Zuccotti park would be emptier.
The operation remained secret of all except few officers placed high as of others informed as of the beginning which they were going to proceed to a exercise.
The police superintendent Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of the operation, his presence underlining the risks and the challenges for the department of Police.
There could not be repetitions D " episodes these last weeks, like the use of gas pepper against demonstrators, who went against the regulation of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation aiming at cleaning the Zuccotti park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and formation.
The police officers S " were prepared by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on L " island of Randall, for the operation with the Zuccotti park.
The police officers receive a better formation against the riots - measurements anti-terrorists which consist in moving a large number of police officers quickly - to concentrate on the district of Lower Manhattan.
The last training course took place Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan East River.
The orders given to move in the park arrived “at the last minute”, one declared accustomed, referring to the operation as with “a simple exercise”.
“The few police officers whom I know and who were called did not know that they would go to the Zuccotti park”, the person under anonymity declared.
“The only ones with knowing that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the department of Police.”
The city knew to retain a lesson, from where the secrecy of the operation.
On October 14th, of the police officers wanted to clean the park but were made push back by hundreds of informed demonstrators of the plans.
The operation of Tuesday implied officers of various units of Police, of which task forces of all the district - tens of officers accustomed to the particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly declared that many people went and came in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. One hour of the morning was thus a favourable schedule.
“It was advisable to proceed when the park counted less people” it affirmed.
Vehicles of the services urgently equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slipway and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, close to the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resounding of the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
Whereas the officers with the Community business penetrated in the park equipped with their light blue wind-cutters, of many demonstrators simply their business gathered and left.
No tent was touched before 1:45 declared the Police, which left time to the occupants to gather their business.
Other teams of police officers were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene so of the arrests proved to be necessary.
Journalist presents inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the chief of the department of Police, affirmed that this measurement had been taken only by safety.
But according to many journalists, the Police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly retained by the officers.
Mr. Browne declared that the trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west coast of the park, were able to capture images.
Whereas the Police moved towards the crossing west the thick tumbles of business of the demonstrators, including the luggage, the grass out of plastic and the bags of sheets filled of clothing, of the teams of the department of the cleansing followed, cleaning all that the occupants left behind them.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were trailed. The images were diffused on Internet little time afterwards.
The independent group of demonstrators took seat close to the kitchen of the camping, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier which the Police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people being with the epicentre of the camping clung together.
Lastly, two people were connected with trees, declared Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 affirmed Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the operation of cleaning finished approximately an hour and quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were stopped in the park.
majority for “disorder with the public order and rebellion”.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the department of Police, is the officer more graded with S " being found on the spot.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of the department of the detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not direct the operations” declared Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers waited along the east coast of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the event of intervention necessary.
Barricades were posed on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of park, as on Pine Street, in the south.
One saw the Police there widening well the perimeter beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, the majority equipped with shields, would even have been seen pushing people to move away them.
Nearly 28 people were on the northern side.
One of the actions more the sharp of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00, to the south of Street Prick, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen bursting the tires of a truck of Police.
At one moment, a plywood end emerged while flying of crowd.
Lastly, a police officer and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The trade union of the school assistances continues the city for dismissals
The trade union which represents hundreds of school assistances having lost their employment last month envisages to bring Wednesday a lawsuit at the city for useless and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on the schools accommodating of the underprivileged schoolboys.
The continuations are probably the ultimate weapon of the trade union, Conseil of the 37e District, to try to make cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred soixante-douze school assistances, coordinators of parents and other employees, being part of the least best paid city, lost their employment on October 7th. The trade union leaders compared these dismissals with a political revenge not to have let the city reach a bottom for health care directed by the groups of workers, and who would have allowed to enclose the variation of budget last spring.
The municipal authorities denied this charge categorically.
At the time of an audience of the Town council last month, the chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott declared that the dismissals constituted part of the budget enclosed in June.
A member of the Council counteracted, mentioning that the dismissals of school assistances N " were at all specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37e District declared that they would fill an opinion of claim, informing the department of the education which it would be continued\; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to officially announce the legal proceedings at the Supreme court of State of Manhattan.
Refusals Mr. Walcott and the department of L " education of the city will constitute the part defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight fired workers, very of black color or origin latin americans, as most school assistances which lost their employment.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the legal department of the city, declared that the municipality has not been able yet to see the reasons of the lawsuit and cannot thus make comments on the allegations.
According to an outline of complaints obtained by New York Times, the trade union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the most underprivileged districts of the city to support its complaint against an inequitable treatment, informant whom the poorest schools would lose the most assistances because of a regular under-financing.
While one counts no dismissal on Staten Island, and some hardly in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistances lost their employment in the 23e District of Brownsville, and 46 in 8th and 9th Districts of the southern districts of Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school assistances out of eight employees at public school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of the schoolboys live in poverty, the continuations affirm that “It is not a district of easy parents who can bring funds to fill the budgetary lack.”
The budget of L " public school 36 was tiny room of 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional financing for each inscription D " raises underprivileged.
The trade union also affirms that the directors of high schools could be induced in error by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo employed the term “going beyond” to describe the action, even if “going beyond” more generally describes the action to move a teacher of a school towards a group of workers available whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the project of complaints, “sixty-six coordinators of parents were laid off”, and “not only due to going beyond”.
Completed mission: the Congress reaches an agreement on the question of Libya
It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats reached an agreement in Capitol on the question of rising in Lybie.
One will have needed a successful rising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long time Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American implication.
The committee of the foreign relations of the Senate will have to make a decision next Tuesday, constant by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with the senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their “courage”.
“This resolution consists in honouring courage with the Libyans whereas they start to rebuild their country” declared John Kerry.
“It is a support bipartisan for their democratic aspirations.”
The language is perhaps inoffensive but the debate on Libya was never simple until now.
This summer, of the legislators of the two parties entered in conflict, like with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aiming at approving or not the military role of the United States in the mission of NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution aiming at authorizing the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The government bill was defeated by a broad margin bipartisane and never was the object of a vote to the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the government bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measurement aiming at reducing the financing of the American operations in Libya.
The American mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress sufficiently opposed to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut grass under the foot to him.
The indecision of the Congress was exceeded by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurrectionists in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20th.
The mission of NATO officially finished on October 31st.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee of the foreign relations “congratulates the Libyan people for his courage and its determination extraordinary for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women on the American armed forces and their partners on the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States arrive to a transition irreversible and successful towards the democracy in Libya.”
New measurement will it gain all the support of the Commission of the foreign affairs of the Senate or will divide it the legislators like last June?
The senator and chair Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) was opposed to the last version.
Its spokesperson declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not read the any last version yet again project.
Within Capitol, the Room must vote this week an amendment with the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrats.
The measurement, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a vote of floor to the Room or the Senate.
Other legislators up to now did not succeed in making approve their amendments but it is not without to have tested.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to the Congress, on a large range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same government bill suggested at the same time with the Room and the Senate - and others are light variations of a precedent.
One counts at least 15 versions with the Room only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle which “would control the federal expenditure”.
Some of these government bills are identical, but give to their supports - in particular the new Republicans who wish to gild to them CV - the chance to praise itself to be “the author” of such a measurement.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Act Control) approved last August required the vote of the Room and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators one voted in favor of a nonconstraining resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Congress can be useful, while Jose E. Serrano (Democratic - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
Jess L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multiplicity of amendments ensuring the right to an education of quality and the health care, inter alia subjects.
An amendment prohibiting the marriage between of the same individuals sex is perpetually proposed, just like the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Certain legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposite there.
As avid as were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the time of the 111e Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the time of the 110e.
Rate slows down compared to the beginning of the years 1990, when the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the provided figures by the library of the Senate.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have some today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27e - was ratified but proposed in 1992 with the Congress in 1789.
“Massacred but not beaten” Gabrielle Giffords at the time of his first televised interview affirms since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man drew to him above with end carrying with Tucson, Representing it Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic - Arizona) appeared Monday evening in a television program, sang “The Sun Will Like Out Tomorrow” of Broadway and stated to want above all to be restored rather than to turn over to the Congress.
During its appearance to the tv news “20/20” on the ABC chain, at the side of Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form sentences and needed assistance to go.
L " emission approached its difficult return following the ball which fractured its skull and bored the left side of the brain, while crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a return surprising to the House of Representatives to vote for the relative text with the ceiling of the debt.
At the time of his first televised interview since the shooting of January, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his re-establishment of “difficult”.
After Diane Sawyer asked him how it felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, answered “rather well”.
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at the time of a one hour old special edition from “20/20”, diffused the exit day before of the new book of the couple entitled “Gabby: a history of courage and hope”.
L " special program recalled the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting of January 8th.
In videos filmed per Mark Kelly at the time of the first weeks, one sees it on his hospital bed, the shaven head and a broad scar on the face.
It manages to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragements of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheel chair whereas the doctors learn how to him to carry out simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, its first word: “What”.
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (“Toast”) to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos diffused by ABC show the significant role of the music in the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords: one sees Representing it singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper “Girls Wanna Have Fun” and of Tom Petty “Free Fallin”?”.
At the time of the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends each day two hours with the doctors, stated not to remember a shooting.
According to her husband, it was in the train of him reading an article on the shooting of March 12th when it stopped it and asked for the first time of information on the six people killed at the time of the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, are held in a prison of Missouri and vigorously treated while waiting for the lawsuit.
“There were many deaths” declared Gabrielle Giffords in Diane Sawyer.
“Hard, hard, hard.”
During its re-establishment, declared Mark Kelly in Diane Sawyer, it said “I was beaten.”
“Thus I would say, “Gabby, you were not beaten”, Mark Kelly affirmed.
You have right summer massacred.
And you will leave yourself there, to be restored and return even stronger than ever.
More pity than of respect for the troops
The event: an official reception with Wall Street to collect million dollars for the veterans without hearth of the town of New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on the impotence, frustration and the loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
Crowd costume-gets in a headlock some put itself upright at her feet to acclaim it.
“The soldiers, men and women, are regarded as heroes”, declared David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds of spring.
One high-graded military present at the official reception, in which also the admiral Mike Mullen took part, chief D " staff of the armies of the United States, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were presented like a kind of orphan”, wrote thegraded military one in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know it.
But this N " was not respect. Just of pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations which settled between the soldiers and an impassioned but often distant American public.
Praises are lavished on the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, declare some soldiers.
The public acts more and more as if it were sorry for the men and women in uniform.
“We are not at all victims” declared the sergeant general Sean B. MacFarland, who directed the troops to Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only manner of supporting to us is to be locked up in the role of spirits unlucky person.”
It is about a very significant subject for the military leaders, who do not wish to appear nongrateful or in dissension with the public that they serve.
They also carry out that the anger of the returning troops of the war of the Viêt - Nam was quite worse.
Thus, most conversations on pity take place in all confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons of the combat with the Navy, reprocessed colonel Mark Cancian informed them that the public would consider their service under two prospects.
Some would look them with respect because they were confronted with insurrectionists and travelled towards remote regions.
Others would wonder whether “a veteran in anger and violent one hides under surface” declared Cancian, which fought in Iraq and returned to work with the Government in Washington.
When he sought an employment, he declared, he felt that some people who made him pass the talks asked in a subtle way if it would be able to immediately hold out under the stress of an employment requiring in Washington after his return of the combat.
“When you broach the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions”, colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the soldiers emerge, partly, starting from the American indifference towards the wars.
The victories are seldom congratulated by a country also not very familiar with the army and which sees few direct advantages of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we do not develop any more heroism of the same manner that for the Second World War” lieutenant general reprocessed David Barno declares, who directed the troops to Afghanistan.
Instead of that, the congratulations of the politicians and the people concentrate largely on the depth of the sufferings of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of endured periods of services, the number of lost friends or the extent of the wounds.
The army vis-a-vis the increasing pressure prevailing against the rapists
This week, a capital audience will decide if 28 men and women will go in lawsuit against the army for an inaction supposed concerning rapes.
If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the next one.
The soldier of 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was old of 25 years and 11 week old enclosure the night when she affirms to be violated by a soldier.
C " was in October 2008. It returned to its barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dined with a friend, when it met a colleague transporting a beer pack.
He asked to him whether he could join it in his room to drink glass.
“C " was an alarm” declares Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan one put side its concern.
I thought: not, it is 19 years old.
“It is of Texas” says it.
“I will have had to follow my intuition.”
A few minutes after being entered the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught it from behind, threw by ground and violated, claims.
This week, on November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will expect with anxiety the legal decision at the time of a historical lawsuit which will proceed in Arlington, in Virginia, and which will decide if a lawsuit carried against the former secretary in defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are shown not to have stopped the generalization of the rapes within the army, thus going against the constitutional laws of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, the lawsuit implied at the beginning 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to be violated or misused sexually by colleagues soldiers. They also claim that the army did not inquire, continued nor provided justice adapted after the pled attacks.
Susan Burke states to be caught some to the soldiers braided, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure” says it.
“Which are the individuals in position D " to eradicate the culture of reprisals? Leaders.”
The lawyer also declares that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, whose majority could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this business - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The team of defense, for the Department of Defense, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, deposited a motion to reject the case.
The legal documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defense, and primarily the fact that the army cannot be continued by soldiers in service or not for wounds caused in the armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme court, called the Doctrines Feres, the Federal government are not responsible for wounds undergone by staff in active service.
“The pled evil is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs” indicate the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to make any comment.
The things changed since the Fifties.
Whereas the women still do not have, officially, the right to go to the combat, this distinction is registered only on paper: the frontlines of the recent wars are seldom only male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important part, in particular to make contact with the local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers died - two thirds in situation of combat.
It is time for the army to be modernized declares Susan Burke.
It is not alone to carry out this combat: three other lawsuits are in hand besides his.
With L " school of right of Yale, the center of legal departments of the veterans prepares a business against the four principal military academies to have supposedly to encourage an environment misogynist.
In addition, the foundation with goal nonlucrative Viêt - Nam Veterans of America prepares a lawsuit against the army, while concentrating on the diagnoses of “personality disorders” allotted to the victims of the rapes in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women' S Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for the human rights.
Its group brought a lawsuit in December with the Administration of the Veterans, by showing them of discriminatory practices in the manner of treating the requests for advantages for the people stating to have been victims of a sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent from/to each other were introduced in the Congress by a bipartisan mixture senators and representatives, proposer various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the center of intervention and prevention of the sexual assaults (Sexual Assault Prevention and Réponse Office) of the Department of Defense.
But it is well-known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the proper estimate of the Pentagon, this figure accounts for approximately 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents which have occurred this year.
The report published in March also studies the percentage of legal proceedings: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were the object of a lawsuit - half of the percentage of the civil legal system.
The plaintiffs of the business of Susan Burke describe their aggression like the first of a series of traumas.
In the business of Lyman, it informs the military Police of the rape less than one hour after the facts.
This night, she says, one asked him to tell 11 times in details his rape with various police officers, doctors and commanders.
It underwent a “grater kit” (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of its attacker - had with a cut with its arm - was found in its bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge, with a lawsuit during which one earlier questions it on his sexual relationships with his boyfriend the day of his aggression.
Six people testified as character references for the author to the crime, which ended up being discharged.
“I remember the day when the verdict was returned” declares Elizabeth Lyman.
“I believed that I was going to start to have contractions. I put myself to shout after the court.”
“I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember to have said to my commander “Ce was not his lawsuit but mine”.”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making it inapt for the service.
In January 2010, it was returned under terms less than honourable, preventing it from receiving unspecified advantage.
The Lyman business and other plaintiffs will advance or not, it is a long story, declares John Turley, law professor with the Faculty of Law of the university of Washington.
However, he points out, “with my opinion, they should be able to advance”.
Only these doctrines criticized since its introduction are between them and a verdict.
I always criticized the Feres doctrines.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrent posed by the responsibility.
“The chances are heavily against them… but it is important that they test”, he adds.
These things change only when the goods have the will to fight.
If the lawsuit does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather his hundreds of other plaintiffs for other lawsuits.
“We will continue to beat us against the army on this question as long as there will not be reform” affirms it.
Where jusqu " so that we would die, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who informs of his opinions anti-immigration on line.
Monday, Breivik, which admitted being taken of a fatal madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with its first lawsuit.
Whereas Breivik has only acts, it was far from the being on the cyberspace: it had passed most of time preceding the attack on its computer, to discuss with some the million nationalists who support the groups of far right on the sites of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wish more on these people.
But how to find them?
Easy… You connect to Facebook.
“We realized that it N " was not so difficult that to find them”, declares Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a report published recently by the think tank of DEMONSTRATIONS on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebook abounds in as well personal information, affirms Jamie Bartlett, as the researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the people whom they seek with a scientific precision - the way in which the mercaticians do it since years.
L " equips with Jamie Bartlett discovered that a half-million members are fans of the groups of far right in Europe. It targeted them with announcements, but instead of connecting them to a new group or produced, the announcements invited the users to answer an investigation. The asked questions related to their level of education, their attitudes vis-a-vis violence and their optimism as for their own future.
While making contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues could question 10.000 partisans of 14 parties of far right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
“It is a new way of were research”, Jamie Bartlett declares.
Certain results are not at all surprising: the partisans on line of the groups of right-hand side are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those which associate activism on line and out-line are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent one that those which remain behind their screen of computer.”
L " study of DEMONSTRATIONS is only one example on the way in which Facebook became the new tool impossible to circumvent between the hands of the scientists.
The think tanks, the researchers in medicine and the political economists use the site to study all the subjects which touch the health questions like the social tendencies, thanks to “I like”, publications on the walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three contents per day, the “supernova of the data” generates an explosion as regards research, increasing the number of research tasks whose name of the site appears in the title from almost 800% compared to the five last years.
For certain researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it enables you to study people whom you could not approach in the street.
“Front, when you try to carry out investigations into the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You were to go to the party, but they would never have authorized you to enter”, Jamie Bartlett declares.
“Facebook avoids all that - you have access to their information directly. ”
Others say that the site could offer a means of identifying and to deal with the medical and social problems.
According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the university of Wisconsin-Madison, and his/her colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their exploits in a state about intoxication were likely enormously more to be alcoholic than the discrete students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could supervise the site and intervene to possibly help a student about which the statute would too often speak about alcohol.
“You cannot deal with a problem if you do not diagnose it”, Dimitri Christakis, joint author of Megan Moreno and director of the center for health, the behavior and the development of the children at the Research institute for the children located at Seattle, affirm Washington Post.
“We know how to identify the children with risks, and which would not be in another not recognized case.”
Facebook also reaches constantly information of its users.
L " equips with the site which deals with the data studied the statistics concerning the situation in love and the day with the saint Valentine, rate of participation with the elections of mid--mandate of 2010 and one index of national happiness (thanks to information only available - the champions of digital freedom supported for a long time that the site could make available its treasure of data to other people at ends of research).
But the users of Facebook know that the site, that they observe them or not like that - in return for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is to thousands of kilometers, the site is authorized to reach your information.
But what does it occur when the users of Facebook belong to an investigation about which they did not even intend to speak?
Whereas the researchers have instructions well defined as for the manner of differently collecting information than via the Internet, it is anything else on line.
“I do not believe that a large number of users already thought of the fact that a researcher can study their profile” declares Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 that it carried out by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
“As much as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends.”
Then the question comes from methodology.
Even without passing by Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
“What you say on Facebook and what you make in reality are two completely different things”, Neil Selwyn affirms.
This is why, in spite of his experiment as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a scratch pad and a pen remain the best tools than one can use.
“Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with people,” declares it.
“The social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social one, it is not in front of a computer.”
“Cold and inhuman”: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man having admitted to have organized the two attacks which caused 77 deaths in Norway this summer, described itself as a combatant “of resistance” during his first appearance to the lawsuit which proceeds in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Templars of Norway”, he explains in front of a courtroom filled of 500 people.
“With regard to the competence of the court, I challenge it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism.”
“I admit the facts but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik lasting this monolog because he “did not want to leave him opportunity of using this lawsuit to express his opinions.”
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, which brought with him a speech on paper, speech to the parents of the victims at the end of the audience.
Nesheim judge also asked the Police to keep Breivik in detention twelve weeks moreover, prohibited to him to speak with the media during four weeks and informed it that the authorities would supervise very close all the visits and correspondences during eight weeks.
About thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the audience.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind the bars.
All took part in the audience with an aim of seeing the end of the lawsuit.
“I found it cold and inhuman” a survivor of Utoya to Norwegian TV channel NRK declared.
“I N " stays not at ease, but I have personally a little advanced after having seen and having heard the suspect.”
Dressed in a funereal clothing and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional during all the lawsuit. It looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes while entering and outgoing of the court.
In spite of the strange idea according to which Breivik belongs to a vast movement of “resistance”, the judge determined that it was not insane. He also declared that there is no proof that it has acts with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22nd thus seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which will perhaps comfort some of them.
But that does not reduce sorrow nor confusion felt by all the nation.
“I will have preferred that it resembles a monster, but it is not the case”, a relative of a victim declared.
“That would have been much easier.”
7 lessons of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, with the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, some have it compared to Henry Ford - being characterized by the technical and inventive genius from modern data processing.
But what the fans of Apple can find of more revealing in a maintenance with Steve Jobs found recently and who will be diffused this week in first part of a film on the main markets, is at which point this creative spirit had understood the processes and flow of work of the products.
It was without any doubt a creator and a dreamer. It was identified with hippie but was also very meticulous person and organized, as well as ameliorative of flow charts - a man who believed that many managers of undertakings suffered from a “disease letting to them think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of work… [but] a considerable quantity of manual work separates a brilliant idea from a product of exception.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the televised series “Triumph of the Nerds”. This series recalls the birth of the computer, and it assoit during more than one hour with Steve Jobs for long and rare conversation.
At this time, that made approximately 10 years that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He worked already hard on his new data-processing company NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
Whereas a small portion of the discussion with Cringely is used in Nerds, he declares that the principal copies disappeared in transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the director.
This video, slightly gone up, is the film base the 68 minute old entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be diffused with the cinema Wednesday and Thursday next.
For somebody of known to hate the deepened talks, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and his sales strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long moment after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds from reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, with an aim of giving a precise answer.
One also discovers moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs re-appears, where it seems impatient to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him blows of elbow to make it accelerate and pass on questions or subjects of greatter importance.
Filmed before L " era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, one curiously finds an aspect prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers of good or bad at the other companies and fact share of his own vision on the future of data processing.
It is a thing of reading the posthumous evaluations of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of crude and of inspiring on the man whom we see here, the anxious dreamer the day before the size.
It has a vision on the way in which the things can be and must be.
He explains them then the mets of continuation in work.
Here a fast summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On the way in which he learned how to direct a company:
“During all these years, I always asked: 'Why you make the things?” and the answers are constantly the same ones: “oh, simply because they should be done. “”
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks in-depth of the things in a company.
It is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details on his efforts aiming at simplifying accountancy at Apple.
Perplexed as for the way in which the costs were recorded - one often begin with a “standard cost” evaluated at sight of nose, then adjusted with a “variation” - it developed an automated factory which guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On opportunity of playing a turn with the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the “Blue Box” which it created with Steve Wozniak - an apparatus which was used for pirating the phone networks and telephoning free in long-distance.
The apparatus was the object of many first writings, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
It describes the way in which him and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, while passing a call then while being connected of an AT&amp\;T network to another whole while circumventing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of various things half a dozen times and you howled in the public phone and that arrived to you later one minute at the public phone of at side,” explains Jobs while laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could ourselves create something able to control billion dollars of infrastructures in the whole world. ”
We did not know large thing both, but we knew to invent a small thing able to control large things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have one day existed without that.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a marvellous turn that him and Wozniak developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box right in the middle of the night while being made pass for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
Whereas several members of the catholic hierarchy are convened in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in giggle right before the Pope himself is awaked.
On its love with technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett):
With L " 12 years age, with hunting for the spare parts to manufacture a frequency meter, it seeks the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and a telephone call passes to him.
Shortly after their 20 minutes conversation, Steve Jobs obtains a job of part-time summer at Hewlett-Packard.
“That had a remarkable influence on me. C " was the only company which I had seen at this age and that formed my definition of a company and the way in which the employees are treated.”
Steve Jobs became one of the HP employees thereafter to visit the research laboratories of the company, located at Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop ever designed.”
It was as large as a bag, had a small cathode ray tube. I fell in love from there.
The teenager that J " stays is turned over to HP and started to write programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of the innovation:
Several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a blow of head.
At the beginning of his career, whereas it settles to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, it had to deal with the assembly as of the delivery of the finished apparatuses.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered to develop a mouse of computer:
“I remember large arguments… one shouted me above by claiming that it would take me five years [to manufacture a mouse which would cost $300]. I had of it enough, I left and went to see an originator.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse which we could manufacture for $15 and who proved incredibly reliable.
On the large companies which blow themselves:
Well before it revives Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way in which many industrial leaders were going to be mistaken and lose the control of their market share.
“Let us admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and afterwards?”
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the company does not meet more success.
The sales and marketing can make it evolve, therefore [they are these types of people] which ends up directing the companies and the staff specialized in product are put at L " variation of decision makings.
The genius of product which led to this position of monopoly is completely rotted by the people who cannot imagine to design a good product compared to a bad product - necessary manual work.
It is what occurred at Xerox…
Xerox could have held all computing industry.
It could have made ten times its size current. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the Nineties…
They tore off the defeat with the victory.
On the innovation like forms artistic:
“An enormous part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product… as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn enormously on its subtleties.
There are compromises to make… Certain things which you cannot make, the electrons can it, glass, the robots, the factories too.
You must keep thousands of things to the spirit (these concepts) by assembling them the ones with the others.
Lastly, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is a question of trying to expose you to best produced than the men created, and to try to bring these things to the product which you create.
Picasso said one day that the good artists copy and that the large artists fly.
We always have shame to fly of excellent ideas.
It is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked above were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best data-processing scientists in the world.
If it is not for computer science, they would have made extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with adversaries on the right of health whereas the court meets
The day when the Supreme court meets behind closed doors examining the political question of discord, namely if the opposition to the law of President Obama of health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at the time of a dinner sponsored by the law firm which will defend the business before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference aiming at discussing the petitions for examination.
One of the business in question related to a lawsuit brought by 26 States disputing the ambitious reform of the health care voted by the Congress last year, a law which was a rallying point for the preserving militants with the national scale.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected next March, and the result will be probably likely to support the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full rise at the time when the decision of the court will be rendered.
The lawyer who will be held in front of the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, will be probably Paul Clement, who was used like Solicitor General of the United States during the administration as George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, belonged to the two dozen cabinets which helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalistic Company (Federalist Society), a group of long time dedicated to defend the preserving legal principles.
Another cabinet which sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the partnerships which disputed the law, the National federation of the independent companies (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presents an enormous financial challenge in the result of the litigation.
The dinner was held with a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the business.
Was there, inter alia, Mitch McConnell, republican signal of the Senate and declared adversary of the law of health.
The guests star with the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalistic Company during years.
And there is nothing which goes against the rules of deontology.
In fact, the judges are exempted of code of conduct which governs the actions of the federal judges.
If they were it, they would undoubtedly argue by the code of Canon 4C, which stipulates: “A judge can witness collections of funds of the organizations related to the right and others although the judge cannot be intervening, a guest of honor, or being reproduced on the program of such an event”.
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms of the business, like for a company having a massive financial interest, sufficed to alarm the activists of governmental ethics.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference with regard to the code contradicts the declarations of several judges whom the Court respects the same rules applicable to all the other federal judges”, declared Bob Edgar, president de Common Cause.
“The judges drank and dined and with a collection on funds on official reception with lawyers who have cases in authority in front of the court”.
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event dismount any claim of impartiality, and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for the critics affirming that they too easily mix the business of the court with the diary of groups such as the Federalistic Company.
And the woman of Thomas, Ginni, is militant preserving of high-profile.
In addition, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Solicitor General of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law were carried to the level of the county court.
Its criticisms put pressure so that Kagan is challenged to hear the case, saying that it had been invested too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan did not give any indication that it would do it.
Boeing records an order record of 18 billion dollars for airliners
The Emirates airline company orders 50 Boeing 777, airliners bi--corridors, with the possibility of buying 20 of more of them.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners at Oman Air, a market estimated at more than one billion dollar.
There is nothing extraordinary so that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products.
It is on the other hand a whole business when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing planes and that the amount of these 50 planes reaches the sum record of 18 billion dollars.
Quite as incredible is which Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future orders of planes.
In forecasts published Monday, the company of Chicago estimates that the airline companies of the Middle East will need in the 20 next years for 2,520 planes for a total bill for 450 billion dollars.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the ordering of commercial planes most expensive of its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi--corridors.
It is the Emirates airline company based in Dubai who placed this Pharaonic order.
Boeing announced with the Aeronautical Living room of Dubai of 2011 that the airline company is also likely to buy 20 planes moreover, which would raise the full amount of the order to 26 billion dollars.
On another side, Boeing stated Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8, called Dreamliners, a model which flatters important savings in fuel and conveniences for the passengers.
The amount of these six apparatuses S " raises to more than one billion dollar.
“It is clearly very positive for Boeing,” declared Neal Dihora, analyst of Morningstar.
“These customers in particular have an immense value.”
In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have many of their airline companies.
They thus have not only the means of paying these planes, but a rise of the price of the fuel - usually prejudicial for the airline companies because it represents their most significant expenses - would not be so harmful for them since the country would earn money with the rise of the oil price.
It is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or to differ their orders from planes when the oil price increases, Dihora announced.
“They have a natural covering of risk”, he said.
The ordering of Emirates reinforces the prevalence of Boeing on the market of the planes large-carriers and assistance to slow down the attempt at encroachment of the Airbus competitor with its A350 plane.
The victory of Boeing to the Air Show sometimes happens four months after the announcement of Airbus to defer the beginnings of the largest version of A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes back its beginnings to increase by it the push following the request of its customers to increase his load capacity and its autonomy.
The actions of the Boeing company increased by 1.5% to reach the 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president obviously beaten with the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon declares that the drug traffickers helped his adversary Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race at the post of governor.
The sister of president Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her attempt at access to the functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she declared Monday that the drug traffickers supported one of its adversaries.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race at the post of governor of this State of the west.
“The intervention of the organized crime during all the process of vote and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country”, Luisa Maria Calderon announced to the radio during an interview Monday following the elections.
“They threatened our candidates, our campaign organizers… They seized the ballot boxes, installed road blocks… and obliged people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI controlled Mexico during seventy years jusqu " to lose the presidency in 2000.
But it organizes its return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to gain L " election presidential in July.
Vallejo seems to be himself dissociated only little of Calderon, which was at the top of the surveys before the day of the elections.
Calderon, candidate of the conservative party of his brother, the Party National action, or SIDE, refused to recognize Vallejo like winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently occupies the functions of governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of L " State, contradicted any bond with the drug traffickers and highly advised with the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán was dominated a long time by the cartels of drug specialized in the traffic of marihuana, heroin and méthamphétamine.
It is about L " Country of origin of president Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence persisted.
One week before the elections a mayor of the SIDE was assassinated whereas he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and of many candidates gave up the countryside by fear locally.
However, for the PRI, as corrupted as the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in its dash.
The man whom one waits to represent the PRI in the race with the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and declared, “I think that this victory is very encouraging for the next year.”
The ADB encourages Asia highly to come to the rescue of the euro zone
The Asian development bank required of India and China to prepare to help the euro zone to leave the crisis of the sovereign debt to avoid a long-term decrease which would prevent the development of L " Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the chief executive officer of the ADB based in Manila, declared that the two economic powers with the fastest growths of the world were “to do all that is in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area by the means of the Fund International currency or direct bilateral agreements.
It disadvised with the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking at the difficulties of Europe of a “indifferent eye” and announced that an Asian financial support at the sides of the leaders and resources of Europe would allow D " to avoid a long-term collapse of L " worldwide economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“Consequently whoever can help Europe to leave the crisis is useful”, he said to Financial Times during an interview during the World economic forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected jusqu " at a certain point but it is not with the shelter.”
“Thus if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them.”
These last months, the euro zone was seriously shaken by a crisis of the sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously assembled marks with arrows some and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The flourishing crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe made spout out the fear that L " worldwide economy does not return in recession, and caused the call of the principal emergent economies to meet to help the euro zone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the IMF would convey any Asian help, but he as declared as this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the funds of financial rescue of the United States, the Funds European of financial stability - offered a greater power to negotiate to the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Trade Minister and for Industry Indian, indicated that “India will do all that it will be able” to help the euro zone since its own economy suffers now from a fall of exports and a drying up of the arrivals of foreign assets.
“Nobody wants that the euro zone remains unstable and agitated”, he said.
“We have monumental challenges to raise and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
“It is not a choice, it is a requirement, because where would we find work for tens of million our young men and women?”
Others support that the economies under development such as India should not help the European rich person whereas they face their clean important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor with university Brown with the United States, has declared that it would be politically very difficult to make even less accept a help in Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars per day.
“One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and that they leave on vacation to the sun and they will have evil to swallow it”, he announced.
Lee Howell, the president of the World economic forum, also wondered why the reserves of India should be used to maintain many civils servant Greek paid well in the employment badly managed which generates losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag declared that the crisis of the euro zone was likely to cause “significant repercussions” through Asia.
The forecasts of the ADB of an economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011 /2012 now face “risks of loss” because of the European threat.
It announced that the vulnerable emerging markets had need D " to prepare “plans of help” to protect itself from an economic reversal and important capital flights.
Severe warnings of the Pentagon on the potential reductions of defense
The Secretary in Defense, Leon Panetta, made assemble the pressure on the Congress Monday, informing that the imminent automatic budget cuts would sap the national security. He started a financial chain reaction of the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, via the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon digests already 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next decade, but fears now that an additional amount of 600 dollars or more compressions is imminent if the Congress does not manage an agreement on the expenditure.
“The impacts of these reductions would be dévastateurs for the ministry”, declared Panetta in a letter with the Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He declared that the failure of the Congress to be managed a resulting budgetary agreement in what one calls sequestration, would involve 23% of reductions as well as freezing many new projects.
“Such an important reduction, applied thus without understanding, would return most our ships and of our impracticable construction projects - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and to carry seriously reached to the other efforts of modernization”, Panetta writing with the senators.
“We would be also constrained to separate us from a certain number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, should almost certainly send to us civilians on leave without wages in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those which support our soldiers and would damage our preparation seriously.”
The reductions would touch possibly the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
“Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of the operations of contingency abroad is not directly touched by sequestration, the efforts of war would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets”, Panetta informed.
“Staff contracting would be reduced, involving delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract which support the war”.
“Staff managing the wages would be reduced, involving delays of payment to the suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disturbed”.
The two senators had written in Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry for Defense.
“The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have would start a fast decline of the United States as an uncontested world chief of the military power”.
“We are savagely opposed to this Draconian action”, the senators in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter of Panetta declared.
“It is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not that which us should impose”.
“Sequestration is a threat for the interests of national security of the United States, and it should not have to occur”.
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon of reductions, remains to see.
Panetta was increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even if he arrived itself at the most station of the Pentagon cumulating of the years of expertise on the budget to the Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.
With a press conference the past week, the secretary with Defense painted a dark painting of what could occur - a soldier with a shell, but not of core.
“It is a ship without sailors”.
“It is a brigade without balls”.
“It is a fighter plan, without enough trained pilots”.
“It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs which do not have enough trained soldiers able to achieve the mission”, Panetta at the time of its opening remarks declared to the Pentagon.
“It is a depressed, badly prepared force and incompetent to face potential adversaries”.
“De facto, it invites to the aggression.”
In an addendum with its letters with McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how new reductions could “generate important operational risks: deadline for reply to the crises, conflicts and catastrophes\; severe limits with our capacity to deploy us and engage us in the world\; and risks assumed unacceptable in operations of future combat”.
And Panetta declared that some of the more great projects of defense could pass to the chopper, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.
This list included Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new laid down bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace Humvee of the army and the marine.
To put an end to the development and the tests of F35 could generate 80 billion dollars economies over 10 years, but its partisans say that it is a crucial step of improvement and answer to the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to locate a lie
A glance on the recent cuffs indicates to which point the fraud and the lie are omnipresent in the daily life.
The republican candidate with the presidency Hermann Cain is occupied exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women\; each side showing the other to lie.
The administrators of PEN State were accused of perjury to have allegedly covered with the reports according to which a trainer of football to the retirement attacked boys sexually.
Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a microphone open affirming to US president Barack Obama that Israeli the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed of the countries.
The member of the Congress of New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, passed for an idiot by quickly emitting the denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate with the presidential election John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of the campaigns related to the cover of an extramarital connection.
And then, none of that which lived the history will never forget the media circus that president Bill Clinton started while lying at the time of its second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The accounts of cheating to the tests of the school and the university are legion.
There were cases where the teachers gave the answers of the tests to the pupils in order to show themselves well on their evaluations of performance.
The mentors who should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and the cheating is acceptable.
How much fraud do we meet?
Over a day given, the studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, much of those are pious lies.
Another study showed that the foreigners lie themselves to three recoveries in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To detect or locate lies is an essential competence that each one must acquire, at the same time for personal reasons and professional.
Far from being a board game similar to, let us say, of the riddles, where the objective is to exclaim: “I had you”, the detection of the fraud is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected during six last decades in prestigious universities having undertaken an in-depth research such projects, in particular in psychology and physiology.
One of the search results is that the oldest myths on the lie were demystified.
The liars look you in the eyes.
They do not stammer, redden or are not always agitated.
Not from it to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the microphone-expressions facial, the formation of the question and the response time.
I spent several years to examine scientific results in the vast body and always emergent of knowledge on the fraud, and it is clear that the detection of the fraud is a modern competence which is easy to learn how and useful to surf in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include in particular the recruiting, the interviews, the negotiation or management.
The good liars are skilful with good lira the others, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how the others perceive them.
We know according to research which the extroverts lie more than the introverts, than the men to more say lies “centered on them” whereas the women say more lies “centered on the others” - usually to protect the feelings from somebody - that the married people less often lie to their partners than the nonmarried people (but that the lies which they tell tend to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived like a non-believer, the others will feel less guilty to lie you.
How can you say if somebody lies?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
It is what is called “to establish the data reference mark”.
That helps to provide a point of reference to measure the later changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, vocal quality.
You must know if somebody stirs up his feet normally permanently in order not to make unjust accusations when you see it stirring up the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then seek indices of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Regard these indices as red flags, not of the evidence of the fraud.
Misleading people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, to lean towards an exit, to change posture to a significant degree or to present a relief of “post-interview” - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions passed.
The interrogative ones indicate often wrongfully that maintenance is finished just to seek to start the reaction post-interview.
Also, made attention with the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson skidded while using the past while claiming that his assassinated wife was alive, starting a national research to find it.
The misleading individuals can also use an outdistanced language: “I did not have sexual relationships with this woman… Miss Lewinsky” or to entirely repeat a difficult question.
The verbal indicators most common are subtle.
Somebody can use much “set language” at the time of his answer to a difficult question: “Well… to tell truth… if I remember goods… to my knowledge.”
That rather makes the answer perceptive than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of competences to recognize the fraud is possible.
These competences will improve the chances of whoever to avoid the victimization by swindlers in their professional life and personal.
The plan of discussed pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States
A few days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a project of pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - causing the anger of the trade unions while alleviating the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project to give it on the rails.
TransCanada declared Monday evening that it will move the pipeline project out of the ecologically significant zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is trustful that the project all the same will gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at the time of a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The official one of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, affirms that the company remains trustful that it will end up obtaining the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
That made following the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision of granting of a federal license for the project until it receives from new studies of potential routes making it possible to avoid the zones of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, of vast sources of subsoil water.
“It is a true way forwards”, indicates Lee Terry, a republican of Nebraska with Fox News.
The new examination of the environment ordered by the State Department would have probably pushed back any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the civils servant deny the implication of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written declaration last week, described the decision as being the decision of the State Department, and to him expressed her support.
The pipeline of 2.735 km would extend from Canada towards the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700.000 barrels per day since province of Alberta towards the refineries of Texas.
With this intention, it would have to cross six States.
It is haï by the ecologists, but liked by working groups, which bet on 20,000 employment considered related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan put pressure that a law for force the distance of the area of Sand Hills and the aquifer Ogallala, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study in the course of the State Department found that the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the industry of energy declared that the general inspector of the ministry ordered an investigation distinct from the process of examination, centered into two questions.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser of countryside of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is to know if a company which was engaged to conduct the initial study were an inappropriate choice from its relation with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continued for allegedly caused an young child to vomit fear
A family of New York affirms that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in an outburst of violence in the hall of their building of Manhattan, terrified their little girl at the point where it has vomit of fear of it.
The tirade of the singer “Marmalade Lady” frightened the small Genevieve Monk 18 months old, so much so that it underwent “changes of personality, sleep disorders” and “the increased fear from abroad”, said his family during the lawsuit of the Supreme court of Manhattan.
It was on November 10th of last year whereas the technician of scene Kevin Monk, his teaching wife of nursery school, Roseanna, and Genevieve prepared to leave on a journey in family.
Whereas Kevin Monk was going to seek the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the hall from their building from the Riverside boulevard with their luggage, bearing Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk declared that it had stopped close to the door and had posed her daughter for one moment.
“Somebody arrived behind me and told me: “Do you Know what your daughter does?” I said “yes” and I went to seek it”, she says.
LaBelle admonished with anger the pregnant woman.
“She told me of an aggressive tone: “Should not leave You your daughter close to the door”, known as Roseanna Monk.
“I answered him: “what you say or think does not interest me”.
It became flared up and started to use swearwords - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice…
It had a water bottle and started to sprinkle me water of the bottle.
She declared that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
“I said to this woman: “Look at what you did with my daughter”, said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was thrown on the mom - who always held Genevieve in her arms - and had to be retained by its entourage which involved it towards a car which expected them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so extremely that it was put to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking of the excuses of LaBelle, but did not obtain any answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not turn over our calls to comment on.
The complaint claims not specified damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, declared that it took the case free and that the family plans to donate all money received with a charity work against cancer for the children.
“The goal consists in holding Patti LaBelle person in charge of her control”, Mr. Davis declared.
“This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially towards a teacher of nursery school carrying a 18 month old child.”
The climatic adversity slowed down the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and the informality increased, the foreign investment dropped and the economy contracted
2011 is one year which one will remember in the economic history Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, auto--called change, which generated great waitings with regard to the advances of the economy, but being given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, exchanges some there is a deterioration of the principal indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, except for causing losses of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the economy of the State for the growth, caused a contraction of the economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the history drops by 31.16 percent in the agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of assignments by the frosts resulting by the Mexican Council from Bearable Development Rural, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which one 78.03 percent suffered from the damage total and the remainder of 21.07 percent suffered from the partial damage, the principal cultures disaster victims were the vegetables, the corn and the chickpeas.
The fall of the economic activity generated, until November, a constant rise of unemployment in the State, according to the Institut National de Statistique and Géographie the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year one observed an accelerated rise, because while January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarters the rate became 5.28 percent and of the July to September the average continued to raise until the 6.19 percent, a rate who represents more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, a rise compared to first half of the year of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment with Sinaloa during the year is multi-factor, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic scenes and Sociales of the UAS, the rise of unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by the public policy.
“What one observes it is a rise of the unemployment which is due to various factors, between which the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of the resources by the legislation approved in the Congress to fight the money laundering, because for people who gain of the dollars in an illicit way it is not easy that they work to gain them, that they invest them and use them in something”, says it.
Held migration
López Cervantes announced that the rise of unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who give up the State to go to work abroad, in the United States was restricted, initially because of difficulties of entry and secondly because while entering they have already many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work it, with the result that unemployment raises”, he declared.
Miss the serious one
The market research of work sinaloen worsens by considering the high level of lack of serious which prevails between the work conditions, according to the INEGI, the 60.38 percent of the population working in this state works there without subscribing as worker at any institution of Social Security.
Except for unemployment and lack of serious, another reason of shift for the state are the low wages, the entity has lower remunerations of the Country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Work and Social Prévision.
The average monthly incomes of the workers sinaloens was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Except for fall of the economic activity and the rise of unemployment, in 2011 one recorded the strongest reduction of 10 last years the Direct Foreign investment, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the IED of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of the 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded during the same time of the former year.
In his turn, the Secretariat of Economic development of the Government of the State enters an entire investment of 17.280 billions pesos, recorded a year mainly by the companies of the tertiary sector.
The debt
Being given the economic scenario of contraction, the Government of the State requested in July with the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 billions pesos, intended for the investment in projects of infrastructure in the 18 municipes, with the objective to reactivate the economy, the approval of the congress of the State was of 2.600 billions pesos and until November one observed any benefit of the debt in no sector of the economy of the State.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of capacity of management of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Room of the Processing industry, declared that in 2011 it there did not have a harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, Ci-included the Government of the State.
“The output of the saving in Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, it is necessary to work intensely to recover the ground which we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, it was necessary to align the effort of all and especially the good walk already synchronized this again equips with Government, hope that the next year is much better”, has he says.
Economic slowness
Loredo López declared that events like the frosts of the beginning of the year retained the economy of the State and restricted its output and growth.
“Bottom fluxes economic is produced several events, between which the frosts, one of the principal effects was a slow economy which does not turn sufficiently quickly to generate an economic dynamism which makes it possible to have an acceptable level E flow in the lawsuits, products and services and consequently, at the end of the year we close much below waitings which we had”, he says.
To redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa stated that one wants to channel the State towards productive activities of more than dynamism.
“In general terms we observed that one worked, we think that it is necessary to develop a long-term program which redefined the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that one explodes all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa”, he says.
Much to make
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance to establish a vision of future which channels the efforts of the Government best.
“In general terms, I would say that the Government tried hard to give good performances in various fields, as regards economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop one programmed with long term”, declared it.
It announced that the current administration showed advances in the manner of management of the public policy.
“There are elements which enable us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say it is that one worked much and the Government is conscious owing to the fact that there is still much to make”, he says.

The director of municipal Social development indicated that even if until now the construction schedules progressed, they are in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State did not discharge not its obligations to offer contributions which exceed the 11 pesos million in the three programs.
It announced that in total, the investment of these three programs is of roughly 50 pesos million, of which the State must provide the 25 percent and until now only the Federation and Municipe provided resources for the works, consequently there exists the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
“They must provide a contribution of 12 million and in spite owing to the fact that the year soon will finish they anything gave us, even if since July they were to give us a part of it”, he says, “and us, not to record not delays, we began the works and we have much advanced, but we need the money”.

In spite owing to the fact that there exists a commitment on behalf of the authorities of the State to provide these resources, it declared that they had made asked it to the Secretary Administrative and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to activate managements so that the percentages corresponding arrive as quickly as possible.
“They must provide almost 12 million and in spite owing to the fact that the year soon will finish, they anything gave us”.
The Court validates “the analogical cut” in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of announce analogical by the digital ones is one of the exchanges more important than the world suffered last the years
The Supreme court of Justice of Nation (SCJN) nonsuited the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies formulated against the order in Council which advances the aforementioned “analogical cut” of 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not joined together.
A minority of four ministers, Ci-included the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that president Felipe Calderón did not exceed his attributions when it emitted the decree which details the actions to be followed to concretize the terrestrial transition on television digital.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was nonsuited not to have reached the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court comes to a conclusion about the constitutionality or not-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The project of sentence, worked out by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree like not-constitutional, because of fact that the regulation as regards radio and television is an attribution reserved by law at the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in infringment of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
With favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even.
With this argument, so much the Senate as the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to dispute the decree and by admitting the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by this one for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers solved to also nonsuit the complaint formulated by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which the minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his intervention, the minister chair said that it was not agreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general standards measurements so that the public administration prepares there.
“I do not consider either that if it did it one would affect the autonomy of the regulating body”, and it recalled that the planning of the public policies in strategic domains as the sector of telecommunications is the responsibility for the federal Executive, which has as a constitutional mandate the direction of the State.
The substitution of announce analogical by announce digital is one of the most important changes that the world suffered last the years and that is translated in a better exploitation of the radioelectric spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more chains.
To defer the change, supported it, would be to defer the benefit of the digitalization which implies a decision of public interest which does not have only one technical dimension, “because that understands also economic questions, social, political and of national security”.
These questions, underlined it, “require the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the economic principle of direction of the State, includes a group of attributions which the Constitution grants the faculty of the Executive of the State”.
He recalled that a large number of countries of everyone already finished the digital transition and they did it through Executive, in spite owing to the fact that they had the extremely specialized technical bodies.
One cannot conclude that the Executive, by emitting the disputed decree, invaded of a form the sphere of competences of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws emitted by the Legislative one, he ensured.
One analyzes the possibility of a calculation “votes by vote” with Michoacán
According to the data put in obviousness by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor are only 27 percent, even without entering the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total official reports.
The possibility of the calculation “votes by vote” is a reality with regard to the electoral lawsuit this year with Michoacán, where according to the data put in obviousness by the Program of Preliminary Election results (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without entering the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total official reports.
In this direction, the president of the General advice of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María of los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, pointed out that a few days ago, the past November 9th, the electoral body approved a series of hot lines to harmonize the local standards with reforms federal out of electoral matter.
One will remember that Michoacán approved neither its Political Constitution nor its Electoral code of State or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the Congress of the State approved reform them little before which finishes the legal delay so that this electoral lawsuit can come into effect and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication in the intended deadlines by the Law of the Official journal of the State, with the argument of that it had some objections.
The same November 9th, the Supreme Court of justice of Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Power Legislative and qualified like “invalid and illegal” the vote of the agent of the state for the constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right “to sanction them or dispute”.
Interviewed on the possibility of the “vote by vote”, María of los Ángeles Llanderal declared that thanks to the approval of the corresponding hot lines by the General advice of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total calculations votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the calculation partial of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the official reports do not coincide\; there is no official report of poll and calculation in the file of the ballot box is not in the president of this one\; or there are errors or obvious deteriorations of the official reports.
Moreover, the total calculation of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election could be carried out when there is an index owing to the fact that the difference between the supposed candidate gaining of the respective election and that which obtained the second place in the poll is equal or by lower part of a point of percentage\; on condition that at the beginning of the session exists a petition express of the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the announced candidates.
The total calculation of the poll can be carried out as so at the end of the common calculation it results as the difference between the candidate supposed winner and that of the second place is equal or lower than a point of percentage, on condition that which there exists the petition express of the representative of the political party which the candidate left second, case in which one will exclude the electoral packages which were object of the partial calculation.
It should be mentioned that is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 pourcent, even without entering the votes of 129 of the 923 total official reports.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
Indicated the Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government which will face a crisis which put this country at the edge of the economic disaster
Indicated the Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government which will face a crisis which put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and put in danger all Eurozone.
An official statement of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
It is waited until it presents a cabinet made up in its majorities by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive assumes its station.
Monti said that it was going to have to the president the result of his conversations with the political parties in its test forming a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult phase”, the former European Commissioner said to the journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of its comments indicated that the obstacles were surmounted.
The “framework is now well traced”, he added.
Monti supplemented the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time more reduced than normally, while Italy fights a political crisis and financial which pushed the costs of its debt on levels impossible to support.

The support of PDL, the Italian party largest, are significant because until now many of its members had been opposed to the Government of majority technocrat that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be reform of austerity unpopular.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could cause new and devastator attacks financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches was added with the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday her consultations with the employers' political parties, trade unions and groups and of the youthful organizations and women.
It will finish its round of meetings Tuesday at the night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, which entitled an extremely fast transition in answer to the crisis.
After a short respite at the end of the past week, when it was clearly that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt now reconsidered on critical levels between uncertainty the success of the new Prime Minister.
To save Italy, with a national debt of 1.9 billions euros, it too would be for current financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti said that its Government should persist until the future elections, provided for 2013, in spite of the predictions generalized on the fact that the politicians will give him only time to apply reform them before advancing the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the great parties insist on the fact that this one must be only formed by specialists, an index of their objections in front of a process obliged by the financial pressure.
Political sources announced that reciprocal mistrust and the dissensions between the parties complicate the test to include political figures.
The experiment of Spanish is higher than that of Costa Rican
Of the 22 footballers called of Spain, ten took part in more than 50 international plays.
On behalf of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened took part in 50 meetings.
An enormous contrast with that of Costa Rica, if one compares the 22 convened by the two countries for the friendly one of today, at 15:05 hours, at the National stadium of San José.
While the national champions and of Europe, the number one of the monthly classification of the FIFA, enter a full register of plays inter-select of class A, the Tricolor one only has the defender Michael Umana like the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached Friday spent in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs of First League of England, maintain at the year intense activities in championships of league and cut nationals and arguments in European cuts like the Champions League.
For all that it is necessary to add the experiment with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminating heats of the European Cut and the World one of football.
The Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to a zone, like Concacaf, which is considered of a lower level in the FIFA.
Us see that the larger record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who saturday former against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalized the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor one and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international plays.
Xavi Hernández, wheel cerebral of Barcelona, has 106 of them.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the former week by UEFA beside the other centenaries of the ibérienne team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the center-forward of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Loan of the figure centenary is Carles Puyol, with 97 plays.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91\; Fernando Torres, with 90\; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81\; Andrés Iniesta, with 62\; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, 53.
Costa Rican share, and close to Michael Umana are side the left Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barring with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and Jose Shine López with 35.
Less.
Those which have some less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain appear Gerald Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The remainder does not even arrive at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four plays and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar in only one has and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not begin yet.
The historical striker of Spain east David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is that which records of it more, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has includes the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"" Aller to Costa Rica is a dream which became reality”
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bass player Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one in its best concerts every next Sunday on the National stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will be also a dream become reality to occur in this country.
It is that the bass player and founder member Jeff Ament ensured, while speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, the past week.
The group is in the South American wing of its round of two decades celebration of work and Sunday the 20th will make its single stopover in the Central America.
This day will present themselves on the National stadium, as from the 19:30 hours, the group of Los Angeles The X and the nationals of Mow Robertas.
That is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in Nación on Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will occur in Costa Rica is a dream become reality. Are you conscious of what your fans live?
To go to Costa Rica is a dream which became reality for us too.
This one is our second time in South America and Centrale and until now that was imposing.
I passed to Costa Rica only once the vacancies\; it is a so beautiful country and I think that we will be able to spend a few days there.
That thus affects us to carry our music over there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live with intensity the former days.
Which is your message for your more enthusiastic followers?
Thank you to remain beside us during all these years.
It were necessary 21 years so that we arrive to Costa Rica\; thank you to have waited so much and we are sorry owing to the fact that such an amount of time had to pass until this concert.
Some people say already that its concert is the larger show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the shows larger than we offered during the last 21 years took place in the two last weeks.
We offered one two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that formatted to us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient to produce us there.
We like this country, we like to make surfing and the jungle\; for the two things, Costa Rica east one of the best countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and her waves to make surfing?
We have many friendly surfers and I have very a good friend which lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible over there.
My friends were always going to make surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, beside Mexico, is great places to make surfing\; thus taught we it, through the races which like surfing.
By seeing the round, to you aves offered enormous shows, with much of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we never occurred over there, we do not have any restriction with regard to what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a large variety of songs\; we will try to interpret two songs of each album and to offer to our fans a good and various repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
With what does have that?
I believe that it is partially because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, therefore it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire which we did not interpret any more for a very long time, that helps us to remain concentrated and surprises us because that points out the reasons to us for which we like these songs and that we can have forgotten.
That made that the show is more interesting for us and consequently I think that it becomes also more interesting for people.
With this round, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
While looking at behind, is it difficult to believe all that you made a success of?
Yes, absolutely.
Initially, I believe that none us had thought that we were going to form a great rock'n'roll group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes that seems a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact of being able to continue to make music together affects us much.
We like and we adore to create music.
We are lucky of going to places of the world to which we always wanted to go.
The things could not better go for us.
What means for you the fact of having been a basic element in the creation of the grunge one?
That was always an honor for us to form part of this group of great groups.
We are very friendly with people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is not very common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
The last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their round, therefore we are lucky to be still friendly with all them and it is an honor for us to form part of this sound of Seattle which has emerges.
It is as very strange as a group as yours is maintained plain and with the same members for so much of time.
Yes, four among us were together during 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much more time than much of groups last normally.
Initially, I believe that we all are lucky to be still in life and, in second place, we are worried all for the others.
We all are close friend and grace has that there are musical boulevards which give freedom to each one to test.
We one in another have confidence with the music of each one and that could not better be.
Your relationship to the word celebrity was not easy\; however, thanks to your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, that was easier for us to find a balance.
We ensure ourselves owing to the fact that we do not spend too much time in round because it is easy to fall into this play from the great multitudes and people who like your music.
If it is not forgotten that people are there for the music, that help us not to forget that it is necessary to respect the music and what brought it, without putting the fact at the head that one is famous and a rock'n'roll star, which really does not interest in any among us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think that we wrote good songs and at that beginning was imposing.
We were a group during almost three years and we did not publish a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations for the fact that it lasted if little and most important is the fact that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) which started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photograph I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, that was always a pleasure of working, of laughing, of speaking about the music, football and much other things with him.
It was a human being surprising and we miss it.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for this reason chose it to you for the opening?
Yes, the production sent to us videos with various proposals and that one was the group which we liked more, therefore we are impatient to see what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting.
For what always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This one is a question for ED (Eddie Vedder), therefore I do not know.
It is him who sings it and I believe that it makes it with the first words that it imagines.
As are bass player, which his influences?
There is so much…
Among the first of which I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Cleans, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski…
There are as well influences, as I could speak all the afternoon on the bass players whom I adore.
How did Pearl Jam succeed has to maintain raising the grunge one in spite owing to the fact that this one is not any more with the mode?
I believe that we all we feel disconnected a little from the grunge word.
When I think about it, that points out the groups to me which I have just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those which have emerges at the same time and, if that is raising now, I believe that is marvellous, because it is a music which is worth the sorrow to listen and the groups as Mudhoney make the best music now than ever.
At the beginning, its music had more obscure contents and maintaining this one became more positive.
With what does have this change?
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album which seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End gold Just Breathe qualified like very obscure songs, even if those can sound a little positive.
With both, when ED played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and those are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose with a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, undoubtedly, represent that for me.
I also think that one can also be happy and even as that one can make obscure music.

Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate the political bonds
An official procession, having with the head the president Uruguyan, Jose Mujica, and trained by various ministers and owners, will initiate this Tuesday a visit in Mexico to extend the trade between the two nations and to approach political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the point higher of long a diary of meetings with the political authorities, commercial and a meeting with the community of Uruguyans resident in Mexico, according to the diary diffused by the Uruguyan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the town of Guadalajara, will be “favourable for the exchange of information in the political matters between the two nations”, according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its Web page.
According to the local mediums, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, have includes the South American country on the list of the tax havens, in the meeting of G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In her speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries which continue to be tax havens, a declaration which caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consultations of its ambassador of this European country.
Mexico chairs since November G20, a formed group by the emerging countries and developed stronger of the world, and has into force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguyan government tried the last years to dispatch the concretization of the agreements of tax exchange to leave the “list gri” the Cooperation organization and Economic development (OECD), integrated by countries which do not implement all the international standards of co-operation out of tax matter.
On the commercial plan, Mexico and Uruguay into force have since 2004 a Commercial Treaty Free (TLC) which increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber man with a moustache passes to three dimensions with “Super Mario 3D Land”
Super Mario fought, untiring, during 25 years to save with the Peach princess of the claws of malicious Bowser, but it had never done it in three dimensions: in “Super Mario 3D Land” he will fight for the sake of the young person in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at the stores of everyone, was designed as of the beginning for exploiting well the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, which makes it possible to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who must say as must function the stereoscopy without glasses”, declared the person in charge of specialized press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that “Super Mario 3D Land” is “the first video game of Nintendo conceived initially for this support”, because until now of successes like “Star Fox terriers 64 3D” or “Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D” was adaptations of the existing titles.
The spokesperson of Nintendo supported that, in spite to be in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “accessible” video game which allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez affirmed that “Super Mario 3D Land” contains two plays in one: the first part is “simple” to hang the less skilful users.
Once surmounted, most expert will be able to make a “second turn” on the levels of play, which this time are more difficult.
Moreover, the users will be able to choose at real time between “D aggressive” or one which only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary of cheek in three dimensions to be able to overcome the various challenges and “not to succumb to optical illusions”.
This incursion of Super Mario into three dimensions supposes also the return of the character to a mobile console, fact which did not occur since 2005 any more.
In these video games Nintendo makes a wink with the followers of the sagas and repeats the formula of success of the plays former, which consists in the fact that the plumber man with a moustache must traverse platforms mined of dangers to release with the Peach princess.
Even if I player find innovations in the movements, the environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of “playable” Luigi.

Property invaded by squatters for microphone-festivals, evacuated
The invaders had adapted themselves of 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants gave up the property at midday yesterday without any resistance
All seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 of Street Balmes lived ended.
Twelve people gave up at midday yesterday voluntarily the building which they occupied illegally and where they organized of the microphone-festivals which despaired the neighbors, by legal order and without need for an intervention of the police.
At the end of the operation one changed the bolt of the door to prevent that the situation is repeated.
“As from this day there will be an access control”, the administrator affirmed.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the remainder were inhabited, carried electrical installation and part of that of water, except for painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind there, especially of limp of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of the festivals of masses, which lasted until two days and despaired the tenants.
Beside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europa Close as of the occupation of the building its business lowered one 80%.
The owner of the discotheque evoked that the invaders of the property made him unfair competence, because they sold glasses with three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the room of leisures had had to answer the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to this one, the troubles were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the festivals organized over there, who were more frequent and intense the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the zone.
The person in charge of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so large that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and that made nine months that this one “forgives him” the rent.
Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last weeks they had received more complaints on behalf of the neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested the week last “the immediate evacuation of the building to finish with the problems of joint life and good citizenship that this one caused with the residents and the degradation of the zone”.
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in certain apartments there were flights too.
It is in this direction which he added that “it is necessary to finish with impunity and to be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in the property”.
Yesterday also, Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building with Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police moved towards number 35 of Street Mount-ral, after having received the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people reached the building.
The four were stopped immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the appropriateness of the convocation beyond the polemic on the fees
The municipal competition based on the 16 doors again begins the debate on the role of Collserola to Barcelona
About the middle of the years '80, in full apogee of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed small posters of promotion of Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it contained also a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of much of people, limits it higher of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being alone which is not directed towards the North-South axis, the if not high one (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is with the advantage of this idea.
The reference was not any more Central Park if not Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the bear Yogi.
That was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a méga-competition composed by 16 contest for all the access doors to Collserola.
A door gives to the idea of park, without any doubt.
It is that, or somebody wants to put doors at the field.
The question appears all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The contest, so much with regard to its organization as with regard to the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent theme whose two members of this former caste of elected officials speak when they are recognized in an elevator.
And that is precisely one of the rare opinions on which three architects of Barcelona coincide, university professors, who presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is convenient.
For Roldán, after approaching the face littoral “it is necessary” to discuss on “the face of mountain” because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of green blocks of houses was not led to end.
“It is necessary to leave the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Inter alia things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex”, the verdict the architect gave for whom the title of “doors of Collserola” contains a “trap lexicon”: one should not think of those “like the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of certain zones in which it is necessary to act”.
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experiment in the urban world, qualifies the proposal like “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers”.
Dangers which are derived from “the uncertainty of the projection of public space” after the experiment lived in the years '80 and which had in the zone of the Forum “its song of swan”.
The first fear is the proper delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
“To limit something means to establish the following step already”, i.e., its going beyond.
“It is necessary to think of new urban instruments, of planning, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters”.
While being held more with the question, Modol opine that, while simplifying, the slope of the area El Valles de Collserola “can be heard like a park, that of Barcelona, not”.
Modol recalls that there exists already a job done by the Employers of Collserola which “should not be lost”, while thanking for opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project “as of the first moment”.
Moreover, he hears that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct which allows the architects to enter the debate, but “doubt” if this profiles technical must direct the multidisciplinary teams (“a whole success”, he says) that one has to create: “Us, the architects, should be only one instrument”.
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question which gives the title of this part is complex, bus of the bases of the contest it misses a comprehensive view of Collserola: “One convened 16 transverse contests - known as-it - in the mountain-MER direction, but there is not a longitudinal reading which sees and understands the zone as a whole”.
This made, at least in this case, which he chose to take part in the 16 contest.
In another manner, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the close door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the band immediately above than that of Ronda de Dalt should envisage, in all its extension, a zone of equipment which carries out a soft transition between the city and the green.

On October 25th an order of capture was emitted by the clerk of the Second Penal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence confirmed to determine the culpability of Jonás, like that relating to the cashing of 1.5 pesos million of the representatives of the house of play in return for allowing his operation.

The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which his life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora lost and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to test an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot noted that the conditions of climate were adequate to fly.
“The elements which seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees with 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage”.
It also informed owing to the fact that the unit was conceived for 19 people, therefore this one met the requirements necessary to transport staff.
Moreover, he said that the investigations made in the zone of impacts do not bring back the appearance of parts on the ground.
“In a research one reported that there are not parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact arised in a structural way.
“The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The ground presented a seven pante to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary ensured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible\; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In its turn, Gilberto López Meyer, chief executive officer of Airports and Services Auxiliary ensured that the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the State Majeur Presidential functioned of speed of cruiser and that occurred on an ascending soft ground.
“This information supports the assumption of an operation normal cruiser at the time of impacts”, he says.
During the press conference, the holder of SCT, Pérez Jácome, enumerated six significant components in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to normative aeronautics, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions on takeoff, and as the aircraft advanced towards the zone bordering between DF and the State on Mexico there were layers of nebulosity to low height.
Selected roads:
It is probable qu " because of conditions of nebulosity the crew sought a weaker zone height and more visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Localization of impacts.
The coordinates of impacts and the last registration of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before impacts it had neither loss of control there nor deterioration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
Information available until now makes it possible to suppose that impacts it took place on a right and side trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft makes it possible to suppose that the helicopter ran up the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
One did not detect traces of fire or explosion:
In the place of the disaster there is always no trace in the remainders of the aircraft of a kind of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During work of ground one found parts of the aircraft to a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above mean level of the sea, the ground presented a slope which goes since seven dismantle with 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was possibly disjointed along its way.
Information provides elements which seem to indicate that the helicopter can have had impact multiple with the ground.
After meticulous research in a zone fuller than the encircled place, around the accident, one did not find parts disperse aircraft, which supports the presumption of the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
Ms protocol announces to find gene of obesity
Social Security directs an investigation to discover gene of obesity in the case of the children and young people\; this is supported by specialists in the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it directs an investigation to discover gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called Genetic protocol “of the obesity of the children and teenagers” who will allow to have the markers associated with the overweight.
In an official statement, the chief of the Unit of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialities of the National Medical center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that one had trained a multidisciplinary team doctors, nurses, nutritionists and assist social.
This team is supported by specialists and post-graduate students of the National institute of Public health (INSP) and Center of Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
To the investigation one invites to take part the population being entitled or not, to present itself to the participating sporting units of the IMSS with Valle of Mexico City, where the evidence with the minors all the samedis as from 8:00 hours are carried out.
It stressed that the protocol started in the Sporting Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado of Mexico City Poniente) and that starting from October 8th, the activity is held in the Sporting Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado of Mexico City Oriente).
After having achieved the goal to join together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sporting Unit Independencia (in the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sporting Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that E to know the components and the importance of the genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify at the children and young Mexican risk factors to prevent the appearance of the chronic degenerative diseases.
As one will celebrate on November 14th the World Day of the Diabetes, it mentioned that the objective is that to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the assent and under the surveillance of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to the food.
They will be also asked on their physical-activity and their antecedents of family heredity their diseases, to avoid the risk factors which start affections like the diabetes or the renal insufficiency.
It detailed that the samedis one will apply to all the participants of anthropometric measurings (weight, size, circumference of the size), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (one seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López announced that this investigation is the fruit of the concern of the health professionals for alarming taken weight in the case of the minors.
“The investigations of health of 1999 and 2006 announced that in only six years there was a rise, in the case as of boys, of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case as of girls of the 47 percent\; with regard to the overweight one also observed a dramatic rise”, the specialist in the IMSS underlined.
It indicated that the justification for the research of the markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from different by its genetic history.
It informed that on average, the Mexicans have one 65 percent of indo-American heredity, one 30 percent European and one five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with the diabetes and overweight.
He explained why in general, the genetics of obesity is translated in the incapacity to burn the excess of energy which one consumes (calories), who settles in the shape of grease.
The researcher explained that the benefit direct for the participants it is the integral evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect if they present a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even known as that the presence of the folds of color sinks (acanthosis) on the neck and the front armlever indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic deteriorations and even pre-diabetes.
Information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, to which one explains each measurements and change in the lifestyle that they must carry out to prevent the diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three components principal which causes overweight, obesity and other chronic affections: the sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical-activity, to remain most the day sitting in front of the TV and to use means of transport instead of going on foot at short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greatest consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie to the cornstarch wrapped in corn sheets -, bread, pizza pie, hamburgers, etc) with high contents of greases and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher of Faculté of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops the asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with a better output, independently of the environmental conditions and temperature
If announce them that the paving stone were solved, it would not be necessary any more to repair approximately 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of Mexico City, informs Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of Faculté of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous paving stone is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its conference a technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it announced that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops the asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a larger mechanical resistance, so much with the high ones like low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this kind of modified asphalts could be used in places in which the climate is extremely hot, like certain cities of the north of the country, to improve the output, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained why asphalt, the heavier share of oil, is a set of molecule, hydrocarbon molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a molecular weight low, called malthenes, which together give to the paving stone its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, with 120 degrees c its viscosity is very large and to 50 degrees c it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes breakable, he added.
That means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, informs the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible paving stone, composed of six layers of materials, whose three last imply asphalt.
Between the surface layers the layer of asphalt is, formed by small stones bathed out of asphalt and compacted later on.
Each small stone which forms the layer, announced it, is bathed year asphalts.
When the vehicles pass there while generating efforts, this one allows that the forces are propagated very well in the paving stone.
If there were modified asphalt, those would be propagated better, opinât the chemical ingénier.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, one puts a last layer called course wearing, made out of fine stone, i.e., sand which is also bathed out of asphalt.
As this one is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the layer of asphalt and provide adherence in the street.
Being the part of the paving stone which receives and distributes the efforts, the wearing course also requires that this one have an adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be neat.
The climate, especially moisture and the temperature variations, are also a factor very important to consider, especially water, he says, because those affect considerably the output of the layer of asphalt.
When the ground is wet, water is spread inside the layer is it is difficult that this one left, which softened all the layers of the paving stone and consequently causes blackcurrants.
In the lawsuit of formation of a blackcurrant, he says, the first which trowel is the film of bearing and only later on is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage does not take place immediately, but these is a process which must be neat with the first signals with adequate programs of maintenance.
The member of the National System of the Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another significant factor for the blackcurrant formation and consequently the thickness of each layer of the paving stone must be always related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent blackcurrant formation.
Rafael Herrera informed that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to easily repair blackcurrants and without having to use high temperatures.
What missed the candidate of Valle to be the new Colombia miss?
Analyzes factors which made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not obtain the crown of Colombia miss.
Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to gain the crown of Colombia Miss.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact of being on the podium of winner, of carrying the money crown and the band which accredits it like new princess of Colombia.
With result obtained yesterday evening with Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is ridden with the crown and the sceptre, the department nap already 14 titles of Princess and Melina to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Gisele Bitchy girls Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Bitchy girls Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many people installation are:
What did it miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite that in each presentation showed that it had it very to be the new Colombia Miss, because it had not been elected in vain Reine of the Pretty Police and Meilleur Face of Vogue, of the titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who carried the crown of Colombia Miss.
Is the first factor considered key in the decision taken by sworn to indicate it First Princess the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question “? Which was the book which marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
“I read much, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, definitively I believe that the book which marked my childhood is “the small prince”, it is a rather deep book.
Now I read “Crime and Punishment”, it is a book of universal literature which should read to us all\; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, Russian, a very beautiful book which is called “the heat of blood "".
This answer does not have first of all likes because of term “culturaliser” and secondly not to explain concretely how each quoted book had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony declared that it felt quiet and happy with the result “the universe and wise, he happens what must occur.
And for everyone, read please a little, “the small prince” is a large book”
Between the launched assumptions there is that according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist of Bogota insinuated that being preferred, applauded and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), “that awoke the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore it did not shine on the scene”.
And one noted that in his first presentation in bathing suit with the beach of Hilton and his two processions of the crowning day before.
Even if with the two processions it had appeared sure of it even, it were noted that it did not have the force and the energy of representing of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program “Como put some” (As at the house), of the RCN Channel declared that the fact that Melina had been indicated princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most price during the contest does not receive the crown of queen”.
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was an error.
Another assumption it is that Valle did not succeed in convincing the jury on his interest for the social initiatives, which is in fact the petrol of the National competition of Beauty.
Therefore two days before the sworn election international Lucy Doughty declared that they sought a woman engaged with regard to the social needs for his country.
“Only the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond the physique and to center itself on its social sensitivity, why before beginning the Contest already are implied in projects”, she explained.
One also speculates that Valle sinned by its defects of sound behind and the fibrosis which was observed in its abdomen, but that is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected it like the candidate “Beauty natural” with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The preparer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there in was better, “but its problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which actually for me had not been too notorious, left points to him the last day”.
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos review considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were surgical operations which it had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle did not know to do them.
Its body was never its asset and it lost because of this aspect”.
For this price, that the National competition of Beauty gives for the first time, after the procession in bathing suit has emerges a cruel prediction which was achieved yesterday evening, one said that was a small present that Raymundo made in Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins a year of reign today, not like sovereign, if not princess, a position which gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of National competition.
However, it will pass in the history like one of the queens who in spite of sound dazzling passage by Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali which identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopist of Cali passed to the history as the man who confirmed the death of “Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these civils servant is crucial.
The past November 4th a dactyloscopist of the CTI of Cali passed to the history like the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of Farc: “Alfonso Cano”, by confronting its digital fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of “disponibilité' of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada which has worked for 21 years in the legal field of investigation.
At the beginning of its career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where much time it had to pass more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place in which corpses qu were to be identified.
The year 2000 it was done transferred to the capital from Valle and after having follow adequate courses, it specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and the feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano one had informed in Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days.
Something of very large expected it.
Friday the night it left for Cauca in a helicopter Palmira.
It knew that it was to identify two corpses and that one suspectait that one of them was that of the man who directed the older guérrilla of the world, consequently one required of him to carry the chart with the ten digital fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (its true name).
But when it arrived with the team of investigation towards corpse, it did not recognize it by its physical aspect, because this one was very different from that which he had seen in the media.
It did not have a barb, it was equipped like a peasant with the zone, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the digital fingerprints of the corpse with those of the chart.
Its eye did not mislead it not: it was about “Alfonso Cano”.
This same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the person in charge who confirmed to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader of Farc.
In search of the print
For a dactyloscopist of Sijín de Cali the recognition which president Juan Manuel Santos made in Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against “Cano”, is very significant.
Many people of do not know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Except for identifying the corpses, the dactyloscopists support the investigations for the offenses like the flight and the homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people.
When are captured, much delinquents present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their digital fingerprints and let us seek them in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of flight it had to remove part of wall of a house, because in this place the robber had supported his hand to make leave a safe full with jewels and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a digital fingerprint from it, but in this case we could obtain the print of all the hand and to identify with the delinquent who had taken part in various flights”, remembers it.
The prints can also draw aside or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently one found a man died, with drink bottles around him.
By interlude of the investigation one determined that a relative can be suspect crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if that No does not guarantee that he is the assassin, that places it on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopist of the CTI explained that one extracts “the digital fingerprints from the objects with chemical or physical reagents”.
When they appear, one uses a sampler or a band to take them.
Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the déclinquents, or with the National Civil Register.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers”, indicated the expert of the CTI.
He explained why all is not how one shows in the CSI television program.
As all that shines is not gold, very that one touches does not become forcing a print.
It can however be used, if one carries out confrontation necessary.
“Made indignant” the authorities in New York defy
Hundreds of demonstrators were hustled in front of the Zuccotti place to camp there.
Most of the people reached the order of evacuation and moved with a nearby park.
The integral ones of the movement Occupe Wall Street defied this Tuesday the authorities of New York while trying to enter again, thanks to a legal order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of Large Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were hustled in front of the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to reach thanks to a legal order which allows “made indignant” to camp again in this place, while the other share of the movement answered the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not enable us to camp again in the place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal fight to turn over to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations”, known as-a of the spokespersons of the movement “Occupe Wall Street”, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the answer of “made indignant” to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where judge Lucy Billings emitted an order which prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and made it possible to the demonstrators to remain in the camp
Moreover, “made indignant” occupied a new park located at the junction of the power stations Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very near to the entry to the Holland tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church.
At least during an hour they succeeded in occupying the place, but after the Police there moved and stopped some demonstrators, even if Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, by ensuring Efe owing to the fact that he saw some journalists to which one had also passed from the handcuffs.
The organization ensures that centenaries ago of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support with the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them owe the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place - which is an enclosure of private property - remains closed while waiting for the celebration of a legal audience envisaged by this Tuesday during which one must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some demonstrators moved until there increased and distributed to this hour of the copies of this legal kind and they delivered it even to the agents which supervised the place, which because “certain small confrontations”, Bray indicated, which denounced the fact that certain official the demonstrators struck.
The legal order prohibited with the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupies Wall Street or to apply “laws published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators from again reaching the park with tents or other properties which they used before”.
The Bloomberg mayor indicated in front of the press that, because of this legal order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the demonstrators, to which it however alerted owing to the fact that the local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and bags to sleep.
The town councillor personally defended the evacuation achieved by means of a paddle in the Zuccotti place, an operation during which one stopped 200 people and who was decided because of fact that the demonstrators “violated the law”.
Bloomberg explained that it had given the order to evacuate the place because this one became “a place in which the people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in certain cases, to make evil with other people”, because “certain stores had received threats” and the residents were afraid “for their quality of life”.
“The evacuation of this morning at dawn was feeling reluctant and shows that in the Bloomberg bottom is more interested to defend the financial interest than those of the American workers”, the spokesperson of the movement added, which showed the mayor “not to respect freedom of expression”.
The persons in charge of “Occupe Wall Street” also stated that they do not think of organizing “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with the Community organizations and the trade unions to commemorate the two months of protest, which began on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Christmas
Beside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, it will leave in the television program “It' s.a. Russell Peters Christmas” the next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in “Home Improvement”, first-aid worker in “Baywatch”, rabbit in “Playboy”, marries of the musician of rock'n'roll Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Christmas of Canadian television.
The private channel of television CTV announced today that Anderson, beside the “crooner” (wandering entertainer) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, will leave in the television program “It' s.a. Russell Peters Christmas” the next December 1st interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed today images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the full diffusion on Internet of a pornographic video private in which it appeared with her husband of this time, the beater of “Mötley Crüe”, Tommy Lee, appears equipped like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a headstock which represents in Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin which presented recently part of “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” of Charlie Sheen, seems Joseph.
Beside Anderson and Peters, the special program of Christmas of CTV introduces also the Canadian singer Bublé, who at at the end of March married in Buenos Aires models it Argentinian Luisana Lopilato, and which is not itself not far from the controversies.
Recently, Bublé called “whore” American Kim Kardashian during one in her concerts in New York.
Japan reappears after the earthquake
The GDP raises one 1.5% thanks to consumption domesticates and puts an end to the spiral of fall of the the beginning of March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, convalescent still after the devastator earthquake who became nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second world war.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses to 300,000 dollars million, a blow which, in spite of the difficult world context, seems to be attenuated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross domestic product between July and September were used for to make a fresh start definitively: the GDP raised one 1.5% compared to the former quarter and one 6% in calculated on a yearly basis rate.
That recorded the second quarters - for Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - supposes, moreover, largest puts rhythm into of rise since the period from January to March 2010.
Recovery is explained, partially, by the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore the zones devastated by the earthquake and the posterior tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments per 1.1%, compared to the fall of the 0.9% of the expenditure of capital observed from January to March, the first retreat after six months of not-stopped rise.
However, truth stimulate Japanese economy is not exclusively based on the impulse Keynesian which invites to benefit from the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow of zero.
Japan awoke especially thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, which currently accounts for the 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable raised one 1%, pushed by the rise in the expenditure on vehicles, voyages and activities of entertainment.
The mark of the yen
Tokyo went back to the interior market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the “blue-chip stocks” elected by the investors who flee the crisis of the debt in eurozone and the turbid forecasts of the States Unies, a privilege which weighs like a flagstone in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With divided the stronger, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic line of undulation is determined by the health of the great technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made responsible for their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
“It is necessary to follow the risks which persist, like the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen”, announced yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Co-operation and Economic development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of the member countries presented in September clearer signals of economic deceleration.
The indicator which anticipates the points of inflection of the worldwide economy highlighted that principal the powers are braked.
Because this one lowered four decimals up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone even was under average, which is in level 100, N lowering eight decimals up to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds the doubts again
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the started peripheral allowances for risk and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, continuous Greece to get mixed up itself in the labyrinth which leads to the exit of the great crisis of the European debt.
The feeling of the “consensus” of the new Transition government Helene is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels that with a real conviction of the political forces starts to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos announced yesterday that there is not alternative for reform structural and that the one hundred days period establishes in its designation will be can be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party Nouvelle Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that it was not going to support the new austerity measures to in no case and reiterated his requirement of new elections for date envisaged, that February 19th.
“The principal task of this Government is that to apply the decisions of the top of October 26th”, Papadimos declared when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate which will finish tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reforms it disciplinary code of the civils servant and new measurements against tax avoidance will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras No releases the doubts about its position: “We committed ourselves helping the Transition government, but we engaged with nothing more”.
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than EU and the IMF, the organizations which must resolve the 8,000 million that Athens requires with urgency, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of commitment of realization of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by impacts caused by go-all of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not resolve the assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the principal parties hellenes as early do not sign “a commitment written without ambiguities as possible”.
The spokesperson of the Economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would go back “very quickly” to Athens to discuss with the new Government “the elements necessary to pay the sixth slice” of 8,000 million, even if it does not have a final date there either.
The Greeks have to make still much.
The Sofía Queen: “They are instruments for progress and the hope”
The Queen underlines the “dominating” place of Spain with regard to this kind of finances
Spain “reached a dominating place on a world level in the role of Microphone-finances”.
The Sofía Queen pointed out that the country became in these two last decades the second donor of planet with regard to this instrument of co-operation whose “petrol” resides in the fact that this one is a “instrument for the social progress, justice and the hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being”.
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World summit of the Microloan with Valladolid with the certainty that “there is no doubt” that this kind of operations are “absolutely essential” to achieve the Goals of the Millenium establish by the United Nations for 2015, and, “very especially, in that which has as drank the reduction with half of the volume of the people who live with incomes under a dollar per day, to which is fixed the “poverty line”.
Continuous Spain “to work” to increase the network of recipients “in all the corners of planet, and assumes this task with “responsibility”, announced the Sofía Queen, who hoped that initiatives and the contributions origins during the Summit, which will be prolonged until Thursday, “guarantee the creation of new capacities and opportunities better for poorest and especially for the women”, principal the recipients of these loans.
We “reached many objectives” and “we cope with many challenges”.
The Summit of the Microloan is considered not only like a for of debate, but also as the platform from which it is necessary to impel “two basic goals”.
Thus, Its Majesty explained why the objective is that at the end of 2015 there is 175 million poor families which reached at these financial services and which hundred million these families leaves the poverty line in which they live now.
The impulse in the design of the microloans in Spain and in the rest of the world “followed the initiated path it there has a few years in a manner pionnière” by Muhammad Yunus, underlined the Sofía Queen like a “act of justice and recognition due”.
And it described the father of this instrument as a “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty”, the work of which it knows since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her policy of loans.
This experiment was followed one year later by the first World summit to Washington and other meetings like those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “with each meeting I could note a continuous evolution”, explained Its Majesty, whose relationship to this project brought yesterday the qualifier of “head of the family to him” joined together to Valladolid on behalf of “banking of the poor”.
Finally, the Sofía Queen finished her intervention by encouraging the people present to take part in the debate and the research solution to advance in the fight against poverty.
“Imperative skinny”
The Minister for the External Business, Trinidad Jiménez, informed that solidarity “is a skinny requirement” for any democratic State.
In this direction, it stated that it would be an error of vinculer the co-operation with countries in the process of development at times of economic prosperity, because this one is a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez considered that the microloans suppose “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty”, and maintaining “more than ever” the governments of the developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not leave not that this one is the victim of compressions.
For Spain, the microloan is “one of the principal lines of co-operation for the development”.
The Secretary of State d' for International cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded “success” to give “confidence” excluded people to the “to which all leaven the door”\; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of Riva, welcomed the people present in a city which “opens its contaminated doors of the interdependent spirit”.
CDU proposes to elect the European president by the universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Union Christian Democrat (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, proceeded without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the party Christian Democrat.
The future of Europe was not initially envisaged with the program but was essential on the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who judge the policy of the government too much laxist with respect to the Greeks today and perhaps of the Italians tomorrow.
Motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted with the quasi-unanimity.
On 1001 deputy, only nine voted against and ten abstained from.
Standing ovation of several minutes to which had right, at the conclusion of their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave place to the doubt.
The idea-mistress of the chancellor - and motion - holds in a slogan: the answer to the crisis “is not less Europe but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe, it is peace but because “nine million employment depends directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, “time came from an opening to Europe”.
That could result in modifications with the treaty of Lisbon making it possible to reinforce the control of the European Union on the budget policies of the countries of the euro zone, but that could also lead to the election of the president of the European Commission by the universal suffrage “in order to give a face to Europe”.
Such is in any case one of the proposals of motion adopted by the congress whose inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Admittedly, it is not very probable that the Twenty-seven ones agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is hostile there and the leaders of CDU believe it that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the stake is posed.
In the same way, the delegates rejected with one crushing majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the directory of the European Central bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted reinforcing the weight of Germany.
Anxious to alleviate the climate inside her party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and with Helmut Kohl But she either did not seek to gain her congress on the back of the “small” European countries or the prompt countries in difficulty of criticizing arrogant Germany.
If motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of “the Franco-German friendship”, Angela Merkel did not evoke France.
Except in hollow.
By recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the middle of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of more humiliating defeats of the Napoleonean army.
What represents the fraud with the stops disease?
After the allowances, UMP and the government launch the offensive on the stops disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a Family Social Benefit Office, and to make a speech on the topic - recurring since 2007 - fight against the social frauds and the assistantship.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a will to save money in a context of rigor, but is not heralding an axis the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to concentrate on the stops disease.
Initially with an aim of budgetary economies: the government plans to impose to the employees of private fourth day of deficiency before the assumption of responsibility of a sick leave.
In light, without specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measurement which is likely to cause anger, but which would make it possible to bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measurement, of range plus symbolic system: to impose to the civils servant one day of deficiency not compensated in the event of sick leave (they do not have up to now a waiting period, against three days in the private one).
Whereas these questions are under discussion, the majority also starts again the set of themes of the frauds, targeting this time the abuses related to the sick leave.
“Controls will be much more important and, moreover, if you are taken, you will refund”, Xavier Bertrand with the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13 informed.
As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the frauds to the sick leave.
This one indeed been the object since 2002 of a continuous follow-up and political offensives, which generally bore fruit.
French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us delay initially on the national figures.
According to the National bank of health insurance (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were delivered in 2006.
According to the Research institute and of documentation in health economics, the daily allowances accounted for in 2008 5% of the health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
On this sum, 46% related to the vacation maternity and occupational accidents, and 54% related to the stops disease, that is to say 6.2 billion euros.
And thus 2.5% of the health expenditure.
In 2010, the French knew on average 14.5 days of sick leave, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting group.
An average which hides unquestionable variations: another investigation, published in 2007 by the site of management of Monster.com career, showed that 75% of the 40,000 questioned French employees said not to have taken no day of stop disease.
Another study, this time of the Health insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of the stops disease were one duration lower than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days in one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When one compares them with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere with the sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of total absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% to the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud with the stops disease represents very little vis-a-vis the moonlighting.
As for the fraud, it reaches only one weak width.
Reinforcement of the legislation made since 2002 that controls are systematic on the stops disease of more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1.5 million controls, the CNAM noted that 13% of the 285,000 realized for stops of short time were “unjustified or too long”, that is to say 37,050 cases.
In the case of the stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, one counted 11% of cases “unsuited or unjustified” on 1.2 million, is 132,000.
On the whole, therefore 169,000 “unjustified” cases, on several million paid having had a stop disease.
A figure which represents face well little, for example, with that of the moonlighting.
According to the deputy UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the question in June, this one would account for 9 to 15 billion euros of tax shortfall a year, that is to say more than the total costs of the daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than the fraud with these last.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new program of adjustment to rectify its economy.
It is what Monday, November 14 the Prime Minister declared, Lucas Papadémos, before the Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to its government of union would not be enough to achieve this task.
“To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of budgetary adjustment”, the chief of the government declared, which made its first public speech with the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence at the Parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the time of the summit of the euro zone on October 27th will be the “principal one tries” new government, because the participation of the country in the euro zone “is concerned”, he added.
Consequently, Mr. Papadémos provided that the public deficit of the country will be tiny room “in the neighborhoods of 9%” of the GDP from here the end of the year, after having been of 10.6% in 2010 and of 15.7% in 2009.
The line refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-hand side, supported Monday the measures already approved to try to leave the crisis of the debt but prevented that its party would not begin on an additional austerity.
“We will not vote in favor of new measurements”, he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, Nouvelle Democracy.
He expressed agreement with the reduction objectives of the deficit and the debt, and of fight against the wastings but hostile with any policy which would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner in charge of the economic affairs and monetary, which prevented that the IMF and the EU would not resolve the loan of 8 billion euros necessary without written guarantee of all the parties that they would support measurements envisaged, Antonio Samaras answered that its word was enough and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize the euthanasia and the assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
The Canadians live in the refusal of death, according to the report of the Royal Company of Canada
As regards palliative care, the committee claims that the governments, institutions of health care, and the doctors work together to ensure of better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian company lives in the refusal of death.
Only 9% of the Canadians indeed agree to speak with their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and take measures for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Company of Canada, in which six experts connected to various fields took part, of which ethics, right and medicine.
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal Code in order to allow the assisted suicide and puts down it, when this choice is essential, near a qualified patient judged to make such a decision.
Of outset, the experts quote a recent investigation of Economist Intelligence Links, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of planet.
If Canada were classified there 10th, the study notes that “the medicalisation of death in Canada generated a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death”.
Médicalisation or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, bring back to us the experts elected by the Royal Company of Canada.
And in spite of the wish that have most Canadians to die in the house, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
As a whole, country, it is in Quebec that this rate is raised the most, with 86% of deaths occurring at the hospital.
On the delicate question of the euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which go against the position of the federal government, which already said not to want anything to change with the criminal Code concerning the euthanasia and the assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no proof that this decriminalisation involves abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of the euthanasia or the suicide assisted on nonqualified people or not agreeing.
On the contrary, affirmed yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, one would precisely find more cases of these overflows in the countries where the euthanasia and the assisted suicide are not legalized.
“The euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal”.
“The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal”, explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians favorable to the euthanasia
Let us recall that 85% of the Canadians already decided in favor of the euthanasia because they believe that it would at the end of the lifetime make it possible to the people to reduce their sufferings, according to a survey Angus Reid carried out in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing the euthanasia will not cause to send the message that the life of the elderly people or handicapped has less of value.
As for the people having practiced the assisted suicide, probed estimate at 41% that they should not be continued.
As regards maintenance or suspension of the care near a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
As, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest as it is indicated in the criminal Code that the withdrawal of the care for which there was a refusal legally validates is not criminal.
The committee of experts also asks that the health professionals are trained with the duty to respect a refusal of the care at the end of the lifetime, without fearing criminal continuations.
As regards palliative care, the committee claims that the governments, institutions of health care, and the doctors work together to ensure of better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
Lastly, as regards palliative or final sedation, already largely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the committee asks that she be considered, when she is not used to reduce to the physical pain, like euthanasia, and that she is prone to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Certain experts in the field of the right of health already issued reserves concerning the conclusions of the report of the experts of the royal Company of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, specialist in right of health, described as “extreme” the position of the expert signatories of the report, inter alia things because it does not limit the practice of the euthanasia to the patients in final phase.
“That opens the door to a situation where each and everyone which would be tired life and which would have more than 18 years could require so that one help it to commit suicide”, to Me Deschamps says, which had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Me Deschamps also underlines that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values which take part in social fabric of the company.
However, “in company, he says, there are beacons and constraints”.
The specialist in the right of health Margaret Somerville as expressed “a strong opposition” to the conclusions of the report, as it described as “manifesto pro-euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is itself member of the Royal Company of Canada, disputes in particular the data of the report as for the absence of abuse in certain countries where the euthanasia and the assisted suicide are legalized, that is to say in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan invites president Assad to leave the power
Damas denounces a “plot”
Syria is insulated more and more
Partisans of Bachar Al-Assad expressed yesterday in front of the buildings of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Syria de Bachar Al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists to them and denounces a “plot” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damas while Turkey and Jordan, close to Syria, took a stand in favor of a departure of president Assad.
The king Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to invite president Bachar Al-Assad “to leave the power” in Syria where about forty civilians and members of the forces of the mode were still killed.
“If Bachar had in heart the interest of its country, it should resign, but it should also create the requirements for a new phase of the Syrian political life”, the king of Jordan said, adjoining country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the chief of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu deplored that the efforts of Turkish mediation undertaken since the beginning of the year near the Syrian mode showed a failure.
“Those which are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave”, he declared, alluding to Syria, adjoining country with the regard of which Turkey adopts an increasingly hard line.
The United States is on their side happiness of a “reinforcement of the consensus against Assad and the intrigues of the Syrian mode”, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of the countries as Turkey adopt an increasingly hard tone” vis-a-vis repression in Syria, observed Mark Thunder, a spokesperson of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the mode perished in the area of Deraa, in the south of Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory of human rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished “during exchanges of gunfire and of ramming to the heavy machine guns with Jobar” in the city besieged of Homs, according to this ONG.
At the time of a press conference, the Syrian Minister for the Foreign affairs Walid Mouallem however estimated that the country “moved towards the end of the crisis”.
It highly reacted besides to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damas of its work, which constitutes according to him “a dangerous step”.
Syria “will not bend”, he added, ensuring that “the plots warped against Syria will fail”.
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League studies now a “protection mechanism of the civilians” and wishes 500 member sending of Arab organizations of the rights of the person, media and the military observers in the country.
The French Minister for the Foreign affairs Alain Juppé is also known as favorable to the sending of observers of UNO to help to protect the civilians from the repression of the mode which according to him is locked up in “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is planned tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the plan of way out of crisis decided on November 2nd and in particular envisaging the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities in the grip of the dispute and the release of the stopped demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for the Foreign affairs, Sergueï Lavrov, considered to be yesterday “incorrect” the decision of the Arab League, while China exhorted Syria to implement the plan of way out of crisis, while taking care not to support possible sanctions against Damas.
Italy
Monti requests time from the markets and sacrifices with the Italians
The future chief of the Italian government, Mario Monti, claimed a little time at the markets to train his team and to implement a program, which will contain “sacrifices”, in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the government Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner was under discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the trade unions and employers.
It should set up a relatively restricted cabinet composed technocrats external at the Parliament.
“Monti spoke about an important program with much of sacrifices”, said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the many parliamentary small groups engaged in the talks, after having met the president of the indicated Council.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part says to expect that Mario Monti requests from here at Friday a vote of confidence at the Parliament to make sure that the new government has a sufficient support.
The consultations will end in the presentation by Mr. Monti of a short list, undoubtedly of a dozen ministers, with the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bond-holders yesterday, in their asking for time.
In “democracy, there are precise times” to prepare a government and its program, he underlined, thinking “unquestionable that the markets will be patient and understand”.
Its designation by the president had been initially greeted by the markets, but concern took again the top in particular after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in euro zone in September.
Indicated the Prime Minister should constitute a team including technocrats especially, even if it stressed that it would like to include “policies there”.
The new government must last until 2013, date of next legislative, he estimated.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain the confidence of the Parliament by Friday.
Mr. Monti engaged, once entered in function, to work in the urgency and an aim which Italy “becomes again protagonist” in Europe.
A spokesperson of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that “even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change”.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balance in the budget in 2013 in spite of the adopted plans of austerity these last months, in particular asked for new measurements of rigor.
The “owner of the Italian owners” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it Tuesday, also insisted on the need for starting again the economy, “because a country which does not have growth cannot respect the parameters of deficit”.
Mr. Monti, famous for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a “change of time” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, the “professor” symbolizing “the challenge of serious” and “other Italy”, according to the leader-writers.
The big unknown will be the longevity of its team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid anticipated elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.
A Russian scientist helped with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, affirmed an ONG Monday American specialized in the atomic risk.
The Institute for science and international security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International agency for atomic safety (IAEA) and other documents emanating of this agency of UNO to identify this researcher.
The IAEA informed last week of its “serious concerns” as for a “possible military dimension” of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing largely from documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked during three decades as from the Sixties in a Soviet military nuclear center with Tcheliabinsk (the Ural), and would have been implied in the synthetic diamond manufacture per explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to establish a company producing of “nano-diamonds” in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of its company would have led it to contact the embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He would have then cooperated with the Iranian program of 1996 to 2002, before his return in Russia.
In his last report, the IAEA evokes “strong indications that the development by Iran” of a nuclear system of detonation “was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew well this technique, but which, as a Member State informed the Agency of it, worked during the essence of its career on this technology within the military nuclear program of its country of origin”.
The crimes and offenses anti-Muslims increased by 50%
The crimes and offenses against the Muslims increased of almost 50% of 2009 to 2010, whereas in same time, other violences racial and religious slightly dropped or little progressed, according to the statistics of the FBI made public Monday.
According to these figures, the full number of the violences perpetrated against the Muslims passed from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is to say 49% of increase, against a progression of 13% of violences against the catholics, a fall of 4% of the infringements against the Jews and a total rise of 14% of the crimes and offenses anti-monk.
The full number of “crimes of hatred” very slightly increased to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% moved by differences in race and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is perturbing to see these crimes and offenses to increase again”, the organization of the human rights Human rights First underlined, “the increase in violences antimusulmanes is particularly significant”, the organization in an official statement added.
“Human Rights First stressed a long time that violences against the Muslims, like all the forms of heinous crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of the human rights”, one of the persons in charge of the organization, Paul Legendre adds.
“The US government can and must make more to attack these abuses”, he adds, estimating that could pass by an improvement of the police reports on the “crimes of hatred”.
The “crime of hatred” in the American federal right is a heritage of the time of the fight for the civic rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violences related to the race, the color of the skin, the religion, the origin and maintaining the membership sexual.
Twitter modifies its platform and resembles Facebook more
The site of Twitter microphone-blogging introduced Monday changes into the presentation of its platform, to make it possible in particular to its users to observe the activity of those which they follow, which makes resemble its service a little more that of Facebook.
A new mitre “activity” and another “name” make it possible to follow legibly, live the activity of the other “Twittos”, the Net surfers which one follows the messages (“tweets”) and those which follow you.
That makes it possible to know if they make follow messages, if they subscribe on new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc
This new formula of Twitter was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before being diffused with the whole of the network Monday, indicated to AFP the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its not very instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to repeat a message of someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) bringing happiness initiates, opens thus to a larger audience with a handling more comparable with that of the networks general public Facebook and Google+.
On the network, the users discussed with blow of “tweets” distinct on the interest of this innovation.
“It is useless, invading, and that resembles too much Facebook”, writing @jemb123.
“The Activité functionality will help me with better following certain elements of my Twitter flow”, sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inscription of “a budgetary gold rule” in the constitution
The government of large social democrat coalition/Christian Democrat with the power in Austria decided Tuesday to register in the constitution “a budgetary gold rule” in order to reduce the public deficits and thus to avoid a possible degradation by the credit rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the social democrat chancellor Werner Faymann who even announced to him this decision at the conclusion of a Council of Ministers, whereas the Austrian national debt is of 74.6%, largely above criterion of 60% maximum fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht, but clearly below the debts of country like Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If the solvency of Austria were lowered only one notch, AAA with AA+, should pay us three billion euros of interests in more each year”, argued the vice-chancellor and minister Christian Democrat of the Foreign affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria gives thus following a request of the top in Brussels of the member countries of the euro zone of October 26th: the heads of state and government had then claimed the inscription by the end of 2012 of the reduction of the public deficits and one return to the balance of the public accounts in the constitution or a of the same law value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the “German model”, Germany having been the first European country to adopt such “a rule”.
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease each year of 0.75% of the Gross domestic product (PIB) and, starting from 2017, the public deficit structural of the Federal state will not have to exceed each year 0.35% of the GDP, while the Regional states as well as the communes will have to present budgets to balance.
The objective is to make pass at horizon 2020/21 the national debt under the criterion of 60% fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht.
Strong yen
Noda threatens of a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese the Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, prevented Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to go up.
“We will intervene as we did the last time if we note an excessive volatility” in the rate of exchange of the yen, explained Mr. Noda with the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen went up not far from the historical levels which pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
This day, Tokyo massively sold yens against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just established a new record of strength since 1945 vis-a-vis the dollar.
But the yen regularly went up since, doped by purchases of investors who regard it as a “blue-chip stock” in these dubious times of world economic deceleration and of crisis of debt in Europe.
The dollar passed by again Tuesday under the 77 yens and the euro is descended under the symbolic mark from the 105 yens, near the levels having started the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar dimensioned around 120 yens and the euro more than 160 yens.
This blaze of the Japanese currency harms exports of the archipelago because it increases the cost of the Made products in Japan and reduces the value of the incomes drawn from abroad by the Japanese companies, when they convert them into national currency.
“Japan fights to be rebuilt” since the earthquake and the tsunami of March 11th which devastated the area of Tohoku (north-eastern), underlined Mr. Noda who fears that this increase in the yen does not kill in egg the fragile one recovery.
The third world economic power joined again with the growth with third quarters -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound of exports and household consumption leaded by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister judged that the dearness of the yen did not reflect “the fundamental economic ones of Japan”.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for its part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two days meeting of its council of monetary policy, to take all the possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the assistant governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, prevented that BoJ had already taken “the appropriate measures”, making it clear that no additional monetary easing was to be waited Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing house increased by 5,000 billion yens (47 billion euros) its purchases of bills Treasury, making pass to 55,000 billion yens (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts which it devotes to the purchases of various financial titles to flood the market of liquidities.
Euro zone:
the rates climb, the Stock Exchanges give out
The risk of contagion of the crisis of the debt always undermines the European indices.
In spite of the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better figures of growth in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue their rise.
Always worry for the stability of the euro zone, the European Stock Exchanges are inserted a little more in negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10:00, CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With the new tensions on the outputs of the loans of the States of the euro zone in difficulty, the markets of actions throughout the world continue to return part of their recent profits”.
“The investors, highly-strung persons, are only too conscious of the risk of contagion”, explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
Tokyo Stock Exchange enclosed in fall of 0.7%, suffering in its turn of fears renewed of the speakers of the market about the capacity of Europe to contain the crisis of the debt.
“Japan, as the rest of the world, has the eyes rivetted on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as long as the investors will not have an evidence that the situation is stabilized”, estimates Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewal of concerns on the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its fall Tuesday.
The euro evolves on its low level since one month and half.
Around 10:00, the European currency is worth 1.3570 dollar, in fold of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it moved back after the party of the chancellor Angela Merkel, CDU, joined together in congress Monday, adopted a motion in particular envisaging the possibility for a country in difficulty in leaving the euro zone without to leave the European Union.
Italian rates and Spanish well beyond 6%
The rates of loan of Italy and Spain remain on very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the output of the Italian obligations at 10 years reaches 6.85%, that of the Spanish titles of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to feed fears of the speakers.
The chief of the future Italian government Mario Monti claimed time at the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened of asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, affirmed to him that the implementation of the decisions taken at the time of the summit of the euro zone on October 27th would be the “principal one tries” of its government.
Spain finds itself in the line of sight of the markets, whereas are held Sunday of the legislative elections in the country.
The variation of rate (” spread “) between the obligations at 10 years of Germany and Spain reached a new higher history.
In waiting of the figures of growth of the euro zone
Side statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% with the third quarters, that is to say a little better than the 0.3% expected, carried by the household consumption.
INSEE however revised downwards the figure of the second quarters, with a passing of 0.1% of the Gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And, it is truly the fourth which worries more the economists.
Germany, on its side, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole of the euro zone is expected 11:00, whereas the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must override the dogmas
If it is an issue which one cannot cover starting from considerations of short-term or under the blow of L " emotion, it is well the energy policy.
The availability and the cost of L " electricity influence directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is healthy that an appointment electoral is the occasion to think on such challenges and the place that holds the nuclear power to with it.
The debate will be profitable only if it explores the whole of the economic consequences, social and environmental of the options suggested.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Whereas we are 7 billion D " beings human on planet, L " demographic trends will involve by 2050 a doubling of the request D " electricity, unless depriving an enormous part of the world population of a vital element.
In same time, it will be necessary to mitigate the rarefaction of the fossil resources to continue to permanently produce L " electricity, without forgetting the pressing need for reducing the gas emissions for greenhouse effect to fight against the climatic disordered state, a subject disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up the nuclear power.
It is the case neither of Belgium, which subjects his to the need for being able to find a source of replacement able to be substituted, nor of Switzerland, which just intends more not to build but power stations of last generation.
Contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, them, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by taking again the construction of a power station stopped after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, centered on renewable energies, is sometimes presented like an example, reality opposes the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the increase in the price of L " electricity, an energy dependence worsened by the recourse increased to imported gas, in particular of Russia, a jump of the CO2 emissions pulled by the construction of power stations to gas and coal.
In a few months, the whole of these annoying effects are already made feel.
The case of Denmark east to be meditated.
Champion of Europe of L " wind, of which it draws 30% from its electricity, it is also one of the largest gas and coal users because of intermittency of the wind\; under the terms of what, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors discharge an invoice D " electricity higher of 40% than that of the French households.
Whereas in a globalized economy the cost of L " energy constitutes a key factor of competitiveness and a pledge of the maintenance of the industrial tools on the national territory, the French companies profit from L " the least expensive electricity of Europe.
So any significant reduction on behalf of the nuclear power would generate a big rise of the price of L " electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.
A price that a vast majority of French refuse to pay, the more so as they do not express opposition of principle to this energy, the surveys show it.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct uses and 410,000 induced employment.
Strongly exporting, it involves a galaxy of SME specialized on the international markets and very creative of employment not délocalisables makes them.
If France had suddenly decided to leave the nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice a good amount of these SME by reducing like shagreen the 6 billion annual euros of French exports D " equipment and services nuclear.
Which electrician would order a EPR conceived to function sixty years whereas the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve L " energy equation, it should be admitted that there does not exist source of production D " electricity miracle, not more than there does not exist about it of diabolic.
The development by Areva of not very transmitting, nuclear and renewable CO2 solutions, testifies to the complementarity of the sources D " energy.
For the nuclear power, to maintain more the high level of safety is an absolute requirement.
We have in France an Authority of safety which exerts an intransigent and transparent control on the existing power stations as on the building site of Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited same obsession of safety.
In one half-century, nuclear industry knew three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under conditions of normal operating\; it remained without human consequence nor environmental.
In Tchernobyl, the design of the engine and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of a width without precedent which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
Nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as it had done for the two precedents.
Fruit of this approach and a co-operation between the authorities of safety, the owners and the manufacturers French and German, the EPR presents a design making it able to resist such phenomena.
Whereas he is considered by all the electricians eager to build a power station, the stop of its construction with Flamanville would be a splendid gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF in their leaving the free track to seize the leadership in the impossible to circumvent development of the nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave L " emotion, the dogmas and the operations well-wishers to also dominate a debate determining for the economic situation, social and financial of our country.
Is immigration a load or a chance for the economy?
The policy as regards immigration carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized under various angles - clogging of the police, legal and administrative services subjected to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the autoproclamé statute of “country of the human rights” of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassing whose the object the foreign students make who made the topicality, the Home Secretary (to read Libération of May 23rd) proclaiming on the way that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters of restaurant”.
But it only is seldom analyzed under the economic angle.
It is that there is on this subject a rather broad consensus between left and right-hand side.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that “900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country including nearly 2 million immigrant workers”, and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France “cannot accommodate all the misery of the world in 1990”.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left like on the right.
For the two edges, the immigrants are perceived like a load for the economy and the French company.
The only difference holds with the degree of generosity that one will condescend to grant with respect to the immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself with banalities, indicating that codéveloppement will allow to solve our “migratory problem”.
This idea of immigration like a load, a problem, is perhaps paying electorally\; but it is economically very expensive.
As point out it the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Future Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our, May 2011, Princeton University Close, 352 pp.), there exists a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact in the migratory flux on the economic growth, the wages and employment in the countries which receive immigrants.
To restrict immigration weakens the growth and harms employment.
Fears with respect to the impact of the migrants are founded on the idea that those are likely to replace the national workers, particularly the qualified little, putting pressure downwards on their wages.
But the experiment shows that, actually, the immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to the national employees, exerting essentially trades in sectors in shortage of employment.
The little qualified immigrants work in sectors which do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the formation does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on the wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country which knows a shortage of anesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and the use of the nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a rise of 1% of the migratory flux involves an increase ranging between 0.6 and 0.9% of the real wages in the long run.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the Nobel Prize American\; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were rested by immigrants).
The migrants are also net contributors of the social systems, on average to a total value of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The Worldwide organization of work estimates for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the 30 years age will make a clear contribution (receipts minus expenditure) of 150000 euros to the public budgets on average on the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of mandate, outward journey to seek the missing points of growth “with the teeth”.
The teeth in question, while being used to dissuade the immigrants, had the exact adverse effect.
Europe invented the democracy, remains to think the European democracy
The democracy is an invaluable good\; it is also a fragile good.
The continent of Europe should be able to remember it him who, to have invented it in Athens there is more than two thousand years, knew along 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some could believe that it would be enough, so that the democracy triumphed definitively over its enemies, to exert the vote, and to exert it in the most direct way which is.
One knows, since Napoleon “the Small one”, that it was a facility of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the requirement of the democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can be even made “instrument of oppression” as said formerly the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
Not, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, solidarity economic and social, a justice.
The crisis of Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is as much and initially a crisis of the policy and democracy.
The palinode of the truth-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect value of revealing double: that of the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic combat moved today, and that, for much of them, the republican soldiers do not draw any more in the right direction.
We do not have anything to gain to require a succession of national referendums, organized with the liking of the needs and in dispersed order.
A full power with the European absolute monarch or a jump with feet together in the vacuum of the nationalist fold: what a choice for the citizen!
Not, we do not want choppers but a exercise, commun run, automatically, serene and continuous, a choice and a democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - one would not know besides any more where to stop L " enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is very whole Europe which yields with the diktats of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its defect of solidarity.
It is very whole Europe which is humiliated on the international scene.
One worries about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - but it is very whole Europe which loses its sovereignty gently, and with it each one of its nations.
The urgency, it is to give again with popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together, which Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, to release themselves from the markets and to prepare the future while investing.
The way out of crisis will suppose decisions at the European level which could not be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, except of course leading us to the disaster.
After having a long time fought this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone claims the European economic government today.
That is to say.
But to think it without a political integration and democratic stronger, and lived like such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, republicans should “have been made”.
The Revolution in the interests could not be enough there.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe more integrated on the economic plan.
That could be done only by building more democratic Europe on the political plan, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
The smart cards “without contact” spread
The world show of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, close to Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should be indeed completed on a rise of 11% of the world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, telephone with SIM card…), with more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most carrying segment is that of technology without contact which makes it possible to pay public transport or to pay its purchases by simply approaching the chart of a reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold throughout the world, against 320 million one year earlier!
Their share should still progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market of the smart card (6.925 million charts).
A long time with the drag of the Asia-Pacific area, Europe gains ground for the payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards is already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 terminals of payment accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 charts without Visa contact were deployed.
But large surfaces put the twice the work.
Crossroads thus emitted this year 2.5 million charts Pass MasterCard without contact.
To pass at high speed, it is necessary from now on that the banks equip their customers.
“Two great French establishments began to diffuse in the future systematically with their customers of the bank cards equipped for without contact”, announces Gerard Nébouy, chief executive officer Visa Europe France.
The banks test the payment by mobile
But it is only one first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few apparatuses are equipped today with technology NFC (Near Field Communication) essential to carry out transactions.
“They were delayed”.
“But they should finally make true great strides the next year”.
“We count on the sale from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world”, explains Marc Bertin, president d' Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Agricultural credit announced yesterday the launching of a test from December to June next in Caen.
IPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case authorizing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a plan similar to Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the General society also said yesterday to prepare the marketing of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist face extends
Paris worries about the bonds between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Suspected of long time, the bonds between terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the sect Nigerian Boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian vice-minister of the Foreign affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even marked that Algiers from now on “became convinced of it”.
“The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is co-operation well”, he explained without more precision.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French in Niger last January would have put at the day of the footbridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by close relations of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory as several their kidnappers at the time of an operation launched by the French special forces were to be killed the following day at the same time.
In the debris of the intervention, the French investigators and natives of Niger were to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Center terrorist
The analysis of the last calls directs towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers interest the investigators particularly: one leads to a Native of Niger who remained lengthily in Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other with a man who says himself near to Aqmi and the sect.
“It is a projection but it is undoubtedly necessary to expect more formal evidence before speaking about operational co-operation between Aqmi and Boko Haram”.
“But it is possible”.
“One knows years since that the sect profits from supports financial and intellectual external and that it is shown more and more activates”, moderates Kunle Amuwo, an enquiring Nigerian.
These last months these “supports” had been increasingly obvious in the evolution and of the speeches of Boko Haram or in its procedures, which imply from now on the recourse to kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and of the same invoice than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, consequently put pressure on Abuja so that he takes into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities indeed a long time regarded the group as a community of enlightened not very worthy of interest.
A fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, of a school and iman fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa “Western education is a sin” - preaches the introduction of an Islamic emirate in the Moslem north of Nigeria.
In this poor area, association has fast success.
It politicizes and requires a strict respect of the charia while its militants engage the fight against the impious central government.
The latter aim initially the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram show themselves particularly active, multiplying the attacks against the police stations.
Reaction of Abuja east, as with its practice, without nuances.
The army invests the city, one counts 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, alive decree, are killed in prison.
Consequently the sect will radicalize and leave its strongholds of north.
In last Christmas, she claims the responsibility for attack which causes 80 deaths with Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram is caught some at the secure HQ of the police at the time of an attack commits suicide, its first.
In August, the local headquarter of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which would surf of Mauritania in Somalia via Nigeria worries from now on all the specialists in safety.
Whereas Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, that the Al-Chebab Somali operate in Kenya, Boko Haram seems a new threat in the middle of the continent.
Last week, during a maintenance in Nigeria with president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and was ready “to share all the information”.
The world according to the republican candidates with the presidency
On China, on Iran, the assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Hermann Cain, and Rick Perry compete of over-simplification and ignorance.
Can America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
To listen to the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Hermann Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied the thundering declarations and the short cuts as regards foreign politics, traditionally a republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, the assistance to Israel, the slogans - often not backed up - fuse.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race with the nomination of “Large Old Party”, threatened to trail the Chinese in front of WTO and to blame them “for handling of their currency”, a topic carrying in America exasperated by the migration whole pieces of its industry towards Asia.
Such an amount of worse if that must imply the release of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, ex-ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign politics, failed to strangle themselves vis-a-vis an attitude which “flatters” the emotions.
It called with a muscular but constructive dialog with Beijing (the current location of Obama).
But Huntsman, which stagnates in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
With the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikings on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he boasted.”
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase the military aid in Israel, showing Obama to fail in his obligations with respect to this partner.
The entrepreneur Hermann Cain, second candidate best placed, poster as for him an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, it invited to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “tries to develop a nuclear capacity” - apparently being unaware of owing to the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikings against Iran, is ready, as for him, to engage the American army in Mexico against the cartels of drug.
The recourse to torture against the alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama is recommended in 2009, also by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign politics.
The adversaries of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and that it gained the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that it had to put water in his wine as regards antiterrorism.
They insist with reason on the failure of its naive dialog with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the “servant boys” of Iraq, on its tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weak to him.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers rather positive the assessment of national security of Obama, who eliminated Bin Laden.
From Iraq, she is wary of the military interventions which lead to stagnation.
And, while asserting that it is necessary economically to rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes just.
North Stream, news carries ntrée of Russian gas in Europe
The Northern gas pipeline Stream, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia while passing at the Baltic sea-bed, entered in service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million hearths.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with glare.
More than 500 guests whose four heads of state and government took part, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine dresser, with the unveiling of North Stream, this new gas pipeline who connects directly, under the sea, Russia in Germany.
Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, French the Prime Minister Francois Fillon and her counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve ordering the entry of Russian gas in the Western-European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases will arrive each year to Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km linking the region of Saint-Pétersbourg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Poméranie.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, making it possible to on the whole deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is to say the equivalent of all French consumption.
And one evokes already the possibility of building a third of it on the same course.
For Gazprom, completion in time and hour of this enormous building site has airs of victory.
The project had been strongly disputed by Poland and the Baltic States.
Stream North indeed will make it possible to deliver gas directly in Germany, by avoiding any terrestrial passage by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little their power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to weigh on Russia while threatening to close the access to the Western-European markets to him.
With most extremely of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare Stream North with a “new pact germano-Soviet”, in reference to alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
It is to say if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, while supporting this Russian project, gained there a greater safety of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe of energy, since the project created a breach between Européens of the East and the West.
Russia knew, in five years hardly, to make triumph its vision over a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly consuming gas, and whose layers are declining.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which binds us in an organic way”, Francois Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing at which point the great gas contracts are as political as economic.
All that explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present of number with Lubmin, the point of gas connection.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploit.
The underwater tube is out of concrete steel sheathed in order to protect it from the anchors from the ships.
It rests on the sea-bed, to 200 m on average.
To build it, minefields should have been avoided dating from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by precaution”, indicates Jens Müller, spokesperson of the Northern company Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measurements to protect fauna and the flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing stops over all its length: neither valve, nor station of maintenance.
A platform of control was envisaged off Sweden, but the persons in charge of the project gave up it whereas the Swedes were not very eager to see a Russian company of State being established in a permanent way at broad their coasts.
“In the event of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than one minute”, Jens Müller specifies.
In the event of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus escapes in the air.
But this case is considered to be not very probable by the manufacturers who envisaged the weldings to know an escape every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, trailed by a ship, for the external observation, as by an apparatus which circulates inside the gas pipeline.
The shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, broad one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by gas.
On arrival, after three days complete of voyage at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers accurate information on the possible deformations of metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to function fifty years without having to undergo least repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is of 200 bars at the beginning, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies linked their forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
United there German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each one), as well as Dutch the French Gasunie and group GDF Suez (9% each one).
These five companies created a joint undertaking, named Northern Stream, asked to build and operate the gas pipeline.
It has its seat with Zoug, in Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then rented at this company, for twenty years renewable, the totality of the transport capacities of gas.
“Gazprom will pay for full capacity, whatever the quantity of gas really transported”, Jens Müller specifies.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was ensured 30% by the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total costs of work should reach the 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment was assembled to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to return in their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic with Lubmin, on a planted sandy littoral of pines.
Valves, high, 4.5 meters form the exit door of gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and specificities of the gas which arrives, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas at each hour which passes.
With full capacity, they will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskin, a notebook of mark.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskin wants to give again the taste of the writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent to write in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, its sheets of a color broken white, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook such as it today is known was born… in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at the time launching a report distinguished design but.
Maria Sebregondi, then consulting for the company, undertakes the launching of the new product.
The notebook takes as a starting point an old production technique, the mole skin (skin of mole) which indicates a cotton varnished used to cover benches for example.
This kind of notebook was very snuffed writers and travellers.
“Moleskin gave to the last style an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the artists avant-gardists, to the XX E century”, Maria Sebregondi tells, become since the person in charge of the mark at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26% to be established to 12.7 million past parts.
One is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskin exceeds the Italian borders and is exported in 70 countries, of France to the United States.
Difficult to establish an identikit picture of the purchaser, because the report allures as well the businessman as the student and the professionals.
With the image of Moleskin, its consumers cosmopolitan, open of spirit and are cultivated.
The Italian small company, which counted 12 employees at its beginnings, in account almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices\; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in the bookstores, of Fnac to the small shops of downtown area and knew to impose its identity.
“We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, in spite of the rise of e-mail”, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development by Moleskin: recently, the mark launched an exposure “Turning” where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, it also launched a cover in leopard, at the time of the Festival of film of Locarno.
Benefitting from its success and from this will have cultural, Moleskine knew to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, covers of computer… The mark is declined on a whole range of supports.
A success which made the envious ones: with the autumn 2006, Modo Modo was repurchased by investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskin.
Why the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remain does so high?
Approximately 19% of the handicapped people are in search of a work.
The 15th week for the employment of the handicapped people opens today.
In spite of a voluntarist public policy installation in 2005, the unemployment rate of the handicapped people is still twice higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the whole of the population.
Discouraging?
“Not, underlines Eric Blanchet, chief executive officer of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of the handicapped people. ”
“Good progresses for fifteen years have been considerable. ”
“At the time, unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. ”
“It still enormously remains nevertheless to make. ”
It should be said that for the handicapped unemployed, the obstacles remain numerous before reaching employment.
They are rather old: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a qualification level relatively low: 80% do not have the vat and on the 2.3 million students of higher education, 10,000 only are handicapped.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the handicapped people, against 38% on average.
In short, as many criteria which complicate the return to employment singularly, and which “constitute the node of the problem”, according to Christian Grapin, chief executive officer of Springboard, an association created to help the companies in 1992 to recruit handicapped workers.
Here are for the objective brakes.
Remain the unvoiced comment, mentalities which evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by association IMS-To undertake for the City indicated that the questioned managers have “a low level of knowledge of the handicap”, with a “over-representation of the people in wheelchair, defective psychic the or intellectual ones”.
Result, the private companies of more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of use of 6% of handicapped workers, fixed in a law of… 1987.
The last known figures, which go back to 2008, mention a ratio of 2.6%.

“But this improvement translates also a true awakening, in particular in the great groups. ”
According to the ministry for employment, only 59% of the establishments from 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, against 82% of the companies from 100 to 199 employees.

Very trustful Portugal
Portugal de Paulo Bento starts with much optimist his stopping return vis-a-vis Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
With the outward journey, the two teams had missed realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country”.
Paulo Bento sees itself there already, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the shade of a doubt, Selecçao, of which it is with the levers since September 2010, will be qualified for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only at 90 minutes of happiness.
But there are a match to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to unbolt.
Within sight of the match outward journey (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears obvious that the games are not played.
Portugal dominated the part during more than one hour, certainly, but it was unable to mark this so invaluable goal, which would have relieved it.
“It is a good performance, which involves however a certain risk because we did not mark of goal outside”
But on their premises, in their luminous Stage of Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public which should be there too ebullient, even if the part obviously announce themselves “very tight”, dixit optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced to be able to get the upper hand”, the trainer Portuguese 42 years declared.
“We continue to have 50% of chances to be with the Euro 2012”, nevertheless the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
No one paid Friday of Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and gain.
No one can be enough in Bosniens, which needs also to mark.
“It is a good performance, which involves however a certain risk because we did not mark of goal outside”, Bento regrets.
“We will play against a team which has many technical qualities and which lays out players with many individual qualities”, he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put of entry a maximum of pressure on Bosniens in order to “not give them time to reflect. ”
A good idea, on condition that being realistic, this time.
