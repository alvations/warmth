Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in the euro zone are the headline inflation rapidly rising prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the rise in November was higher than expected, after the 2.6% in October an annual rate of inflation has been noted by 3.1%, as the Statistical Office of the EU in Luxembourg.
Official predictions are of only 3%, and reported.
In contrast to the American, British, Canadian Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced Leitzsins. Her discretion after the consistency of the rising prices of raw materials and the slight fall in unemployment would promote the creation of a Inflationsspirale.
The ECB is trying to keep the rate of inflation below 2%, or at least less than in the two per cent brand.
According to a analysts the ECB was caught deny: we must inflation ', in order to avoid future action.
With 3.3%, the rate of inflation reached in November in Germany a twelve-year Rekordhoch; in Spain, the rate of 3.6 kletterte to 4.1%.
Responsible for the increase in the rate of inflation in the euro area increased food and energy prices.
The the MATIF-Weizennotierungen rose by 88%, and of course for soya beans also reached a Rekordhoch since 1973.
In oil and dairy products, there has been a considerable rise in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52% this year - reached last month, the price per celebration of the black gold almost 100 US dollars.
The ECB, the inflation in the year 2008 will rise from 2.1 to 2.5%, but it is with a reduction in 2009 to 1.9%.
For the coming 3-4 months analysts are starting from a 3% rate of inflation, quantify the annual Durchschnittsrate but with 2.1%.
For 2008 experts anticipate that the ECB will cut interest rates twice.
Government crisis Gallup ortet
For a long time been stagnation in the number of human-sympathisers has grown considerably by the beginning of December, since 2002, the first party has the greatest base, while the support of the Socialists Gallup according to an unprecedented low by 13%.
In the party faithful voters the difference, thanks to the determination of the Oppositionsbefürworter is clear: more than two-thirds (71%) face a fifth (20%) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey SZDSZ MDF and are under the parliamentary Einstiegshürde: they have come in on two per cent of the total population.
The number of Parteiwähler has grown in both camps at a rate of 1%.
In comparison with the last low point of the general economic mood has further deteriorated - never before the proportion of those who (to assess the economic situation of the country as' very poorly ', as high was 41%), while another 46% they consider' quite bad '.
After hoffnungsvolleren prospects in the spring and summer, the families see a change in their financial situation myself once again.
For next year, the majority of the population is calculated on a further deterioration in the situation; only a tenth of comes from a recovery.
In December and carried out a Gallup survey showed that 71% of the respondents - a historic here - the work of the Prime Minister, sees as' as a rather bad '.
13% of the respondents have great faith and confidence in general, Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the percentage of those in favour of Viktor Orbán 38% represents.
EUR 54% do not trust the Head of Government, compared to 27% of distrust against the leader of the human rights.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that we could dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister, even without a change of government.
After the unrest had voted last October 35% for the maintenance of the government and of the Heads of Government, this figure is today to just 20%, while the relative majority (33%), the only solution in new elections.
In its interest in the referendum of 60% said that they 'to participate with security', and that another 20% would be their vote 'probable'.
By way of comparison, the parliamentary elections were to be held this Sunday, would go only 55% 'security' to the ballot box, another 15% keep their participation for 'probable', in view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be unpredictable.
74% would be against the tuition fees, 79% against the Praxisgebühr, and 84% against the hospital-Taggeld.
The integration of the group of the referendum 'safety' participants the shares of the opponents of the study, as practical and would even be Krankenhausgebühren 81 to 84, or 89%.
The most expensive Auchan, Tesco, increased by almost a fifth
In the Hypermarkets Budaörser Handelsgebiet also have this year, the average increase in price of 16% last year, with the difference that it this year no increase in VAT.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the price of the usual Budaörser Handelsdreieck Weihnachtskorbes has the 'Napi' also increased 16% this year, but in all Hypermärkten prices have been recorded over 1000 HUF.
After the prices in the Lebensmittelmärkten last December 'davongaloppiert', which is not prozentuell rise drastically, compared with the already high, former initial level.
However, it is intended as a deterrent to the consumer that what they had paid last year far below 9 000 HUF, this year, not even for 10, 000 HUF available.
The price of the 'Napi' Warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10 000-HUF-border at least 91 HUF investigated in the markets.
The high price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The price of fish were almost Unicum and living on Vorjahresniveau, greatly increased prices for Putenbrustfilets, and on the other hand, are Nuss poppy.
Prices for bread flour, and in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, there have been Auchan 1kg Brotwecken for 139 Ft.
There was no competition-related decline in the product to below 200 Ft.
It is also surprising here two, the price of a litre of Coca-Cola Pfandflasche from 200 Ft was, therefore, including the drink deposit cost only HUF 257.
Nevertheless, this year in the 'Napi' Warenkorbs-comparison Auchan raised the most expensive, and Cora most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora prices have in the 'Napi' shopping basket Weihnachtspreisen last year with the 15, while each Auchan Tesco and increased by 18%.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of last year and this year was the most expensive of 12%, while the increase between billigstem shopping basket of last year and the current year teuerstem representing 21%.
The average price rises 1.480,00 HUF was.
The average increase in the last year was still 1.206,00 Ft, however, the Mehrwertsteuererhöhung price was last Christmas.
It is precisely this process has taken the trade furiously: it would seem that the Warenhäuser could not decide what Preisspanne should apply in the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in the consumption have incalculable.
(If the dealer does the circulation of a product bad, it can fall by a substantial profits in the Preisspanne, after the Verkehrsintensität.)
Mehwertsteuer-the rise of the 'Napi' Warenkorbes last year was so radical that the most expensive element was the value of 2006 by 1720 Ft exceeded, whereas the price difference in the cheapest merely basket 844 Ft.
This year, have not been observed such extremes, since the most expensive basket 1.630,00 Ft to cost more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was an increase of 1.284,00 Ft.
In comparison with the last two Weihnachtssaisons was a disastrous increase, the price of day-to-day consumer article in the Hypermärkten has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30%.
(confirmed this once again not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic the Statistical Office in the period of 12 months, found a more than 30% rise.
So in addition to flour in around in eggs.)
However, you look into the 'Napi' shopping basket, it seems almost impossible to pursue, because the price level of last year expensive product itself has risen in the worst case, little more than 10%.
Obviously Mehllieferanten are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - after all, they were able to pass the drastic increase in prices to the multinationals.
In the golden Handelsdreieck aren't complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three Warenhäusern do not look more on prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, sustainable food goes on Paletten on the Ladentische.
Wednesday morning there was in all three Warenhäusern endless queues in the Kassa when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
Nevertheless, it is reported by the country a smaller Kundenfrequenz, so many multinationals in the Meinungsforschern complain that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, and not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places Desinfektionsmitteln cuts in
Today, more than a thousand have been registered infections in hospitals, which were due to the improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding in the beds, congestion of staff, factors which are not conducive to combat the infection, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums.
Cuts are being made in many places in the Desinfektionsmitteln.
In the Traumatologie-department of a hospital János MRSA-infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant pasteurisation has been found in a male patients, was taken after a serious accident to hospital.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection.
The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital, shortly afterwards, the man who had to return with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could be because of the Bakteriums since that is still in the body of the patients, carried out.
Until 10 December this year to the National Nosocomialis infections generated from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant strains reported Surveillance System, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, through multi-resistant strains caused infections were to be registered in the hospitals in security, but the number of unreported cases is higher.
Approximately two-thirds of the infection (683 cases) the MRSA, triggered against Methicillin-Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The pasteurisation Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is approximately one-third of people in their nose, without it would cause a disease.
SA-related infections (such as Halsentzündung, Mandelentzündung, inflammations of skin or wounds) usually respond to antibiotics, they are good it can be cured.
However, the funds be extent too high or inadequately applied, antibiotic-resistant, which are under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly arise from the good respondierenden bacteria.
Particularly in patients with geschwächtem, or permanently bad funktionierendem immune system, but also in older, or patients with little weight these bacteria can serious infections, such as Blutvergiftung Wundinfektion or, in other words Sepsis.
The head of the medical János hospital, the MRSA-infection is nothing special that such incidents are Krankehausalltag.
We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor MRSA Nyulasi - there are not only there, where they will not be sought.
Become resistant to antibiotics
'such patients are isolated, and health care personnel bears Gummihandschuhe and masks of supplies, and we have the necessary for the treatment of antibiotics' - so Tibor Nyulasi.
In its Einlieferung hospital patients to be investigated MRSA, however, not always an infection can be avoided.
Rarely Probenentnahmen to
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals, would be avoided, however, the current conditions and conditions are unfavourable to the control of the creation or the spread of the virus multi-resistant, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection in hospitals and Altersheimen occurs, should the eingelieferten Spitäler MRSA-infected patients investigate and isolate immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals microbiological practice not, however, being so often.
Not least because it on the part of the state Krankenkasse, no subsidies for this study.
The majority of cases, therefore, only then will come to light, if a patient is already a bemerkbare MRSA-infection, the head of the medical Epidemiologiezentrums.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic treatments should be targeted, that is to say, microbiological studies are necessary, so that there are no resistance against the resources, however, this directive will be respected by hospitals, not always.
Under the ambulanten, or in the service of the patients microbiological Probenentnahmen are even less so Karolina Böröcz.
In the Desinfektionsmitteln savings
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA patients from one to the other will be entrusted to most of nursing staff.
That is precisely why the Händewaschen, or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, however, there are also serious shortcomings in this area in the hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact in the domestic hospitals do not always have the possibility, however, to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are often overcrowded, ranked the beds close to each other, although it should be epidemiological point of view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
As Karolina Böröcz points out, it is, unfortunately, in the less well financially the hospitals even that savings would be made on Desinfektionsmitteln, there are few managers, many patients - all factors that encourage the emergence of infection.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently, or can be stopped the further spread of the virus, where these protective measures are complied with, Karolina Böröcz.
Emphasising MRSA against
MRSA-infections to manage the health insurance caused enormous costs, so they will be combatted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their containment was recorded in the legislative programme.
After the first signs of the programme is successful, as publizierte show data, the trend of MRSA-infections in England is falling.
The European Centre for disease prevention (ECDC)), the prevention of the creation of multi-resistant cause (including MRSA, and the prevention of diseases in hospitals to one of its priorities.

Bulgaria, the property-paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian Immobilienmarktes is so pleasant - the whole of Europe is looking carefully at the rarely mentioned earlier the Balkan nations.
What, where, and who still buy the cheapest market in the EU, but rapidly more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian re-Max division.
There is no doubt that Bulgaria is currently the most sought-plaster for Immobilienkäufe in Eastern European area, with favourable Skiappartements and homes at sea.
Between the mountain regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on sea Albena, the 'Goldküste ", the" Sonnenküste', and the historic Städtchen Sozopol and Nessebar the stars, however, property and around Kavarna Balcik are also more and more.
According to estimates by re-Max analysts in Bulgaria the interior wid sooner or later also attract investors, for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very favourable region of Russian recorded more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers offer attractive services, trade and space for offices and meeting rooms high returns.
Bulgaria is well on the way to be one of the most attractive European Golferparadiese, and therefore attract alongside the summer and winter tourist season is also in the other two seasons tourists.
Buy a forward-looking investors, therefore, already large-scale, for example around Bansko.
Analysts, people who want to buy property in Bulgaria, a change of their Lebenswandels.
Most of the buyer are British, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are in the Black Sea and the ski resorts mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers Georgi Jankov, Regionaldirektor of re-Max Bulgaria says.
Those who want to buy property revitalisierte either 50-EUR 100 000, or an houses 5-EUR 15 000, which they then renovate itself.
Good links and access and communications are important, but also the proximity to a city, shops and doctors are crucial for the consumer.
The second category of those who are seeking a Feriendomizil belong (Bulgaria was listed in December among the top Ten destinations of Germans).
The third group from businessmen who invest with the aim of a mid- to long-term added value.
However, property in the capital, will be more expensive to date, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, the property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, over the last five years there has been an increase in prices but 21% per year.
The rise in the real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Hungarian Fodor and the six percentage points
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor presentation, the meeting of experts on Tuesday at the end, and the debate on the international climate regime post-2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians discuss from 192 countries on the road map of Bali, in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures are laid down for the period after 2012, after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
At the moment, a heated debate between industrialised countries and developing countries is in progress.
The United States have already announced that they want to have concrete figures not negotiate, but it would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels by 25-40%.
The other major question the Conference is whether the industrialised countries are ready, apart from the reduction of emissions in the developing countries, both financially and to support technologically.
It has also been reached an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol has insinuated adjustment fund should be managed by a 16-köpfigen Council, probably in the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) of the UN, as in the 'Piac is recorded és profit'.
Six per cent of Hungary
The Environment Gábor Fodor supported on behalf of Hungary, the commitment of the EU to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister has stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (20% compared to 1990), irrespective of whether the 'agreement after 2012 will' made successful or not, and even the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction soferne other large industrialized countries of the world, or developing countries are also prepared to comply with their obligations and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor emphasised that the objective of the Member States that have joined in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had with their then 15 Member States already to a minus by 8%.
The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gases by 6% compared to the years of 1985-87 - a figure that will meet the country, as is widely reported in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - which, after all, is the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only after 2012 would enter into force, and in this case the Kyoto Protocol Reduktionsvorhaben not renewed, international Emissionsreduktionssystem, also stressed the importance of the IPCC, the international climate change by the Nobel Peace Prize excellent scientific Committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay the emission levels, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which according to the Wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
The British army on YouTube advertising
The British army units have published photographs on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to Popularitätssteigerung on the Videoportal.
First of all, the British air force (fact) YouTube for discovered: take special forces deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 video on against the Taliban operations led to the network, the BBC reported.

The UK Ministry was recorded under 'defenceheadquarters' in the spring 2007 to publish a video on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Aussenministerium (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace-keeping troops stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube-channels.
In Afghanistan,
Initially, the air force has published the videos, with the aim of recruit soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says that the contributions serve the purpose to inform the population on the real objectives of Auslandseinsätze.
This kind of publizierte propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional Fernsehwerbungen, Verteidigungsexperte Gordon Mackenzie on the BBC, however, these videos still be a certain amount of political message, since they confirm the raison d'être of the government ’ s military measures decided on its own way.
Americans with game advertise
The army must, however, also fight against Amateuraufnahmen it carefully, alongside the processed, photographs also zensurierten network - such as the show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, 'official' Propagandafilmen the loss of more than about the bloody sides of the war will not be shown, however.
The Kriegsschauplätzen in Iraq and Afghanistan has already in use in many gedrehte videos which have been brought to the fore, these 'race' have discovered the British but only recently for themselves.
However, the Americans to advertise the slightly different kind, namely with the free of charge herunterladbaren Schießspiel 'America's Army', in which the players in the context of a more or less live spread simulation in the skin of soldiers can slip.

Political plans: Hungarian guard Staatsrisiko increased
In the view of the department for risk analysis Analysing) (Risk-division of political action plans in this August, with the support of the 'movement for a better Hungary' formed Hungarian guard have increased the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects.
In the 'Risikowarnungs report' of the Institute it means, among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk is the 'tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of a dispute of this kind, the one.
As has already been mentioned, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "persons of public life have left to the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups who have built their political strategy on the Roma Hungary-contrast '.
It is believed that this aggravate the problem, make the sensible dialogue impossible, would benefit foot injuries, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes that the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, 'damaging the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity'.
Let us remind ourselves that, since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is constantly on the rise, so that 2007 several since summer, founded 'national Selbstverteidigungsverein' ablaze organisations.
'these groups have in common is that they be defined in each case as a civil organisation, while about them openly to prepare their members to - sometimes armed - civil defence tasks, defence, Ordnungshütung), by invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the army, or to the state itself (', '.
And further: all of this is in accordance with the method which tried to disguise different, to the political and Parteiverdrossenheit the population-based, political aspirations as civil initiative.
The emphasis on the civilian nature and the Vereinsform serve not just the circumvention of legal obstacles, which could in the wake of the registration appear in court - it is also a political strategy.
As suggested in the analysis of the activities of the Hungarian guard constitute a risikoerhöhenden factor for the relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian guard was quoted in several of its neighbours as a potential source, some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain countries of the creation of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian-policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region '-'.
From the point of view of the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian guard not into East in central Europe, so the political risk has grown for the region as a whole.
As has already been mentioned, the activities of the Hungarian guard are Bulgarischen comparable with those of the National Guard, whose establishment in August 2007 has announced by the extreme right-wing Bulgarischen National Union (BNU).
In the light of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard the Roma Massenausschreitungen that have taken place in a regeneration of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has noted the incidents in the same way as the basis for establishing the Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation is the 'national protection'.
In their view, was in the last 17 years a genuine 'Zigeunerterror' in Bulgaria, the government has, however, remained indifferent and - as political plans.
And further: the initiative of contract had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I have said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is shown by the fact that some of the Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to Widerstandszwecken to set up their own guards.
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far shows many similarities with which the Bulgarischen Guard it is not to exclude that the Hungarian Roma react with the Organisieren their own protection to the threats, it says in the case of political Risikowarnungsbericht plans.
Attila Juhász, Forschungsdirektor in political plans said on the question of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes.
Every year, would be published Risikoanalyseberichte and risk-changing tendencies should be clear, public opinion will be kept informed, as in the case of the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes.
Holiday season are not
In Hungary so that the practice of Umdisponierens of working days has become established around the Christmas holidays are regulated by law in the meantime, however, the coming year shows us less these days.
Also in the EU and in America something else we understand by 'holiday'.
The Hungarian legal system to distinguish between Staatsfeiertagen and labour-free days.
Arbeitsfreie days are mostly church holidays or are with major historic events in context.
For example, we are celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old, as well as from the first day of the new year are labour-free days - the latter alone, so that the New Year's Eve-Feiernden sit.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The Staatsfeiertage are the 15 March, which is reminiscent of the 1848 revolution, and of 23 October, the day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August is the formation of a state, on 1 May, the work celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we remember our deaths.
In addition, there are two holidays to Easter, Pfingsten and Christmas.
Since our Heads of State, national or religious holidays are rarely on a weekend, the practice of 'working day-postponement' has proved its worth in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday just one day.
The price of extended weekends is, however, that we have to work against the Samstagen very well, or go to school.
When this day, before or after the holiday, should be dealt with at the end of the day, will be set by the ministers for many years in a regulation of our own.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, for public equally employees and officials of the public service.
With the exception of companies and institutions, in which the operation without interruption, will continue in the holidays, are only.
This is the only by working order at the end of the year the holidays rather confused, from 24 December, life will formally here at home, because most of the days Zeitausgleich between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or has been abolished for holidays.
In the next year, more holidays in the Wochenmitte, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less Umdisponierungen during the days when this year.
The calendar will first of all around the day of work 'to', so that people can remain the same four days in a row at home.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day, so that the Friday, 2 May will be a day of rest.
The second re-planning is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, 18 October, we will have to the Friday 24 October through beforehand.
The end of the year, however, will be completely in the sign of holidays, are all from 24 December, and are even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent, in order to get colleagues
E-mails which we abzuschicken forget Sprachnachrichten which we never get - harmless lies that no longer find us: they express' colour 'in the day-to-day lives in the workplace.
The question is simply to vermweiden, whether we used to these small inconvenience, or it is better to the challenge and this is false, for other dangerous situations.
Tips..
'Sorry, I have to tell you forget that someone has called by the marketing department' - says a colleague.
That we missed a meeting?
At best we regretted it and perhaps by invoking the marketing department in trying to make it again, and we should forget reumütig), the news (this is the less normal method has admitted.
In most cases, the matter is end with an excuse.
Before we got tangled up in embarrassing excuses, we should consider aware, where we can bring his colleagues certainly awkward moments and try to prevent these situations.
Something lending facilities, which are not a itself?
There is little Nervigeres than if we according to a document Bürozubehör, or the telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the Heftgerät was still on the table - this morning, it is away?
Or the lost tight meeting will be discovered at the hands of a gentlemen?
We should not ask nothing borrowing by colleagues, because they will be if it is right to say that had little frustrated.
In other words, no Kuverts or post-its from the office in the bag, because it could be a itself: no more because, if one 's needs but as a matter of urgency.
Getratsche on the private lives of the?
There is no effective means to stop a Tratsch, which was already included in the world.
Anyone who with whom, what?
Where and why?
We should not make the information (or suspicions) on the private lives of colleagues for every possibility to the nose.
And if anyone but to open up and gives us be innerstes secret, and we should not use this confidence.
It is the best as a grave instead of the is not here, even if other on the problems of colleagues also know.
Without reason ill reported?
If you are in office, telephones, under the name of nagging headaches ill to notify precisely because we feel uneasy, or merely to rest, we should be clear about one thing: the own work, unextendable settlement, projects with fixed deadlines must now rather than a colleagues do for themselves.
The Members not blame game!
The previous day, if we know that we will not create the next day it into office, or that something could be somewhere in the middle, which is why we must remain at home, we should make it on time, so that neither the gentlemen, yet the head will be faced with unexpected absence.
Gesumme, Gekicher, telephones
It is engaged in his work, but is disrupted by the are suddenly Gekicher the ladies?
Unwanted mitgehört a telephone call, that we should not listen better?
We should not berate colleagues with sums Singen, talks (we) is through their heads, Getrampel, constant Schimpfen or Nörgeln.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not in writing (a task, plan to organise) deepened.
Are the other is to blame?
A project is not ready on time, forget abzuschicken an important letter or important Nachrichte, it is not the fault of the own forgetfulness in other!
As far as possible, we should not finish your speech to the chaos in office or the gentlemen.
The best means of recognises its mistake and apologized, if others were also affected!
The question of how the mistake of lost ground again, or it can do so, is entirely appropriate.
In the office - a feeling at home?
Trainingshose and Schlapfen: convenient for at home, has lost but in office nothing!
Not even then we should wear so too lightly, if it would allow the workplace actually!
Bloß not to be slipshod manner - we should both his colleagues, and also respect for themselves, so that in the office in accordance with you, if appropriate, also beautiful and elegantly!
We all want to make quite rightly - or, as it is for other interesting
STOP and go-transport, the car in the middle of the allmorgendlichen congestion.
A strange refrain from the radio erklingt: the tone of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
Mr President I higher the noise.
The speed of change to the existing strains of the Bass, and as a genuine Klangjuwel a female chorus.
It is the song 'Wings of Love' 'Zagar that erklingt on mr2.
The domestic Musikszene has not just with us for a long time luxury qualitative Electropop.
But now we see even the congestion differently, when we hear the new Album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new and exciting production from the domestic digital Underground-scene contribute to a modification of the overall picture, and the Garagenrock with his Gitarrengequitsche in itself is if ', the domestic Electropop shows that there are new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer has started in Pécs, even in the bond Yonderboi musizierte before it, perhaps, because a pub with no two incompatible Pfeifer - to go its own way began.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and its music, the (elements from Jazz, electronic and pop verschmilzt, he has used but only when there has been approached with a request for the komponieren Soundtrack to a film in it, for example,
'Szezon' Mr Ferenc Török).
The formation, which was initially appeared in smaller clubs, only to the wider public, as the magazine 'wan2 reihte' their first Album from the year 2002 among the top 50 domestic Alben and Zagar, together with Yonderboi kürte, for almost one, also in the West marketable trend setter.
There is no doubt that were Zagar and his band "trendy ', but not interested, whether they bear the mark.
The band has responded, as it should, with a new, better Album.
The new Album now come under the title 'Cannot Walk fly Instead' could open up new paths, but the title expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression stems from the time when Balázs Zságer was still with another ribbon.
The luftige, flying allusion would indeed be in order, however, the - and the spirit of the trends appropriate - fair Gitarre, n the influence of the coat 'roll on not only the ätherischen nature of music.
With these Liedern of living in England, and with the bond 'The puzzle' working singer György Ligeti has presented at the first in the Millenáris.
A lot of Album has managed even the Radioschlager - since Neuestem from early morning until late Popmusik mr2 Petőfi Hörern carries out the number 'Wings of Love' ', with the participation of six domestic Sängerinnen (' Underground Divas was'), the Ohrwurm gradually.
Everything is in order (?).
The hvg.hu has Balázs Zságer in demand.
Hvg.hu: this new Hit raises the question: what is your music reserved for a certain section?
Balázs Zságer: the term 'Schichtmusik' means not just me a great deal.
In my opinion, there are two main castes in the Popmusik, and not mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but Kommerziell and honest.
Even the so-called 'alternative' or 'Underground music seicht and can be meaningless, just as they can be but only for the sale of produced, which makes them to commercial music.
It is also a good pop-number from an honest motive.
The receptiveness of Hörers also works in accordance with this principle, regardless of the languages and borders.
Hvg.hu: you You a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience your music to?
Example Zs.: abroad, in particular to the west of the Popmusik has a greater tradition.
Since not only go to Twens teenagers or concerts, but also the elderly audience.
They are the trends in the Popmusik that around them, much more because they believe it for a part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what role is to the public in your work?
It is important that those who, where many hear your music?
Example Zs.: of course it is good to see a good feeling, that more and more to our concerts.
We have never komponiert but for the market.
The music is not, in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the public is generally in the concerts felt and where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I have noticed one: you make it all very disturbing, you are not more interesting.
Hvg.hu: how far you follow the example of möchtest Yonderboi?
He is on his way and has built up Solist rather his career in the West.
Example Zs.: we are not really its way, in that we always tried to read any this in our music.
We are rather than Teamplayer, trust in the musical presence of the other and they should develop.
Initially, was, of course, comparisons of our work with the inevitable Yonderboi, several of us have come from his band and taken a different path.
Hvg.hu: in the Charts of mr2 Petőfi Wings of Love 'is' in the first place.
Many have heard only in connection with the name of this number Zagar.
The opening up of was carried out with a somewhat populäreren style in the direction of a wider audience?
Example Zs.: we had no plans to write a Low Countries that goes something like the should then be used as a motor for the Album.
In this song there is more.
It was intended as a final of the Albums with which we wanted to resolve the Klangorgie and the difficult issues.
Hvg.hu: as you have the six Sängerinnen selected?
Why is it, what was the guiding principle?
Example Zs.: the basic idea was to make a Gospel-artigen chorus.
The idea was to put together the voices of talented Solisten the domestic Musikszene.
So the sechsköpfige chorus has arisen - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [neo] Juci Németh - we then apäter 'Underground Divas' then.
Hvg.hu: you have just wolltest song, or it will have to shape the girls?
Example Zs.: no longer existed in the Instrumentalversion, but as the material for the Album was complete, we thought that this number is still needs ".
The Akkordenabfolge formally requested after a Gesangsstimme.
I have the tune eingesungen still in the same night, later they have learned the girl child.
There was practically everything at first sight and shocking spontaneously.
I can remember, I was quite elektrisiert, but it has already taken the 'Divas'.
With my vote the song alone would never become so sharply.
Hvg.hu: both on the record, and also to the concert we had the impression, though, the girls in the background.
There is no Solo-part (apart from short by Solo Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, and are not sing louder than the music, their singing is accompanied by the music not only.
They were also on the scene.
Is it the intention?
B.Zs.: that they have stood behind, was a purely technical problems.
However, we wanted to make them deliberately not Solo-roles.
In the number of it is also important that we should be a little egos forget, forget who is how and where, we leave that these particular us wing, emporheben the wings of love.
I would like others too have felt this euphoric state that we have felt, as the story is created.
Hvg.hu: what was the most expensive song?
Example Zs.: the musical Schaffensarbeit actually none, there has been more in the Mixen difficult tasks.
For example, 'Dorian Gray's dilemma', in which I was on a Konzertklavier, or 'coat' n '-roll Goes To The Girls', where the Groove did not want to work longer, but in the end everything has brought together, as with a jigsaw puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your Lieblingsnummer the new Album?
Example Zs.: the changed with the concerts continuously, and even now, where I have the Album 'losgelasssen'.
At the moment we are 'prophet Is A Fool', 'Escape From the Earth and the number of' Never The Same '.
Betrügerischer broker riskierte Minderwertigkeitsgefühlen billion for
Bodenloser fraudsters
Its former employees Jerome Kerviel described the French Bankenriese Société Générale, owners of the domestic Komerční banka.
It is meeting to almost EUR 5 billion.
But it seems, rather than only Kerviel was a major players who wanted to do it to his colleagues in the same way, moreover, was certainly not incapable of.
In contrast to all the major Bankhäusern he is in good time the crisis on amerikanischenn mortgage market.
"He is rather psychologically weak 'has been heard from the mouth of his superiors, indicate when the police.
As is evident from the statements Kerviels which the French media, for example, the newspaper Le Monde, published, he was a man, at the end of last year was made with his business profits in the sum of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis, not only in America
'Everything, is what I wanted to do was to earn money for my bank,' he said in his statement.
In the summer, it was able to earn on the American crisis half a billion euro.
He had the opportunity already erspäht at the start of the year.
In February, there were already first news that so-called sub-prime-mortgages, as they residential customers or those who had previously Abzahlungsprobleme would be given to run into difficulties.
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis.
Kerviel did not believe and reserved the right.
At the end of the year, he had been spiralling its profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
'Very than I had deserves the first half a billion I did not know how I should explain that,' Kerviel continue to exist and says that he had keep definitely nothing for itself.
During the whole interrogations, is it that he has falsified documents, so that we would not on the trail of these nefarious dealings.
It even managed to hold its head up the garden path, even if the gradually Eurex-stock market for interested its business.
Risikoprofit
He Befürchtete aufzufliegen?
I hardly.
'I thought that it satisfies the simple fact that I voted for the Bank deserves 1.6 billion,'.
Where he had the courage to be so much?
He had to define its position gradually.
In the Société Générale it entered into force in the year 2000, immediately after study at the end of the University of Lyon, had a.
Be compensate was around USD 51000.
After two years he was already an assistant a broker and in the year 2005, it was with a self-employed broker compensate by 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never deserve as much as others.
'Very during my first discussion in the year 2005, I knew that we witnessed me.
For my training and also because of my professional and personal development, 'Kerviel declared the investigators.
But soon after its entry of the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance he deserved much by the London bombings when he half a billion euro to Kursverluste this title.
And that was the cause - now he wanted more.
Until you gain method, we leave you
This is like a snowball, 'he said the police officers.
But the bosses supposedly knew of all, or jeopardising it.
'so long as I earned money, I closed my eyes'.
But then the great blow came at the beginning of this year.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
A weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for this.
On Monday, when he came to work, he was not an employee of the Bank.
And a few days later, the Bank announced that they have lost meeting five billion euros.
And how they came to him on the trail of these nefarious dealings?
He made Verdächtig by a holiday.
'I have noted just four days from the previous year.
A broker, which does not go on holiday, is one which does not want that we look to him in the maps' Kerviel finally said.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to 365 billion to come
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday, a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic in the next few years to EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion kronor).
We are talking about approximately half of the sum that the Czech Republic can in the years 2007 to 2013 at all received from Brussels.
Approximately 125 billion kronor come from seven Regionalentwicklungsprogrammen.
Czech firms can be allocated approximately 100 billion kronor from the programme 'companies and innovation.
The most money, approximately 150 billion, will go to the Verkehrsausbau.
This is the biggest Verkehrsprogramm development programme and covers up to 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can from the fund.
This money is increased in accordance with the budget of the State Verkehrsinfrastrukturfonds, will have on 90.8 billion next year.
The programme 'companies and innovation to be used for entrepreneurs and businesses to gain funds to innovative enterprises.
Firms to gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for Unternehmensforschung, but also for the introduction of more effective organisation.
In the existing money-Aquisition from EU funds under the new applicant countries, the Czech Republic is one of the most successful to date.
For twenty years of imprisonment Nicaraguanisches Court confirms Expräsidenten
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty years of imprisonment of the former President Arnold Alemán, to which he 2003 because of financial fraud to the tune of USD 100 million (almost 1.8 billion kronor) had been sentenced.
Later, but he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in its Hazienda in nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former Head of State (1997-2002) this Central American country again behind bars, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
The chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, that it is now of the Haftbeamten depend on whether we can serve his sentence Alemán at home, or whether it is in prison.
After a court was four years ago, that the government had regularly Alemán money until accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These firms were fictitious and the accounts were in fact his relatives and closest supporters.
Finally, landed some of this money in a fund Alemán had set up for the financing of his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yes, it is achieved.
The state budget is adopted.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget of the government has drafted, and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit.
The for the current year, has been with the support of the Social Democrats ČSSD (approved), because it had submitted Minister Sobotka (by this party) and the ČSSD it could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government nothing drastic happened this time.
The Congress approved this traditionally little known, however, highly significant law calmly.
To a certain extent, this is a paradox.
Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters of the budget and, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is for the media a dankbareres issue, and that is why they devote more attention.
A dispute among politicians for the public is much more interesting than sobering figures.
The Member States have suffered in the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses, which cannot eliminate the budget for the year 2008 at once:
The first is the high percentage of expenditure, which is due by law, but it is not just about pensions, but also about spending, which adopted the 'tacit' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the budgetary deficit as a result of the first Schwachpunkts.
The third restriction in the deficits of public finances, in other words the public deficits of local communities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermaßen under control.
It is a veritable time bomb the budget deficit of local communities.
Many mayors gave to open up out of revenue from tax, levies and bank lending further sources for investment, often bond thoughtlessly by their halls in excess indebted.
In recent years, it was to pay this debt by massive selling shares of the energy and other networks which they had received in train the privatisation of state.
Now this source is already dried up.
As far as we keep to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy for a number of years, as the rest of the world, is going through a period of growth, which prides itself on the ČSSD without constantly.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state-induced these governments, but more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our Republic.
That is a great shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, threatened least of poverty.
This is why no nassiven social programmes are needed, which have been blown up in recent years, unfortunately, quite unnecessarily in record time scale.
Even if it is a part of the absurd populist expenditure, which were adopted this year, before the elections, to remove, it is clear that if it is not in the near future, to an increase in the retirement age and to a reform of pensions, then ends practically any policy in this country, and, regardless of who is in power, he will remain nothing more than a mere government.
It is only a slight exaggeration if we say that from the politicians, officials, which divide the bulk of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget is not a revolution, but it can only put an end to the displacement of normal expenditure by Pflichtausgaben.
The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would be superfluous if previous governments would not have been spent in the last ten years, which was only.
If we do not want it really comes to mere administrators from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is to take on taxes and charges in the situation, calm in the preparation for further reform laws.
This will enable a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.

Banks crisis want to overcome
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
So more than USD 100 billion will come through auctions on the Währungsmärkte.
In these auctions banks interest rates to which they are prepared to lend money auction each other.
For example, the US Fed sends USD 40 billion at auction, further 24 they blithely makes for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is 11.September after the attacks of the first time that the central banks in the individual Member States agree on such a coordinated approach or to alleviate the effects of a crisis.
This step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, in other words, the increasing lack of free verfügbarem capital which give the banks' for its customers Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report by the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group.
'The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to around 50%,' Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have not already bedienter loans for 60 billion dollars lost, especially in the United States.
Further deplored analysts expect.
'The central banks must have had really afraid of what more can do everything, as decided on this approach, "said the head economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
'It is that the situation is really bad,' he said.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, for their customers loans more expensive.
This would reduce the consumption and plunge the American economy in recession, possibly with the impact on the economic growth of the entire world.
The central banks have decided, after it has not succeeded in reducing them, the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbankzinssatz, which is used in the Geldverleih between banks.
This means that the banks have constantly fear, to lend money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks in the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom have reduced its interest rates on several occasions during the autumn.
'The will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates,' Greg Salvaggio said of the Tempus programme the Reuters Consulting.
A few analysts are of the opinion that this step of the central banks Aufheizung contributes to the crisis, because it does not solve the basic problem, and it is the case of Immobilienmarktes in the United States.
Klaus: debates, the ecologists is quite incredible
Global climate change supposedly harm most developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus once again to the problem of global warming.
The criticism referred to the coming to an end the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book 'A blue, green planet,' he said that the debates of the ecologists are quite incredible.
Klaus, not only the structure of the Conference is unacceptable, a strange mixture of government representatives of non-governmental organisations and such forms, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which it has, and the reality of the situation.
'The debate is unstrukturiert, it is a Wortfeuerwerk, this is only a substitute for a real solution to the current problems, "said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasised in the presentation of his book that this issue is very important to him and that he is committed to this.
It is also expressed its satisfaction that his book appear in the German translation, because I am often 'cartoons of my views'.
Now unverzerrt interested parties could read its attitude.
Klaus reminded us that he is not a Klimatologe, but he was, in his opinion, adequate conditions, to write a book about this.
He was ultimately academics, able to understand and to assess the technical pamphlets, have experience of statistics and was also economist.
The main thrust of the book he described the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that it is therefore quite natural that it to global warming, no consensus view among researchers that the consequences of the current changes are not to be too large and seriously and therefore no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable expensive.
In addition, he think it as someone who experience with totalitarian Sytemen have to impose unacceptable for other unproven views, to see this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On issues of repeated here, he said that he was not against 'a reasonable protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between costs and yield.'
On the same issue had spoken Klaus two months ago in Vienna in Hayek Institute.
600000 people have not managed to exchange their driving licences
600000 drivers missed the deadline, to exchange their old driving licences, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day, where we can apply the conversion, so as to ensure that the authorities manage to sign up to the end of this year a new driving licence.
The ministry but not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid Fahrberechtigung go to New Year on the roads.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not have exchanged their driving licences, which no longer want to go.
While small localities notify the lowering of interest in a strong Füherscheinumtausch, the offices of the capital to be inundated with requests and the interest in the changeover grew this week.
On a daily basis from the City Council fertigt some 2000 customers.
We must be approximately half an hour.
In Prague around 140000 drivers do not have exchanged their driving licence.
The issuing of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay SEK but to 500.
Drivers who do not create the changeover until the end of the year and without valid licence leave home tomorrow, is threatened from January a fine.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 kronor.
The police but it can be reflected in the infringement, with a warning.

Children - were reversed: 12 million
As far as the Vertauschung of children in a as the advocate of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba wants, ask the hospital in Třebíč SEK 12 million plus cost compensation.
For each of the mothers of three million, the founding fathers of the two million and for the children per million.
The hospital 200000 offers a maximum for each set of parents.
The representatives of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore not with the proposal Velebas totally opposed.
'we reject this proposal, it is many times too high,' Dostál said after the current negotiations.
"in order to be able to define our views on this but a counter-proposal, we need the opinion which drew up the opposing side.
We will see whether it has any longer.
But we insist on the view that this should be for all together in Hunderttausenderbereich 'Dostál stressed.
The amount should move according to him, between 100000 200000 kroner and for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the family Jabloňov for wanted to every month, it did not have raised their biological daughter, a million kroner.
For Veleba Entschädigungsverhandlungen served as the basis for a report that has been drawn up for him the Academic Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of children suffered according to experts in the field of psychiatry mental and psychological damage and Stresssymptome in varying degrees and depth.
The men vertrugen the stress situation better, even if they have been accusations that they would be able to prevent the confusion between the babies.

The Bezirkshauptmann the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische level) presented at the end of October SEK 100000 any family as a substitute for expenditure, which were created by the errors of the hospital in Třebíč, subjected to the area.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are assured of law, owing to a failure.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, just for once, you can ask the bearers of aid.
So far, the courts have awarded to stakeholders comparatively low compensation, the amounts determined by tables and moved in the field of hundreds of millions in exceptional cases.
Came to be UK Walachei Polívka
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the brand 'UK Walachei'.
The judge in Bezirksgericht Ostrava, although he has used the term 'Walachischer King', but the project had built many years of work in a team to Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actors.
Polívka adopted today do not participate in the negotiations.
His lawyer, the matter is closed but probably not and his client will probably be appeal.
'The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team at the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär wish to participate,' Polívkas lawyer said after the negotiations.
Put all the words "Walachisches UK 'precisely these actors and entertainer.
Is of the same opinion Harabiš.
'We have an almost ten years of work behind us.
Fund-raising and concepts of activities, 'he said.
According to him, the dispute over money.
'The years that the project is successful and that they could have something that will have noticed them.
They want to parasitär gain in our work, 'he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the term 'Walachischer King' for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actors Radoslav Brzobohatý krönte him.
It was at that time, but not with the intention to justify a fiktives UK.
A few years later Harabiš came to the idea to spend walachische passports.
From an original facetious action a business and entrepreneurial activity clearly emerged is that the creation of the company Harabiš 'Walachisches UK' followed.
1997 Polívka agreed to the use of its name and his signature in the passports and offered their owners reductions even during a visit to its Farm and its Theatervorstellungen.
Anyone who will sit on the throne?
The judge argued today that Harabiš used only the mere idea which Polívka made in the programme 'Manege' for his business intentions known.
'The popularity Polívkas has helped the project of the walachischen UK sure,' the judge has said.
They also said, however, that the soul of the project are Harabiš and his team, who would have given him.
The cooperation of the today disharmony parties took until the year 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka Vsetín organised in the official crowning glory.
Since then, but between Polívka Harabiš and began to combine the disputes in the removal of 'king Boleslavs I. elected by the Greek Calends' culminated.
Then, at the behest of the leading Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
2002 was then and his company Harabiš Polívka against the complaint that the disqualifying the court today.
Clarity in the dispute could Harabiš prepared by the fight to the throne and a half Princess.
This is a new King should emerge.
A date details and he has not yet wanted.
'We want to come to nothing.
It should be a kind of Königsumzug in the Walachei.
The King should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can quietly express, 'Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1 (6) VTi: Voruteile dwindling
To tell the truth, I have never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
His Fahreigenschaften were not worth very much, the quality of Gangschaltung, the control and processing could be termed rather below average.
Now, however, his successor, is the Peugeot 207, on the market, and which is much better.
With the name of the Kombi SW is still a bit, and it only remains for me to change my mind.
When I had the classic Hatchback tested the 207, I had to complain about me, for example, about the low Kopffreiheit on the Hintersitzen.
These complaints, there is now no longer, because if the Kombi is designed in such a way that not even Zweimetermänner.
Further to quickly
I shall go through the interior decorating only briefly in order not to repeat myself.
It is a rather successful design, where I have only because of the meagre Mitteltunnels objections.
I would welcome a little more designerische design, where the car is otherwise such an elegant impression.
The seats are convenient, and over the times are, where we may be a line no longer exists, or to brief seats.
Also the Seitenhalt has been substantially improved 206.
With regard to the space, we can also feel the compounded here the dimensions.
The Kombi, which I mentioned earlier, the lack of Kopffreiheit is also removed.
In the boot suitcase
The most important thing in this car is but the Laderaum.
(I must also because of the aufklappbaren Rückfensters) as a very good and describe beladbar platzsparend.
The Hohlräume are equipped with Haltegurten, which constitute a perfect compromise.
They do not disrupt, I consider it apart and also more severe objects.
But we have been talking about the Ladevolumen.
It is according to the table in the basic 428 litre, which is a more competition in relation to the average value.
We do not, however, in comparison with the best selling car in the Czech Republic, this category, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we see that Peugeot falls to show signs of 52 litre.
For a Auslandsurlaub or the Einladen Kinderwagens of this value is already critical.
But I would like to emphasise the Positiva, I must mention the following the belt Umklappen the very shallow Laderaum or even the very low Ladekante.
120 PS in four ranks
Our Testwagen was equipped with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor included 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 KW.
And, quite frankly, a 1 600-Kubik-engine should take the drives a families-Hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and is well away.
If I compare this with his counterpart in Skoda that works sometimes as would be a vehicle exhaust pipe Lappen, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
The price speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-funded car with a geräumigen Innneren and a very good driving force.
The basic price of cars with the 1400er Benzinmotor of SEK 329900 is.
With our driving force it costs SEK from 410900, which is already quite a lot.
The funding of the premium Testwagens proposes once again with an extra SEK 80000 annually.
We had however Kopfairbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung, electrical Fensterheber and and...
So the car is costing a total of SEK 531900 simple.
That is a lot, but you calculate the increase of a Fabia and you will arrive in a very similar amount.
Therefore, all that remains is the decision as to which we want to choose brand.
Integration Slovak pupils do not succeed in britschen schools
British schools to the number of children is increasing from Eastern European countries, which gives rise to fears in local people the further development of the local education system.
The integration of the people of Eastern Europe is now on a number of obstacles.
British schools even note of cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe aptly illustrates britschen schools in the case of North Kent, where the confrontations between the Greeks and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Quarrels, harassment and Raufereien of pupils have given to the relations between the parents.
The situation has now so far that the police in Chatham firmly adopted a Slovak woman who had a ten-year with a Eisenstange boys.
The defence of the accused is that the boy offended them with racist abuse.
The police had to intervene after an attack of two under-age girls on a Slovak immigrants.
The girls were made to the man supposedly racist comments and hit him with stones.
'When we went home, a boy kletterte on a Bushäuschen and spuckte on us.
As I said to him that he should stop it bewarf us with apples and pears and then entblößte Gesäß, 'a mother Slovak pupils of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe, even as a fight for survival.
The specific cases show that the atmosphere between the local people and immigrants in British schools will always tense.
In the United Kingdom are 70000 Slovaks reported, came here to work.
Some 30000 Slovak pupils visit therefore British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean.
For visitors it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect your holidays, that will meet, if you select only the right thing to do.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm as a Teich.
All palm trees and inclusive with Kellnern which offer on the beach pizza, ice and betörende cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Gulf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you will find that in überreichlichem standards.
Only on an island, you will find but much more, and these island is Cuba, the biggest and best the Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish Cuba was the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus put it the most beautiful place, the ever has seen a human face.
Havana was once a camp or Durchgangslager of treasures, who had stolen from the Spanish in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era.
The hotel Nacional was right at the end of the 20th century.
Build it was one of the leaders of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was regarded as a crime (in the United States, particularly during the prohibition), was seen in Cuba and support, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Under its guests, among other things, were
Was Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise blocks in Havana, on the broad avenues went grew cars which were the Kultsymbolen the Fünfziger years of the last Jahrhundets.
Ernest Hemingway bought a plots in San Francisco de Paula, who in the vicinity, and he had his Cojímar Jacht lie.
To the walls of Bodeguita del Medio stars of the personalities and politicians from the whole of America windstorms their signatures.
And today?
To the walls of the Havana Bodeguita you too will be able to leave your Autogramm.
In the bar in the hotel Nacional mixt cocktails it for you to request.
And the Kultautos the Fünfziger drive around in Havana until today, because the once imported Schigulis Fiats have fallen apart and in the air-ecologically vulnerable and actually long ago.
Havana, in particular his eldest part may be come down, nowhere, it will take place within a radius of colonial Sehenswürdigkeiten as many wonderful as it is here.
Precisely herausgeputzt other places, for example, Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism is essential means of money, it was the green light to this development.
Over the last 15 years, new hotels are not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is still a fad, which is unique in the world and, above all, Eisenbahnliebhaber attracts them.
The sugar cane plantations of isolated dampf- and diesel Schmalspurbahnen have undertaken to the sugar factories.
It has not been renewed Fuhrpark over decades, and so they putzige and fully functioning locomotives, their counterparts elsewhere have long been museum.
Ausflugsziele
The bedeutendendsten places is not the majority of the people of Cuba.
We on Varadero or Havana must no longer write in detail.
Is only mention the fact that in a museum is already mentioned Hemingways plots, whose visit the person who may these writer, should not escape.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the malerischsten corner of Cuba.
On the extensive Kalkboden vegetation is growing.
The Mogotas, -felsen Kalkhügel and on the steep ragen Talboden, in their Hohlräumen fertile soil collected through the verwitterte Felsbereiche are also covered by thick Bewuchs.
It is this valley, where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its Endform you can decide on it, if you visit a Zigarrenfabriken of Havana.
It may be that some interesting, it seems that the Chilean consequence of the kid 'Major Zeman was made.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was very briefly, since the Spaniards were invaded the island.
Glory and wealth expressed their the trafficking of slaves and sugar.
The wealth schmucken embodied in the beauty of the small town.
The Spanish Kolonialarchitektur, strongly influenced by the subsequent French settlers, has changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, which is situated between the sea and the Escambray-mountains, is such a remote place that there were still there in the Fünfziger years of the last century not road, which would have the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped that it overlooked.
Nothing has been built there, but we must therefore nothing, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If we consider Trinidad has more than one afternoon time, then it is worth considering interesting places in the environment, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of sugar factories'.
Tonight we should go in the Casa de la Música, the relaunching of the darkness, and where the music until this morning is not silent.
Baracoa
This Städtchen described in the East of Cuba, as some of the best of the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that Guantánamo lead to high and must overcome zerküftete mountains and by a landscape which is affected by human intervention.
These eastern outposts of Cuba on the UNESCO, thanks to the local untouched nature in their heritage-list.
The best is produced chocolate, in the Church is) the Cross of Columbus (in reality it is approximately one hundred years after the journeys of Columbus, and the hills, where the former Burg, the current hotel El Castillo, are to see several Tafelberge which El Yunque is the best known.
The coffee, rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra-mountains, the Schweinebucht and the island Isla de Pinos that Tropicana-Kabarett, the sanctity of Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, on the Santeria, an African religion, commit themselves to the descendants of slaves, all of which one could write many sides.
But, as we so says: better with my own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say.
Too little soldiers and the lack of equipment needed influence on the United States, the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates draw up a specific plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries were in Edinburgh in Scotland, the units stationed in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans under the allies.
While the United States introduced through its Verteigungsminister Robert Gates activity to the NATO units, the United Kingdom, the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan Government and in the intensification of development aid.
'In Afghanistan is a Vorwärtsentwicklung but military power can only be a part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants, even a further development of the economy and to start security, 'the British Verteigungsminister The Browne the BBC says.
90 per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has achieved according to the American army the highest level for five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased in comparison with the previous year by 27%, in the southern province Helmand even to 60%.
The NATO countries have deployed around 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, approximately a quarter of the southern territory.
The United States, the allies have to an absolute limit but what organisation and equipment for units.
In practical terms, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts on the training of the Afghan units.
"We must be seriously on the concrete objectives for the next time and think about the way in which we can achieve it, 'Gates said.
Similarly, today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop expressed.
'I am not happy about what we have in Afghanistan and in the air.
We have around 90% of the soldiers and equipment, which we need, and this is too little, 'de Hoop said at the end of the Reuters dreitägiger talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved is also dispute over the last few months, whether all the allies in Afghanistan give their best.
Has been criticised for passivity, for example, Germany.
'The Germans are relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the Kampfanforderungen they are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, 'Gates said.
The British Boulevardzeitung 'Sun' has described this week, the German soldiers as lazy.
'Afghan Nichtstuer unmasked: the Germans do play games, while our fight boys' wrote the 'Sun' in a contribution, which was supplemented by photographs German soldiers who Tischtennis.
The German Bildzeitung was preparing for a counter-attack printed and a picture of a UK unity in a rugby-competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt in the year 2009 to one billion boost
In any Czechs have a national debt of SEK 84000 lapses.
The Gesamtschuld up until the end of September on 842,7 billion kronor.
The government had planned to get into debt with Konen 159,2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced thanks to the better development of state Hauhaltspolitik 152,8 billion in the plan.
The debt of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September on 842,7 billion kronor.
Within the first nine months of this year it rose, consequently, 40,2 billion.
However, they fell since June 13,4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed so that its information on the debt of at the beginning of October.
In any Czechs a fault is from 84000 kronor.
Over the last year, the State indebted by more than SEK Miliarden 111.
Thus it now seems that we thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year will be the limit of one billion kronor possibly until the year 2009.
Next year the debts should be moving between 900 billion and a billion Danish kroner, 'David Marek, analysts of Patria achieve said, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, it is Vladimír Pikora, analysts the Next achieve: 'The exceeding of one trillion we could, in the course of the year 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget, we do not yet know.
If it should emerge that the situation on the political stage should be amended, and the politicians ready to save more, could take up to the year 2010.
Such an amendment, but I do not think, 'he said.
Debt grow,
The national debt is of the debts of the State government and above all from the accumulation of deficits of the budget.
The national debt is financed by Schatzanweisungen, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt rose this year now 719,4 billion kronor.
The external debt of the State now rose at 1.7 billion kronor on 123,3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached at the end of September 803,3 billion kronor and sank since June at 13,7 billion.
The average Fälligkeit of public debt rose to 6.5 years.
'The Gesamtschuld beyond the year rose from the first to the third quarter by 13%, which is really much in the light of how good it is the economy.
It is interesting that the increase in unemployment is above all in the bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It is a bad thing that the debt is increasing, but on the other hand, this shows that we can do something, even before the reform of pensions is, 'Pikora commenting on the data.
Better than expected
From the financing strategy and dealing with the public debt for 2007, it is clear that the government had planned for this year to include 159,2 billion kronor.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced thanks to the better development of state Hauhaltspolitik the plan to 152,8 billion kronor.
This amount is above all by the state budget deficits, which will achieve this year clearly 76 billion kronor instead of the estimated 91,3 billion.
It is a maximum of resources for the Konsolidierungsagentur EUR 13,3 billion kronor, a Zehnmilliardenreserve to the payment of pensions, the financing of Staatsschuldverschreibungen for 43 billion and rates for the planned for loans to the European Investment Bank in the order of EUR 1.8 billion.
To this end, that it has given a Teddybären a name that she was today, a court in Khartoum.
For the British teacher their lawyer, which was charged in Sudan because insult of Islam, has been sentenced on Thursday evening, by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British have been accused, as long as six to seven-year pupils to have allowed to give the name of a Teddybären Mahomet, even though it is prohibits any presentation of the Islamic chaos.
It would have to be deserves contempt.
After parents had complained of pupils in the Sudanese Kultusministerium several times, was the 54-year-old Grundschullehrerin, which was in the Unity High School of Khartoum, taken up on Sunday at home and under Rule 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code of Islam accused the insult.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher in their calls for as long as six to seven-year pupils, select a name to the Klassenteddy.
 The children are proposing eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed , Robert Boules headmasters.
Finally, as the class votes, choose 20 of 23 children Mohammed rather than first names.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Mohammed, but also and above all a in Sudan very frequent first name.
Subsequently, the children have produced a book for the class, with the photograph of the bears out and the Bildunterschrift  my name is Mohammed .
The bear itself was not a shield with this name, but the problem is, quite simply, that the presentation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim fellow Members that Gillian Gibbons, informed on the same school in Sudan, said that he knew it well, and they would never have done something, and they could enter a religious faith to  I only regret that it has asked the children to vote for a name , its opinion, it is only a   innocent mistakes.
An opinion which share a number of pupils teacher, describe this as  very carefully and to their pupils   person who never speaks in the class  about religion.
It should be noted that the first name Mohammed is, at the same time, the second most in Great Britain's Zweitname exist for the 14 different Schreibweisen in English.
This often by Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a sort of the prophet (it is often given the Erstgeborenen a family).
But, as the rules with regard to the use of this Vornamens be?
Should we, for example, give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, it was during the last Verhandlungssitzung in Vienna to an agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo Wednesday morning, have brought in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final Diskussionssitzung, without being able to their controversy on the future status of the separatist province.
 It is regrettable that the parties have been able to reach agreement on the status of , the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger stated in a press conference in Vienna.
With an emphasis on the fact that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to honour its commitments to the preservation of peace, and continuing the talks on the end of the negotiations.
It is to be expected  no violence in the immediate future, but we  are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there is a perfectly clear tensions.
At the end of the conciliation procedure on 10 December
The agents of the troika, which the European Union, the USA and Russia together, will be meeting on Monday one last time in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% of the Albanian speakers inhabited province could be clearer when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit until 10 December her report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, in the vicinity of Vienna, formed the sixth and final Verhandlungssitzung since last August, the troika of the UN mission to a new conciliation has received.
The Americans and Europeans expect that will end their Vermittlungsauftrag on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of the independence of Kosovo in the Security Council, also insist on a continuation of the negotiations on this final date.
Russia has  and advocates of a negotiated solution, a friendly solution  remains Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of?
After the Kosovo has spent eight years under the administration of the United Nations, the Western countries keep the independence under supervision by the EU for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce this one-sided, if the Security Council should not decide on their behalf.
Belgrade is greater autonomy.
Very briefly   no agreement could be reached, the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu announced, in the hotel in Baden, where these  negotiations of the last chance, since Monday  led.
Postulated Thaçi, a former leaders of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister told the province of regret.
He added, however, that the proposed plan for autonomy of Belgrade  belong to the past, which has led to the murders and deportations .
  domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, for its part, was of the opinion that a compromise was desirable, and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo before the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province.
Belgrade thinks that it particularly fürchet a 'domino effect', in a region that is so much by the weak Unabhängigkeitskriege of the 1990s.
 for Serbia does not mean that a compromise would be impossible , he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision will be taken solely and exclusively solely in the Security Council, where the Russian ally holds a right of veto.
 Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word 
 is only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council for Serbia  acceptable, the Serbian Prime Minister Kostunica Vojislav said.
 these negotiations have taken two years.
They must end up, as they have started: in the Security Council. 
The journalists Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the   status, and added that any unilateral declaration will be from the Albanian-speaking population   in coordination with the western countries.

A risky withdrawal, because of its duration, the removal of bewohnbaren modules, the speed with which he has been organised and the  astronauts from the gebastelten  tools, to carry out the repair, has made several records.
The problem in came into force on Wednesday, when the astronauts Harmony had pushed the module by the Raumfähre Discovery, a great zylinderförmiges part that will soon be up and the European and Japanese scientific laboratory.
This is a kind of module Landungsbrücke for the module-laboratory.
But we must be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 tonnes of heavy module on electricity Sonnenkollektoren, which was already on the ISS, to bring it in its final position.

And Scott Parazynski was selected, at the end of the 30 metres long arm of the remote-controlled Raumfähre that had been made to the station, to walk around, to carry out the repair.
He is one of the best  Spacewalker  (Wetraumgänger NASA).

Of the 46-jähirige skilled doctor has been selected to    Sonnenkollektor violated the  operate.
Having assessed the damage, he by separated the flawed cable and hard on the damaged a kind of railways.
He was of a second  Spacewalker  who was in the vicinity of the channel, supported and, from inside the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin the occupation.
The tool that he used, a mini-Hockeyschläger umwickelt with Isolator to prevent the Sonnenkollektoren, several hundred kV produce an electrical blow, had conceived the astronauts on board the station and   procedures.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the Kollektor was fully aufgefaltet before he abzählte its tools and the station returned back.

The election of the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be in the counting of the ballot box exciting: the bulk of the Russians will change for President Putin ’ s party, decide Vereintes Russia.
After a very abgeriegelten campaign it confirms its quest for stability, even after authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin is a public television channels in the news in gaining access to the electorate, which has been recorded, whose content is kept secret, however.
He does so in his capacity as lead the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin-party, which was announced a stunning victory.
Yesterday, the President has nothing suggests, when he received the foreign embassies, and to provide a new target against the western powers, the accused of meddling; his favourite subject during the election campaign was.
We are aware of the price  a true democracy and we hope that honest elections, very clear and open elections without  fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, since they have missed.
It deplores the oppression-spattered election campaign.
The Communist leaders Guennadi Ziouganov says, it would never been  such dirty elections, not even  at the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of demonstrations last weekend, for ex-substantial degree from remilitarisation Garry Kasparovder illegally for Demonstrieren was sentenced to five days in prison, according to his lawyer Besuchsverbot.
The Russians have  the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus 
After these elections without much tension two further raises questions:
Who will take up  Putin ’ s successor as President?
The Amtszeitung announced yesterday, the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have to make to 23 December time.
Since it was re-elected in 2000 and 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third term of office in consequence.
And now a successor to take place.
What role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister,?
The chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party Vereintes Russia to choose the government and President?
What will be there, in the parliamentary or in the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
Is a tradition.
The Russians  the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus have preserved, they are not  masters of their own destiny, the sociologist Lev Goudkov, Director of the Independent thinks Levada centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov by the State University of St Petersburg goes even further back: civil society has evolved in this country, which has been christianisiert five centuries to Europe, only very slowly, the famous Community spirit which has delayed development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s Putin was needed to the model of a paternalistic State, which has been accepted by the population, all the more so, because to this new paternalism, followed by a terror, but a degree of economic prosperity, Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation thinks.
Today, the Russians do     voluntarily to the personal responsibility, which they have laid after the collapse of the USSR short-lived.
For a long time yet consider  What? 
This is a phenomenon that affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
And the Verwaltungselite understands it to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian Regionsvorsitzenden), the local lists of United Russia to lead.
The new, from the West next freedoms are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
For the general public stability.
In this sense, the Russians will also vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a fifty-year-old teacher: for a long time yet consider  What?
Those who are in power, are not so bad, why they replace? 
A serious memory

This decision after the ratification process has been completed, the opening up, since yesterday, is valid.
A sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct investigations,   above all about the deportations of prisoners, the occupants of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced labour, Reto masters, head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently were still a number of Member States, including Germany against this anonymous-related documents for the public, because of the sensitive nature of some information.
As, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability some Deportationsopfer.
The Insassenlisten the concentration camps, or the Gestapo warrants have been issued after the war have been saved from a practical reason: civilians, who were deported or been subject to forced labour, and to provide the necessary evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for them to their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen with more than 300 permanent, tens of thousands of personal questions.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community is only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.

Consequently, the stock exchange according to experts will have a rather more lateralen, influenced by fluctuations Kurstrend,  above all because we are not even able to assess the scale of the possible reduction in the cost of the Federal Reserve, some uncertainty is due mainly to the increase in the price of crude oil and the risk of the rise in inflation. 

The Mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of alleged participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested on this morning the current mayor of the town of belonging Stadtgemeinde Murcia Totano (People's Party), given the urgency suspected of involvement in urban corruption, which has been identified this week.
In addition, have been arrested one of the secretaries of the parish council and the leader of the community policing.
José Martínez last May Andreo representing the office of Juan Morales, are currently Members of the Partido Popular and at that time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information received from the radio station Cadena SER be the original organisers of the plot.
The officials from the Geschäftsunterlagen not to continue examining the community and the Ministry for planning and further arrests in the coming hours.
It was also accused of being a lawyer by Juan Morales, to him at the beginning of this week in the case of discovered städtebaulicher corruption.
According to information from the Cadena SER  was the advocate of  popular and, consequently, Mr Juan Morales privileged arrested as his client of residence because important piece of incriminating documents which will be in connection with the plot.
In addition to other sources of the alleged Auftragszahlungen Morales of a galizisches construction company, which has been produced by the conclusion of an urban Treaty, decided in the building of a 200 hectares of large area.
At present, eight people are remanded in custody.
Bono agreed to the candidature of the PSOE in Toledo and to adopt an election victory for, in the Congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has the offer by the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and consequently, it will make the list of the PSOE-candidates in the next general election in Toledo and, in the event of an electoral victory of the socialists, the office of the Kongresspräsidenten.
We have José Blanco, Organisationssekretär the PSOE and Bono announced in the press conference, after a meeting with Mr Zapatero took place today in the headquarters of the party.
In the view of the Heads of Government the offer is justified to the former ministers, because it is in the policy  important to be able to count on the best  and Bono is among the best . 
In addition, the politicians originating from the Mancha it would in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the forthcoming elections appear   as chairman of the Congress of the party to stand.
As Mr Martín Bono would replace Kongresspräsidenten this announced on 15 November last year to participate in the next general election not do more to put an end to his career in the public policy and for climate protection instead to in the university field.
The former minister had to admit that the Regierungspräsident would have since his resignation, two years ago, on his return continually pushed to the political scene.
Furthermore, he pointed out that the party, as for the economy, not on the appointment of the Vice-President, deprived of the citizens, who would in the event of an election victory for the post of Kongresspräsidenten and   described this as an act of transparency.
If he is actually the office, so he hopes the chamber  in a House of respect and not transform the insult or the diatribe  to make it seem that the citizens is similar . 
Very briefly  from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where we cannot talk in Madrid calmly and quietly, the Congress and the Senate Regierungspräsident was suspended until 26, once again. 
At the same time, he  praised the current President, Mr Martín and  his good work and indicated that he does not want to give the impression that the office to have already accepted, otherwise his political opponents would call this   arrogance.
Klimapropaganda
Since the Klimadebatte both the sceptics of climate change, as well as those who put forward a social and political debate in the foreground, a merciless criticism review, the movement as whole a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement to which, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet  .
However, this proposal will bring it in Erklärungsnot concerning the action, or non-action of his government, which has contributed significantly that Spain is within the EU at the top of the list of countries which have complied with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance with the rules on the sectors it is due, and why its government, which had proposed the  contract with the planet  has not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now having to explain the Spanish citizens of the planned measures against climate change, without hypocrisy.
What companies be affected, the kind of behaviour of the citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what economic consequences will be.
To be more precise, who will pay sacrifice and the need to save the planet.
However, it has and in future, there will be no such statements.
It is precisely because it is: the Aufopfern and.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change in real terms, are unpopular.
They are cost-rich, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE proposed petrol-cent seemed Zapatero seen electoral strategically so dangerous that he has been forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is important now is to save the planet with nothing, in other words with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, committees and committees, protocols and new posts.
With its agreements with the planet for election campaigns of the appropriate politicians should not talk, denounce, calling for even, instead, the challenging issue but look to dress up the meeting with enthusiasm and with its gentle patience and kindness others.
But this will only happen if the Treaty does not diverted from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not claim that the bicycle in future will ease the only, or we must erfrischen only with a subjects.

What is the best insurance for me?
The motor vehicle insurance covering a potential disaster caused by drivers, wiederrum contains a high cost, whose level of various factors, etc., depends, among other things, of their age, sex, the drawing up of the driving licence, marital or family status, the nature of the insured cars and its use,
To have a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate motor vehicle insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell.
First of all, there must be a clear that what we are dealing with here.
A mine is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders.
This agreement will be written by means of a contract, which is to establish that society will the agreed Versicherungsprämie and committed in return to submit the appropriate Abfindungssumme when a disaster.
The Versicherungsprämie is the cost of insurance, which is made up by several factors, including their age, sex, the drawing up of the driving licence, marital or family status, type of vehicle insured or use.
The insurance companies are setting their prices in line with the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due to a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, must both on 25-year-old children and women less contributions, because statistics show that these groups with a smaller accident rate, thanks to their caution.
The same also applies for married people, since these are, according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that the companies to fewer accidents as Alleinstehende.
The benefits which is attached to the vehicle, affect the frequency and hence also the probability of an accident.
The more the use, the more likely the damage.
In the drafting of the insurance premium a whole series of points must be taken into account.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation carefully, precisely in order to select the mine that responds to his personal needs.
At this point we statistics now are the most important points which we should learn in the selection of insurance, in order to be able to not only efficient but also a make price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds to take on the choice of cheap insurance to many obstacles, such as, for example, the poor and the young   driving licence.
Even if it would be an ideal cover for the best to conclude a Vollkaskoversicherung, however, there are cheaper alternatives.
The tentative drivers can select Vollkasko with an exemption, so that the benefits of a Vollkaskoversicherung be covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of treaty means that the consumer has to pay a part of the damage incurred by the amount.
 The amount will be set before the end of the Treaty and on the basis of the amount of Versicherungsprämie and it is the smaller the  higher to bezahlende sum, Luis Noguera, main exponents of Spain in First declared Europe, a Vermittlungsunternehmen for online insurance.
The other option is the enlarged insurance, the insured against external Unfallschäden customers, but not on their own car incurred damage.
Furthermore, it would cover this type of insurance theft, fire and Fahrzeugverlust.
There is a Council.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hands, to reduce the costs of insurance; increase your credit advice by versuchst to drive carefully and to prevent accidents.
A credit advice is a reduction in the basic standard tariff in the insurance company.
On the contrary, a Strafzahlung implies an increase in the tariff will be applied.
The amount  credits and total penalty depends on the society and their returns.
If the company has a good year behind it, it can  allow itself to increase the no-payment Noguera, explained.
As soon as the 25-year-threshold is exceeded, it is easier to conclude a treaty for the drivers. Reason for this is the fact that the accident rate is falling, with growing driving.
It is therefore best to opt for a Vollkaskoversicherung with excesses.
Normally vote  young people can derive any benefit from their experience, both  in the event of an accident and not at the time of the well explained to the Spanish Vorsteher of European company, and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr after the  fear of Anfängers  has been given.
Nevertheless, it is possible for a married customers, which is not to conclude children, better, a Vollkaskoversicherung; of course, it is only the financial situation of the person in question.
From the insurers are married couples with children as customers, with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low for their contributions.
In this case, with an exemption would be Vollkaskoversicherung (with an amount to EUR 300), the best option, in the event that it has received a high credit advice, an enlarged insurance, which is only the third Fahrzeugjahr recommends.
As a whole more relaxed  you go and have a greater purchasing power, the  it allows them to a higher contributions, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is with a Vollkaskoversicherung exemption () in order to a sum of EUR 150, or conclude an enlarged insurance, which uses only when a sufficiently high credit advice.
In the end, it is necessary to point out that the mine something very important, not only because it protects the driver Unfallschäden against potential, but also because it entails high costs, making it necessary that a thorough choice is made, which is in line with our personal situation.
The Glasgow Celtic Football Club in Milan, hopes to the point for Achtelfinale
Were the Milan and will fight Glasgow Celtic Football Club next Tuesday in San Siro at the point which is missing from them to achieve their objectives before the end of the Championsleague-Vorrunde.

New fears about Erdgasstreit between Russia and Ukraine
A new Preisstreit smouldering between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports are affected by fuel in Western Europe.
The largest part of the Russian Erdgasexporte in the European Union (EU) will be guided by the Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations will be monitored very closely.
Kiev warned that Moscow has to be increased if the price we have to pay for the gas, make it higher Transitgebühren by Russia.
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies in the Member States of the EU.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow to achieve what is happening at a time of the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State Gasmonopol Gazprom try to reach agreement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008.
According to the Gazprom Ukraine must be calculated, as agreed by the company had to 50% to pay extra for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay for 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
'It is important for us to use our arguments, as one of the main Gastransitstaaten during talks', the Minister of Economic Affairs Ukraine Anatoly Kinakh Reuters said.
'The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked with our arguments on the level of Transitgebühren [] on Ukraine to Western Europe'.
In the last major Erdgasstreit between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom supplies cut in Ukraine.
This resulted in a result on a case of exports to Western Europe, what pushing prices high.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas underdeveloped, but much remains.
The consequence is that Gazprom with its own supplies gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian complements former Soviet nations.

It concerns black also said that the Scottish public health service, no precise ideas on with regard to the number of its ausländischischen staff.

Although the health authorities Disclosure Vorstrafenregistern Scotland to use the Agency does not have the power to obtain this information outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the Hauptprüfers now states, alongside other recommendations that the Bureau should take up guidelines of the Strafregisterauszugs, which is helping employers in controls in different countries.
'whilst we in some Personalunterlagen references to these controls, these were not routinely screen.' was the report.
Black said, the Scottish health authorities would their Untersuchungsrichtlinien before the employment to a large extent, but added: 'Our report shows in areas in which the system can be improved, in order to guarantee that precise information on the number of foreign Gesundheitsdienstmitarbeiter available.'
Dr Peter BMA Scotland-chairman Terry Wynn said it is extremely unlikely ', that would identify investigations in the run-up to the employment potential NHS-people who could hold future terrorist attacks.
'In the report states that current Voranstellungstests the NHS Scotland well and it is not clear what added value will provide the recommendations,' he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they have at the moment 1.161 foreign staff, the vast majority of doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is probably higher, because of the management problems would have to identify those staff who are beurlaubt indefinitely.
The study found that established control of NHS authorities have been complied with in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and mainly Lothian.
These include passports, Arbeitserlaubnis- and Qualifikationskontrollen.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia because of a Terrorkomplotts
Saudi Arabia has revealed yesterday that it has 208 Militante arrested because of their belonging to cells, who had planned an imminent attack on a Ölanlage and secular and security forces.
State television of the world ’ s biggest Erdölexporteurs said that one of the planned in cells would, missiles.
Supporters of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, since 2003, which is an ally of the United States, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A unit of eight Militanten, led by a foreign nationals, an attack on an plante Ölanlage in the eastern province, after the Fernsehbericht.
Saudi Arabia is to protect a 35 000 strong rapid Eingreifstruppe formed by a misslungenen Anlagennach Al Qaida-attack on the world ’ s biggest Erdölverarbeitungsanlage in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to a innenministerliche statement says that 18 of the detainees were part of a cell, which was chaired by a 'Raketenexperten', the einwanderte illegally into the country.
He reported that the Militanten had planned, in eight Projektile in the UK.
Further 22 of the detainees had, according to the report, to kill priests and security forces.
The government has warned clergy to do more in order to put a stop to Saudi Arabia, which want to strive for Iraq together with Al-Qaeda militia, the fight against the Allied forces and the US supported Shia Muslim government, which is viewed by the Saudis Hardliners under the Sunni heretical.
Al Qaeda militias many members of the clergy in Saudi Arabia and genuinely in cooperation with the authorities in the support of the policy of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias, accompanied by calls for Osama bin Laden, the Al-Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia leaders, be it on the Saudi government prowestliche - have on foreign housing estates, government buildings and installations of the energy sector apart.

Among those arrested also 32 people accused were to have asked the militias financial support available.
The climate of Venus could see a glimpse of the future of the earth can
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists have said yesterday.
Data into orbit of European Raumschiffes show that the planet is a abgewandten Zwilling the world even more than was deliberately so far.
The Venus is the näheste planetarische neighbour of the planet.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar Planetenbahnen, however, the Venus the sun is in a little more detail.
Billions of years before the Venus prevailed conditions, which would have been very similar to those in the world and could even be habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere with the sun and slower Rotationstempo Venus followed a very different Entwicklungskurs.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has an annual average surface temperature to melt, which is heiss enough, lead and has been devastated by hurricane-strong winds and Blitzstürmen.
The findings of the spacecraft Venus Express the European Space Agency, which has examined the planet for one year, offer a sobering look at how the earth could develop in view of the disastrous effects of climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics Oxford University, one of the head of the mission Venus Express, said: 'It is clear why the climate of Venus is so different to the earth, while the planet are very similar otherwise'.
'Our new data, it will be possible to devise a scenario in which the Venus began billion of years as the earth, possibly with a bewohnbarer environment'.
'Angereichertes uranium "seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports, depleted uranium, has been seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A Polizeisprecher said that three people were arrested and that the material will be examined.
He does not confirmed, whether it was depleted uranium, but said that there are 1 million dollars (sold for £480,000).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said that he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a Schneemann.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency agreed at the end of the day, a debate on YouTube, include in the ordinary voters questions on video and table to send it to the candidates.
Any of the questions which have been raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were so ridiculous as the Schneemann, interviewed on global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers spiegelten precisely at this time, the state of the republican party, which is on his way in the elections next year.
It is not known, as well as the producers of CNN, sometimes fail the debate, which identified the potential candidates to zeigenden YouTube Clips.
However, in the first half-hour of debate, the longest was devoted to a different issue, immigration in the heart.
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of hybrid voters to operate a Wählscheibe if they heard things liked them: the television station said leaders of the approval of the candidates as strictly on the borders.
The ultimate and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leaders, and Romney, has shelved in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forward.
Tried Giuliani shake the reputation, he had been lax about illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
He was attacking Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts, illegal immigrants to have to work on his house.
The two dealt particularly violent as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support a 'amnesty' (the illegal immigrants) would be a regular status and the opportunity to citizenship.
Relatively unimportant candidates as Duncan Hunter, a kalifornischer Kongressabgeordneter and Tom Tancredo, a Kongressabgeordneter from Colorado managed to persevere with this issue.
None of the two men has serious opportunities in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been hacked earlier and harder than other on the Immigrationspauke.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: more stringent limits, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world to help the Republicans to forget or to minimise the differences between the Liberal and Christian Conservatives.
However, the debate has clearly problematic than other issues have been raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he Waffenrestriktionen supported in the past.
John MacKein and Romney discussed whether simuliertes drowning should be seen as torture.
One of the honourable Member asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This meant that Giuliani was of the opinion that, although the Bible should be privileged book he believed the history of Jonah and the Wal perhaps not literally.
Another honourable Member asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - contrary to all expectations, in the first place, in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to its long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty painful, but is necessary.
When he was urged, whether they would be in favour of Jesus, he said was lachte and intelligent Jesus to apply for a political office.
Extraordinary the race remains open.
Huckabees rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Pauls recent Spendenerfolgen and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate by Wednesday.
These two are high kicked out of nothing, because the two wing of the party do not yet have been unable to agree on one of the better known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the outset and convincing together with winning a message on the size of the USA and a Zwinkern on both arms of the party.
This time, has divided the party and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered a further hole the Hineinfallen; his way out of that remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly schlüpfrig.
No title seem to be sold, paid any politician Paris Hotelrechnungen, been no wedlock gelutscht 'toes.
But the discovery that a rich businessman donations for the British Labour Government on more than £1.3 million dollars 650.000 () on four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to notify this is something without which would be thousands of disputed territory of Gordon Brown well.
As the Prime Minister had two months ago, escaped the demand for an election dämliche way on the intelligence of British offensive by he claimed that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision, there were would hope that it will provide a strong, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly insightful Vertretungsvorsitzende the Liberal Democrats, said, Mr Brown, feared by Stalin once to Mr Bean.
The heavy-handed saving Northern rock, a failing bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgement under attack.
Ill thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have business groups against the government.
The tax system of loss of the personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative Pfuschereien.
A trio of generals retired to be launched an uprising in the House of Lords in protest at cuts of military expenditure: ministers of the armed forces, so they claimed, is a Teilzeitjob.
There is now the diverse donations of David Abraham; Mr Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and their former Erfüllungsleiter) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocable direction departure is on his way.
However, to govern governments to achieve a turning point, after which they find it impossible.
Neither politicians may people trust, but they are normally their scepticism, if a new force takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and it needs to be not even a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to be leaking; while the cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise; the press is bad news, and the government is defensive and no ambition.
In a way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because it can in contrast to other political leaders cannot claim to be a new Besen.
So it would be to deny Tony Blair, he was lieutenant.
The problems with Northern rock and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen, for example, are, together with decisions as Chancellor Brown met the Treasury.
And it was not even if directly involved in Missgeschicke Blair, as in the case of long 'money for title' -Untersuchung of political parties - the voters are perhaps the fact that he was it.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The errors are not so terrible, such as the Conservatives describe it.
As for Mr Bean, no one has ever died, or has been beschwindelt.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to supply, which have of course Brown Stalinist tendencies always pledged: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new political gesture donation is a good example.
The garboeske Abraham, compares its donations, with its non-profit-making gifts, he says, do not want any public recognition for its goodwill.
That may be so, but the decision was not him.
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they exist from a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he would know Abraham agreement, but not that it is illegal, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's Hauptfinanzeintreiber, on the odd donations has been told in October will of course have to ask some questions.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of this confusion, although most of the payments has been made his appointment in June.
To date, the Prime Minister has finished half of the work.
He has condemned the violation of the law by his party, but he watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the issue - to make this measure, a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the 'lessons to be learned from' are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things must make Mr Brown, as something to find a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which is for the last six months vacant, and to proceed with a radical reform of political parties.
It would require the hard-liners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party such as Mr Brown.
However, it should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to restore voters; and the only way it can achieve a victory, is indisputable rectitude and sound competence.
Kartenhaie
Is the American Kreditkrise Kreditkartenmarkt?
If blood is in the water, it is only natural that Rückenflossen herumwirbeln wildly.
Where America now that we have the predators have the Kreditkartenmarkt of the country in the sights.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect the could achieve Kreditkartenverluste 99 billion dollars, if the risk of infection spreading of under-funded loans to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten.
Signs of the tension are obvious.
There are increases in both the Ausbuchungen Säumnisraten as well, which are measuring the percentage of loans, the late each einziehbar or not more than 30 days.
The HSBC has announced last month, that it has a 1.4 billion dollars taken from their American Verbraucherfinanzierungen charging, partly because of the weakness of Kreditkartennehmern.
It is still too early to indulge in panic.
Losses and Säumnisse are still low.
According to the Ratingagentur Moody the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point under the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American Privatinsolvenzrechtsgesetzen in 2005 has led to a dramatic case of Konkursanmeldungen, once again for the (account for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of applications and thus Säumnisgebühren) would rise again whether the general conditions for the worse borrowers or not.
The industry also reports of solid Zahlungsraten, which show how much of their debts consumers every month abbezahlen
And confidence in credit karten-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of the structured funding.
Dennis Moroney the TowerGroup, a research companies, expects the Ausgabemengen will be for 2007 at the end of the day, 25% higher than last year.
Direct Infektionskanäle between the Immobilienkreditkrise and the Kreditkartenmarkt there is undoubtedly: it is more likely that consumers include Kreditkartenschulden, now that Eigenheimkredite dry up.
But the issuers will look at the Geldfluss Kapitalwerte, therefore, not necessarily solve Hauspreise falling from a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
They can even be for the issuers of advantage.
The incentives for falling consumer to pay Hypothekenraten, if the buildings are less value than the value of the loan; as a result of the Kartenschulden Rückzahlungsprioritäten amongst the more important.
Issuers will also be able to react more quickly and much more flexible than the lender stürmischeren conditions by interest rates or Kreditgrenzen change.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of the assets.
"We will not wake up one day and assess the loans completely new ', Gary Perlin says, Ones Hauptfinanzreferent plans.
Even if a sudden Unterdeckungskrise Kreditkartenmarkt is unlikely to the risks of a sustainable slowdown are real.
If lower Hauspreise Kreditminderung America and a push the recession, the industry will certainly face a grimmigeren future.
They continue to keep looking for these fins of sharks.

It was the day before the Erntedankfest when Ronald Livingston by the great Glasfenster Little saw the Just a Healthier restaurants here and observed as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod stopped two further down the doors to the West Scott Avenue.
Soon a Polizeiauto was there.
And then another was there.
'then I saw the medical Leichenbeschauers Kastenwagen over the' Livingston said, a Aufsichtsperson the restaurants, on Wednesday.
'The was the point, as I knew that someone had died.

The authorities have not yet established what Mrs Arroyos death has caused, and that toxokologische investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death are hopeful, who sent out a sorrow Führungspitze Newark by the police.
Mrs Arroyo since September 2006 was an assistant of Polizeidirektors, Garry F. McCarthy, and their voice was many in the department.
'You was loyal, hard hauliers and persistent', Mr McCarthy on Mrs Arroyo said in a Telephoninterview on Wednesday.
You was my Pitbull.
They beschützte me. '
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo Mrs by Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officers, was for the Alkoholkontrollkomission works, and that they are two sons, 14 and 11, and a Stieftochter leaves.

And they have been on a Sofa Mrs Arroyo.

Two Mountainbikes reflected by snags on one side.
McCarthy said that for the first time as he arrived in Newark, after 25 years with the New York Polizeidepartement had spent, was Mrs Arroyo invaluable and helped him here in the insular and harsh political culture in its new city survive.

'You was always here, when I arrived here and it was always here, as I was.
It was embarrassing. '
Hopes that the Central Bank will cut interest rates lead to the increase in the Weltaktienmärkte
The shares sprangen yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after Markthoffnungen that the Central Bank will have been trying to reassure the Kreditmärkte by further to reduce interest rates, beschwichtigende comments by the US all reinforced by the Central Bank.
The stock markets in London, in New York and in the whole of Europe after Donald Kahn, who said No 2 by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Central Bank, that the policy must 'respond flexibly and pragmatic' to the constant pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear attempt to reassure verdrießliche markets, in view of the sign of emerging Kreditspannungen, Kohn said, the recent upheaval would 'partially Marktfunktionen some of the improvements made by the late part of the September and October vice versa'.
There should be increased unrest caused remain, it would increase the possibility of a further tightening of the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments have been taken up by investors as a sign that the Central Bank is prepared to intervene and to stabilise with new injections of capital markets in the US and potential further interest rates the borrowing.
What also helped to reassure the Wall Street, with the addition of bad news from the American economy, now that the sales of US property achieved a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil, the announcement by Bear Stearns, Investmentbank, stressed that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of their international workers, in a measure to reduce costs, to compensate for heavy losses from their lost Wetten Hypothekenkreditesektor in the US.
It is to be expected that disappear only 20 of these posts in London, where the bank employed 1 500 staff.

The pressure on the Bank of England, to follow the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and feed in the money markets further Kapitalmittel in London has increased, as we saw the Kreditspannungen the three-month "Libor '-Raten Leihen between the UK banks with 6,59% on their Höchstes since the late September, after a constant increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements made by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to propose a No 6 for Kandy England in this weekend Owais or Shah Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, Wahlvorsitzende to call at least under this specific title, is here, to decide, in order to help the Cheftrainer Peter Michael Vaughan Moores and the captain, and because the table of high Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national Wählerämter, if not even for what part-time work.
Anyone who has not always the sixth Schlägerposition will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is without doubt it.
It is never easy to apply exactly what a person at the top of its Berufszweiges, while someone else will never, on the lowest status, sometimes due to a lack of good will.
It is not only in the cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are always at the end of subjective.
Is it the right time to forge ahead Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he is doing this?
The same may be needed in a further area if, for example, John Edwards or 'Tubby' Banerjee, both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good qualifications are familiar with the business.
Who can say what the right class, is for a cricketers, unless it is given the opportunity to swim or submerged.
Of course, numbers have a major influence on decisions, but also have opportunities.
Within a team a cricketers must catch the eye of the master of the ship at the right time, if he can take a Wicket and a bat regular opportunities must be given in order, if he wants to make as a one-day cricketers impression.
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson, apparently, which will be the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared itself for healthy and as the wind kegelt in the networks.
Anderson, 32 a first-class Wickets with 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their high points and hope to even more.
Or whether Shah Bopara Asgiriya plays in stage, can only be a Ansichtsfrage.
The election could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in each test and has been successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs but that it was Paul Collingwood, then kämpfend to consolidate, managed to a significant breakthrough Testkricketspieler and, even though he punktete a dual hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.
That will probably Graveney, Vaughan Moores and, after a further discussion in the context of the current Netzsitzung Asgiriya stage in its Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl Shahs will follow for more experience on Boparas young enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
He speaks for Shah funkelnden and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Mumbai, 43 first-class Bopara hundreds and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent record against angedrehtes bullets.
But Shah only ten Runs in its two Innings against the West Indies in May on the test in Lord, its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus the immediate rejection of the Auswählern than Vaughan healthy was to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his fighting, which was still in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the Alleskönner from Essex has schaufelweise vibrancy.
It is not a Kricketplatz impressed on the sidelines, and its attitude has come to the point, when he recently had a car with an exhibition Vierradantrieb Volkswagen sponsor of England.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was also, of course, be Vodaphone (gesponsort) and its Teamkollegen Alastair Cook, monitoring of this from a distance and enthusiastically to say: "Have you seen? '.
Bopara is a much better Feldspieler that he be kegelt Mitteltempo here with some effect on the playing fields, which seems to fit to him and proposes with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man one thing to choose the right moment is another.
Perhaps that is the real art of choice.
I am inclined to give his chance Bopara now, which does not mean that will be left Shah may not be a good idea if he is the person who, as the Teesatz from Sri Lanka suggested, play this weekend.
Buses are refugees back to work to combat - and Al-Qaida
The first Busladungen Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, ended with an influx of displaced persons whose funds or Visas, and others who hoped that the city of return to normality.
Some even back in order to combat the rebels, which they were forced to leave their homes.
On the bus depot Mansour before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official Regierungskonvoi of a dozen buses, was the terminal they were industrious with refugees from Syria and Jordan, which were returned to Privattransporten.
'I have decided to go to Syria, having killed many doctors in Baghdad', Al-Sabah Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor said.
'I came back today, because what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspapers about what has happened in Baghdad and, as it would now be safe.'
They say that the Mahdi-army have ceased to kill people ', he said that in relation to the Schiitenmilizen of militant Klerikers Moqtada Al-Sadr City, has ordered his forces at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old schiitischer teachers from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned to work with his two children, because he was unable to rebuild his Syrian visa and because the regime Iraqis is not permitted.
Its Shia neighbours in Amariyah called on him to drive him to say that a local, supported by the United States militia has helped to Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the West, capital and information to return to it.
One of the newcomers from Jordan the leader of a Shiite Sunni and regrettable that had been expelled from his home in Baghdad Sleikh in the north by a grenade attack was after he had asked his fellow citizens to combat Al-Qaidas.
He was back in order to fight.
'Before two days ago, some of my friends to me and told me that it began the anti-al-Qa'ida militia Sleikh and that they need in my support and that of my boys.
That is why I am back 'Sabaah Alu Obeidi, said 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital, since the US Truppenerhöhung and the growth in local 'groups affected citizens', which defend armed and in cooperation with the American military in their neighbourhoods.
But more said, to have been forced by Visumsprobleme home and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a three-year-old 51 of father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, the Syrian Government had asked, Visumbeschränkungen to impose the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are probably fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
'We it was good to al-al-Maliki urged to Syria and the government to give the Iraqi people no longer issuing visas to force them to return to Iraq', the Sunni pensioners said.
'I cannot be trusted a government which supports the criminals, the my house burned down, after I went away'.
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnis driven from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which has led to the creation of many places where have remained tensions.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up sectarian tensions and will lead to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
Is the smallest province of vocational training is a leader and even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a Bildungsfeld the Saarländer expresses the same deficit as the rest of the country.
'I have heeded said yesterday on the 50th anniversary a Nichtsaarländer that we are not French' - this slogan plakatiert even the smallest province of irony on his 50th birthday.
In France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarlands, it is in the Bildungsmonitor of the Institute of the German economy Cologne (IW) to place five.
The universities from tradition cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The university in 1948 Saarbrücken was set up by the French.
Up until now, students can complete their studies here with a double or even Dreifachdiplom.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students with 15.6 per cent.
But also the Landeskinder the Saar in on average number of universities - many of them without a conclusion on secondary school.
'In the Saar making use of the professional education' Axel Plünnecke, the Bildungsexperte IW says.
More than one in five young people buys his Studienberechtigung from a vocational school, so that the Saar is more than seven points above the Bundesdurchschnitt.
The combinations of vocational and academic training are developed comparatively strong.
In terms of the population with dual courses for the equipment is the second-best in Germany.
In spite of the practical training and rising demand the number of Ingenieurabsolventen has fallen in recent years, however, by a third.
That is why the Ministry of Education saarländische has committed universities now to a Marketingkampagne engineering for scientific subjects.
'On the generally-building schools we have initiated after the first PISA study a number of reforms', says a spokesperson for the Bildungsministeriums.
So the government a comparative tests nationwide.
In order for the children to learn to start before the last Kita-year is free of charge – a model that now copying other Federal Länder.
Whether improve the performance of the pupils, will only be replaced in the future.
In 2003, the proportion of the Pisa Risikoschüler fell from 29 to 20%.
Overall, the Saar whipped up but not as strong as other Member States.
Count the Bavaria better.
And the anger of the Pisa Saarländer Fremdsprachenkenntnise in not be measured - otherwise score in this area.
Because the language of our neighbours in secondary schools duty - even if the Saarländer are not French.
The clocks Chávez is
Soon in Venezuela time passes differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez can turn the timer in the Southern Cone country by half an hour.
In Spain is to Witzfigur Chávez meanwhile.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela stated, the clocks according to a new law on the minus stopped from four and a half hours.
So the südamerikansiche State gets a zone which exist in any other country in the world.
The US hostile Chavez justified its decision, among other things, that the United States in the world would have imposed on the classification of zones to full hours.
Furthermore, Chavez announced on Wednesday (Ortszeit) for a Geiselaffäre announced the breakdown of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia.
The Linksnationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe still President of Colombia, he will have neither the Head of State, nor to the Colombian Government relations.
'I cannot do it alone, because my dignity' Chavez that drives a constitutional reform, on the vote on the citizens of Öllandes on Sunday in a referendum must said.
With the reform it would increase its power in the country.
The origin of the dispute, the Uribe's decision was Chavez to withdraw the mandate for negotiations with Marxist guerrillas in Colombia, where it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe was roll Venezuela with its decision 'nose' Chavez criticised on Sunday.
Also in Spain Chavez is on everyone's lips.
A new mobile phone-Klingelton wrapped up in the country: 'Por qué no te callas' (why he thought you not the mouth) is the sentence that have already more than half a million people downloaded from the Internet.
Talk of Spain King Juan Carlos, which was at the recent Latin America summit of the permanent carping Linkspopulisten appalled and driven this via the mouth was has it.
In 2007 Lohnminus German
Despite the strong economy German workers is a prediction that this year a Reallohnverlust.
Experts called a whole range of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of Hans-Böckler Foundation for the workers in 2007 could count on the real Gehaltskonto with less than in the previous year.
'is to blame the modest wage trends, the Mehrwertsteuererhöhung and Preisschübe in food and energy' Gustavus Horn by the Institute for macro-economics and Konjunkturforschung 'image' -Zeitung said.
New burdens could also have in the Wages Guarantee Fund to workers.
Finance ministers peer Steinbrück said of the 'Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung', the planned reduction in the Wages Guarantee Fund at the turn of 3.3% in the current situation is right and sensible.
However, the Bundesagentur should not be used for work again embarrassed to have to ask for the Confederation of credit or subsidies, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday, that the Preisexplosion in food and oil-based fuels forced the rate of inflation, at the highest level since 13 years ago was leaked.
The prices rose to 3.0% as a whole in terms.
Is the vicious Venus Zwilling the world
Is the Venus, despite their live the earth's atmosphere hostile similar thought than we have up to now: the European spacecraft 'Venus Express' has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and Windwirbel in Poland, as they appear in the winter, also on the planet.
For almost three decades of scientists suggest that it blitzt on Venus.
Now the European probe 'Venus Express has shown - they sensed electromagnetic waves on the fringes of the atmosphere: the lightning Venus shoot at a level of around 56 kilometres of cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in scientific magazine' Nature '.
According to the famous' Ursuppen theory 'lightning arise life on earth have: storm should suggested in the ocean reactions which have led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: 'If there has ever been life there, it must be in the very early history', Sean Solomon Carnegie declared by the institution in Washington.
Today, the atmosphere is around a hundred times more heavily than in the world should be there on the surface of the Venus barely alive: there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
'The Venus is perhaps the Teufelszwilling throughout the world, but it is a Zwilling' Russell said.
Why is the Venus, the earth in mass and size is a similar has taken such a completely different development, is the fundamental issue of the Esa-mission.
The launch of 'Venus Express' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research, as was not probe since the beginning of the 1990s, specifically in the field of research into more of this planet.
The latest research which will be presented in a number of 'Nature' -Artikeln, underline the researchers are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
'you also show that we have in common with our Nachbarplaneten are greater than the world's first adopted', shares the Esa.
The researchers in addition to the already well-known in the North Pole there have also been a whirlwind Wolkenstrudel on Südpol, is much more quickly.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of Luftströme on the abasing worldly Winterhemisphäre, writes a research team Piccioni by the Italian process by Giuseppe Di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second central planet the solar system has virtually the same as the earth and there is in diameter 12.100 kilometres almost as.
The planet Abendstern Morgen- or as described in less than five days ago under the sun.
It is, however, much slower themselves: a Venustag takes 243 Erdentage.
Although the Venus with Oberflächentemperaturen 460 degrees and a pressure from 92 reminds cash in the earth, researchers claim that both planet have arisen in very similar circumstances.
On both water collected, at the same time, in the oceans of the world, but on Venus was lost in the space.
And while carbon dioxide in Karbonatgesteinen fixated on the planet, from Venus it makes on the majority of the atmosphere.
Defended Köhler Merkels meeting with the Dalai Lama
Horst Köhler Parteienstreits calls for an end to the reception of the Dalai Lama in Kanzleramt.
He criticised the SPD indirectly because of their attacks on the Kanzlerin after the meeting in September.
Horst Köhler cares about the reputation of Germany and has urged the major coalition to put an end to the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
'We should present the outside world in this matter is not divided nation' Köhler said the Handelsblatt.
At the same time Köhler understanding signalled to the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor, Angela Merkel, (CDU) in September.
'The human rights have for me Köhler universal validity, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures, "said.
Everyone knows that Germany in the foreign policy must maintain sensitive balances stressed, the Federal President, but Merkel predates the accusation that they devote myself to a new policy on China.
'The Federal Chancellor has not taken far from the traditional one-China policy.
This also know China ', said Köhler.
The Foreign Minister, Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier (PSE) was indirectly recognise dissatisfaction regarding the receipt of the Dalai Lama and has therefore been attacked from ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, the 'Schaufensterpolitik' of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalaï Lama in Kanzleramt there was considerable confusion in the German-Chinese relationship.
So the Chinese leadership has not only keep the German Finance Minister peer Steinbrück (PSE), but also SPIEGEL frozen, according to information received from the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has now called upon to admit the receipt of the Dalaï Lama as a mistake.
China reject it if European politicians officially received in the religious leaders of the Tibetans Wen Jiabao confirmed, the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalaï Lama showed that he is trying, Tibet and the further Tibetan region, today the other provinces, "guilty 'of China.
Before Mr Schäuble warns riots in France
Street fighting with the police bullets, burning cars, Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany is not entlade in violence on the streets of the Interior.
Barricades brannten, troublemaker soared with Schrotflinten on the police: after the serious Jugendkrawallen in France Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany is afraid that a similar development.
"We have to take care that we do not also underpins social upheaval and delivering in violence.
We have to take this seriously, 'he said the published in Hanover' new press'.
Not every young person rightly come with the rapid change in the social reality.
Union, countries and communities already worked with vigour, reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This concerns not only the integration of migrants.
'From Islamkonferenz Integration Summit to the first successes shows.'
For sound the all-clear it is too early, however.
At the same time, Mr Schäuble pointed out that it in German suburbs not urban and social problems such as in France.
In northern Paris suburbs of young people in the last few nights street serious had supplied with the police.
Also in Toulouse brannten cars and public buildings.
However, the Federal German Government called for greater integration of the leader of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France Kolat 'Nachahmungseffekten warned'.
The situation in Germany is not as sensitive as in France.
Nevertheless, there is a need to act.
Kolat pointed out, that the unemployment rate is migrant among young people under 25 years' abnormally high '.
Above all, it must be ensured for more apprenticeships.
Kolat said: 'We have to give young people a future'.
The leader of the Turkish community added but, more than in Germany, in France will find a 'social control in the families'.
Many young people migrant also wanted to do not destroy what have built their parents here.
Kolat was: 'But, however, we must be careful.
We need to give the young people 'quickly the opportunity to participate in work and training'.
In the meantime, it was in the night in the Paris-le-Bel suburb Villiers largely calm.
The police Hundertschaften were at work, a helicopter was flying with Scheinwerfern on the area.
The competent authorities registered three arrests and a few burning dustbin and cars.
Since the previous day, a array of around 1 000 security forces provides for peace.
The police will be for as long as is necessary, Michelle Innenministerin Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night in around 80 policemen were in riots in Villiers-le-Bel been violated.
In the Folgenacht the unrest in Toulouse on seized.
The riots entzündeten in a road accident, in which young people were on Sunday two died.
The initial findings of the Public Prosecutor of the police force is not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the poor by Angela cloud
The reality of the appearance of the Kanzlerin documented that the coalition content is in the end - and that it is nothing to expect more.
In what country the Chancellor live in?
After its miserable appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag was wurschtig and content of the poor, we should say: not here - not in the country governed by their at long last.
The accusation that they concentrate too much on the foreign policy, Angela Merkel rejected by a furiously arrogant sentence.
This is provinziell, they said, and it only so that they do not want to understand what we are talking about the critics.
It has been well documented in the Bundestag there for all to see, as is their.
Yet neither concrete interest to feel a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela appeared cloud: a deposed politician, who is pouring in foreign policy and even there remains Ungefähren.
Climate change example: as they are excessively praises the decisions taken in Heiligendamm for, but not, as in the climate objectives are to be achieved.
The fact that so much Unbescheidenheit Selbstlob - the CDU-Chefin would have failed, two years ago.
Now it is clinging to the phrase that the recovery out to the people.
So they do damage to its image as Pragmatikerin which will solve problems, rather than embellish the world.
But in the realm of Angela cloud internal problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty and the concerns of the low?
For a few Nebensätze has left.
In this respect, how often it promises, as it concerns the Kinderzuschlag is significant.
Three occasions since needs Merkel to deliver a more or less funnily sentence.
They only as in other people's ground if it is specifically.
Attack department,
In the debate of the republican Youtube the two presidential candidates favourites Rudy Giuliani Mitt Romney and provide a harsh blows fear - and now have a Außenseiterkandidaten.
The strain of the candidates to delivering the first issue.
He has made a New York 'sanctuary for illegal immigrants' Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This in turn kontert with serious allegations: 'I would say, its own house was a port to illegal immigrants' You've Giuliani, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without papers.
The upshot of the candidates to attack: because the Republican basis still has no clear favourites, the eight Präsidentschaftsanwärter use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The rolling 30 seconds cassettes, via the Internet users have eingesandt Youtube, are little more than Stichwortgeber.
'With this type of isolationism, we have come to power Hitler', John accuses McCain his opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the Round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
This is also the veterans Romney Vietnam really have read, when he refuses, the so-called '‘ water boarding ’', a Verhörmethode simuliert in Ertränken, rather than condemning torture.
That is the major issues of the campaign, but now on the other side of war in Iraq and Folterdebatten demonstrate the reactions of the Saalpublikums in St Petersburg in Floridas.
Whenever conservative values and rejected for future tax increases in the audience Applause on brandet.
This shows once again, where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
'I have made a mistake me at the time, declared Romney zerknirscht and in Abbitte Fernsehpublikum basis and to ensure that, in 1994, he was still the Abtreibungsbefürwortern.
On the other hand, is Giuliani foundering, as he will be asked for its opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time in civil, General Musharraf governed
One day after his resignation as army chief of the Pakistani authorities is sworn in as President Musharraf.
For eight years end military regime in Pakistan.
Pervez Pakistan President Musharraf is sworn in on Thursday for a further five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television gave the ceremony in the presidential palace of capital Islamabad openly.
Musharraf was said to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as to his army chief confidants Ashfaq Kiyani and in particular to international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless coup of the former General now governed first time as civilian Head of State.
With his resignation as Oberbefehleshaber Musharraf of the armed forces had met a key demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency, the Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Soon after being sworn in according to the Attorney-General Musharraf will lift Malik Muhammad Qayyum the state of emergency and perform a further demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, the Musharraf was filled after the declaration of a state of emergency at the beginning of November with him weighted lawyers, was rejected last week, all the objections to the controversial re-election of the Heads of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were in the northern Stammesregion North-want an attack on a further four Militärkonvoi killed and injured.
According to a bomb exploded Armeesprechers on a street close to the border with Afghanistan.
The founding fathers of the Krautrock return
The German Supergruppe musiziert Siebziger: the three Bandmitglieder of Harmonia before their Konsolen themselves in a concert in Berlin.
To its great Mitschnitt Revival a time 'Live seems to 1974'.
Even then, they were much famous abroad.
Seeking sensation occurred in the form of three gesetzter gentlemen in the Abendtafel.
Everyone has to be boxes, its cable and, above all, his Knöpfe.
In Mr Dieter Moebius thront blüten white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
The left accompanied by Michael Rother, 57 years in possession of young and laptop and Gitarre.
Justice, regarded by the audience, is krümmt Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrated in the Konsole.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a Beat.
And sometimes it is accidentally to a traditional piece of music.
Then it seems not to disturb the gentlemen itself.
That the bond musiziert Harmonia again, has been under Krautrock-Liebhabern for some excitement.
But we must condemn here: targeted enquiries revealed that, although the name schwirrte through collective Popgedächtnis, but not to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should not also the German his living myths from the seventies should celebrate?
Because what is misleading Krautrock, in England and America has always been more than in their own country.
As the Musikwirtschaft gave the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003 echo-price for the work that we saw in the Chamber in fragende German Popgesichter.
As the Red Chili Peppers trying in the hymn of praise on the band La Düsseldorf and New, bedankten knew that the surprise no borders.
In concerts Michael Rother hockte later in the Red Chili Peppers trying on the stage as an old mate.
The problem of the ignorance at home and the 'naïve optimism on this point in the foreigners is one thing.

Richard Gere is simply not enough cynical
'The Hunting Party' and 'Mörderischer peace' two films deal with the war in the Balkans.
But both are not convincing.
Either the ideas put too much on Action and Geballer or sentimental but they are.
Since Richard Gere in 'The Hunting Party can not' help.
The good news first: it is true that the war criminals hide Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, now the actors Richard Gere has been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s least, because too many nice-irrelevant roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and too many press conferences on the subject of austrieben Buddhism, the desire for inspection.
Now all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument, The Hunting Party - if the hunters will 'Gejagten' (Why must always be those actually so long and confusing as driver-collective agreements?) perhaps look at.
It provides a wonderfully augenzwinkernde presentation: basically, be Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt is what has become of Gere if the destiny and the cinematographic sector would not be so gnädig: a man who has its very best for long periods, but as a monument to preserve its decline ruinen the same considerable vestiges of the former charm.
However, despite this Trumpfes The Hunting Party is', together with the German production 'Mörderischer peace', which is also, this week, only the endless series of failed Balkans war-films.
With 'Mörderischer peace' we can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), a Serbin before Kosovar Heckenschützen save what a love promptly in it.
Although it is a good thing that the Serbs are not only as the root of all evil, the fernsehflache film loses itself too quickly into Geballer and Action.
It is a kind of 'to sound the alarm for Cobra 11' without motorway but with war.
On the other hand, research is to 'The Hunting Party' is an example of why there has never actually been a true good Balkan Kriegsfilm.
The history of three US Kriegsreportern which seek to open the Serbian Oberkriegsverbrecher 'of the fox', with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both in one Richard Shepard) can at a different time perhaps a new 'Apocalypse Now'.
Because the stories are indeed striking: both times are small team in the forest, in order to achieve something which the military cannot and on both occasions there will be a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of 'The Hunting Party' is that we do not simply Simon Hunt the cynics can be run with heart when he will be presented to us at the beginning.
No, it must also Script andichten him a romantic affair, with a later Muslim Bosnierin murdered.
Ultimately 'The Hunting Party' then sold down the river, catch if the reporters within the last five minutes Zeitrafferverfahren succeed in what NATO, CIA Kopfgeldjäger and all the world have not achieved in five years: the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that we want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a very human concerns.
It intends to denounce that Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic still rumlaufen freely, and he suspected of the Americans and the French (here they are meant to be an exception and sometimes agreed) to promote the persecution on the grounds of secret political agreements not too.
But the good and evil Gemeinte are sometimes so similar to that is a famous Brecht-poem.
It says on the Holzmaske an Asian Dämons on the Arbeitstisch the poet: 'Mitfühlend I see the geschwollenen Stirnadern, andeutend: how demanding it is to be a bad'.
Films as' The Hunting Party 'have to be precisely for such Schwellköpfe which indicate but, as it is demanding.
The problem is not limited to the Genre of Balkankriegsfilms.
Recently, that all Iraq Hollywoods films were great Flops has been in this newspaper report.
We can add: there has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: if a Star driving around on the trouble spots or minefields the world, then something is out, such as "Rangoon dismisses' with Patricia Arquette 'Jenseits all frontiers with Angelina Jolie or' blood diamonds' with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It may be that all the conflicts are simply time to close.
It has taken after decades before Hollywood could go with 'Schindlers list' a good film on the Holocaust.
Some film is mature may still be in force - the now as a classic Vietnam works' The Deer Hunter ',' Apocalypse Now 'or' full Metal jacket 'celebrated at the time are masterpieces as unanimously.
But perhaps we know today, where everyone is mass murder in real time on two screens at home also quite simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And this is undermining the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories.
'continued existence, or otherwise, of' or 'The great dictator' of course have become so much is because Lubitsch and still Chaplin did not know how serious the Nazi regime was genuinely.
Perhaps we should not want to be good, if we want to make good films.
Perhaps we must have the sarcasm Künstlerblick distancing of Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.
As has been consulted on the parallels between its historical novel 'Lemprières dictionary' and the Balkan conflict, he said: 'It is only that there are a number of things which never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people are being murdered in horrifying way and there will be always war in Yugoslavia '.
By reaping Beust criticism of Olympia-rejection
The withdrawal of the mayor of the application for the Olympic Hamburgs Sommerspiele is in politics and the economy of criticism.
Many people want to continue to fight for the Games on water.
But by Beust realism on the assessment of the opportunities of calls.
Of the Chamber of Commerce, Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday, described as a 'is not good for the economy'.
No other project have developed in recent times as great in the city of Motivationskräfte as the Olympiaidee.
'If this objective of sports political momentum would not be able to be maintained at the same level. "
Schmidt-Trenz called for the Senate to burying the project, but to find a new long-term approach, the result of a modified Zeitstrahl '.
Ole Mayor of Beust remained on Wednesday in previous statements to the effect that the Olympiaambitionen Hamburgs are at least until the year 2028 unrealistic.
'It is not Hamburg decides on a Olympiabewerbung, but the German Olympic Sports Association, "said of Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the for the beginning of December expected decision of the Munich Sportbunds on an application for the Winter Olympics 2018.
'This preference means for us is that we will have to date by us in the proposed period up to 2028 any realistic opportunities.'
Nevertheless, the dream was not ausgeträumt for all time, said of Beust.
The hamburgers Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements by Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg wants to apply in the next 25 years, no more for the Olympic Games.
It is too early to exclude a chance, buried by the plans already at this stage 'HSB-President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is also contrary to the statement of the Senatschefs Empfanges at a time of the General Assembly of the general Germans Hochschulsportverbandes.
That is where the application of Beust Hamburgs have called for the Universiade 2015 'not as a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had nominated only last week, Hamburg as a candidate.
The SPD Bürgerschaftsfraktion accused before the Senate not to have used the valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
'The development of small Grasbrooks has been delayed for years by the Senate, because he has put on the card Olympia and excluded housing said', the SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD have always called for the small Grasbrook integrated planning for Olympia and a subsequent Wohnnutzung, have the CDU set unilaterally to the 'fact factor'.
The application of the Summer Olympics 2012 at the time in Hamburg, gave rise to a great deal of enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg, failed to Leipzig.
These are not Warhols cases
Anyone who combines the concepts of Sweden and Holzkiste, thinks of Ikea, but not in Andy Warhol.
Or it?
Currently, in Sweden fabrizierte Holzkisten cast dark shadow over Warhols Werkverzeichnis.
A large proportion of the vierundneunzig Brillo boxes listed in the 'type Stockholm' are counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen' a few months ago, doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols has fuelled Brillo boxes of 1968, internal investigations in Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: the six 'Brillo-boxes' which the former Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museet 1995 Hungary Constantine, copies are - and I think the majority of around one hundred further Brillo boxes' the type of Stockholm ', which are on the international art market.
The background is verschachtelt, a confusing string of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York, his first 'Brillo-boxes' bemalte Holzkisten based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard Seifenpulvers' Brillo '.
His work in an exhibition Moderna Museet from 1968 was - Warhols agreement, with hundreds of Brillo-from cardboard boxes: these reasons) (were not Warhol, but they have been impossible to directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik.
It was not a question of works of art, but whose models, a mere exhibits.
At the same time, probably in 1968 Warhol has given permission to produce a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden, which have not been issued in Moderna Museet.
All witness to speak now about fifteen boxes, which are then as authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-boxes with the term 'type Stockholm' right in the art and Auktionsgeschichte.
Some of them have achieved at auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that the legendary Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later, be it produces around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden and has been issued, the Warhol then have to leave him.
In fact, 105 cases have been Hulténs produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At this time it was three years Warhol dead.
Lars Byström, Chefkonservator on Moderna Museet, in addition to the six museum own Brillo-boxes three examined from the Swedish privately, two of which have been carried out in 1968 in Stockholm: their Pressspanplatten grundiert abgeschmirgelt were first and then, white Ölfarbe was entrusted with a Pinsel.
The structure of the copies from 1990 against reveals that the colour was entrusted with a Malerrolle without Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte - it is not a question of oil, but Acrylfarbe.
'This cases have not been authorised by the artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes ", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, said:' If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will define the six cases in its collection as copies / Ausstellungsmaterial. '
In July, the Authentication Board has announced to investigate the serious accusations', in terms of the Seifenpulver-boxes.
But since then, it remains unerbittliches in silence.
