Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Law, the project of cancelling the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
Members have rejected at second reading the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the ex-première Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for disadvantageous reached an agreement in principle with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, and the Court should rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December.
Tymosenko describes the political judgment of revenge of the regime and was also a suspicion of bias of the court process to the West.
The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-premère Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 members.
It would have required 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already defeated.
Muammar kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
It is to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the election winners are the Islamists, but is it moderate or radicals.
The Interim National Council declared the custom of Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya is a country without a crime for a flight you cut the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, not respect any Dela faith are punishable by the death penalty...
It is the Koran that will join the personality of the dictator society with tribes opposed.
In Libya be such an order as we can not represent him and we would certainly not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted the aid with recognition of dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that it is not a américian general who led the NATO bombing But Allah They hailed the greatness in every attack.
When it comes to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not one
We have participated in firing, served Islam and our poilitiques have turned the dictator as a political ally without brings no benefit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily, Libya.
So there is no problem for the premises to débarasser "crusaders."
Does without occupation of soil, the oil companies have easily accés libyien black gold.
Perhaps not as much and the West will eventually claim the desintéressée protection of human rights.
If we prevent these followers of the sharia.

Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students of colleges and universities have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
By doing so they want to support their country's nuclear program about a possible Israeli attack.
Students came to pray at Noon at the site and then had hoped the death and Israel.
A couple of hundred students from universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear Technology Centre, which is processed uranium.
They have openly expressed that they would defend the programme nuclaire of their country at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA said in its latest information that Iran continues to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
It is widely reported in Israel for a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Food of a child obese: do not take breakfast and is used in processed meat for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have the problem of overweight, 9% of écoliersont above average weight and 5% are obese.
As the current research show the obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important is the environment in which the human being and operates the models that surround it.
On the tables of obese children for example used in processed meat is 50% more often than in the families of the normal weight children.
19% of obese had frites for dinner in the investigation with awareness "Obesity is not a chance '
In the families of small big sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% said that at least once a week active parents found the time to move.
Survey 900 children
The investigation took place during the last school year and 900 primary school pupils from the Czech Republic have participated.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence," action supported by general health insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning is more 12000 sixth in the third pupils who have registered for this project.
One of the factors that led to a dramatic rise in the number of children overweight or obese, is the lack of proper food and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children interviewed says for example eat small déjeuner-en - Lunch - 5 times a day goûter- dinner, which is a basic principles of good food," says one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and charcuterie for dinner
Experts point out that to have a healthy development there is some basic details such as a breakfast in a family at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of pupils' families eat at the same time.
In most of the families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not take breakfast at all.
The daily Breakfast is the basis of good nutrition.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of Obese children it consumes more often frites unhealthy.
Almost every pupil - not to mention the weight - drink every day sucrées drinks of 70%.
More than 40% of the children interviewed the sport regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepares you your diet
Another part of the investigation has allowed children chosen - 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools to prepare its own food from possibilities presented according to their own taste and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children are far from 12 to 15 years, the plan of a healthy diet, the ideal."
Among their favourite dishes there are many cakes, meat and sweets.
"The more alarming is a big win for the limonades sucrées, indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch the pasta who took the first place just before the white meat.
Children do not want féculents and the preference for meals fish and vegetables was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are prepared to change their habits as soon as they receive the relevant information.
"In a review of a group of participants in the survey who had fulfilled the questionnaire after the awareness session" Obesity is not a chance, "There has assité a determined to move to a healthy diet," will show the results of the investigation.
The most striking was for example for the limonades sucrées because children have started to give preference to drinking water.
Children are more often ticked off the questionnaire white meat and fish as flat principal and reduce the sweet dishes and the knedliky spécialté Czech boulettes meal of bread or potatoes.
The designer has to be a good psychologist, says the professionals
Presentation in an article on the way to learn for the stylistes, I put a little bit angry because there were many from the start.
I do not think about what would happen afterwards.
The statements of three professionals of the specialty clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are over the samedis and Sundays is truly "filled."
This time we have with the Director alenka - in there is no boy treated in the way to rob the woman who has no statistics standards.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, no particular curve, another overweight.
The designer must know how optiquement ammenuiser arms wide, prolonging a neck or add the necessary Phillips.
We have managed to highlight described the man and not to pay all too obvious types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hanches said, and a fine size.
If there is such a difference between the size and the hanches so that the skirts or trousers are not at all, this is the time to do it on.
And you will regret not because clothing which is impeccablement is priceless.
In a tailored skirt you feel much better in that slides continuously, enroule and does not take the belts and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a clothing style Tucker, with bits of tissue cousus, or even broderies.
There is obviously a lot of various examples of appearances and I am glad that I have a whole week to separate all the information received.
But I also fear that, because of what I should do at home there too.
Each trainee received celebrity, to pay for the day and night.
We must take into account the current appearance, the kind of way of personality and his appearance.
I will "pay" Miranda Kerr, that you may know of the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Basically, it gives me pleasure because it is better to pay Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost 100 kilos in recent times - do not take my statement svp, completely seriously - or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cease and coudre from magazines or try on the Internet, print and work on graphisme.
The moodboard, as we say in the final outcome, expresses our personal style graphics and our relationship with the establishment.
Graphics also reflect on the part of styling is also important.
The designer can not rob and only the physical but productive creates for example the pages in magazines, on products given the trends for the handbags, coats, etc...
Mario kamenik, designer and graphiste, we had it all.
But this... until Sunday
The designer must have an overview
Three guests from the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the session on Saturday with information about the different types of characters.
Honza pokorny, designer, Jakub polanka graphiste mode and Ben renc, photographer of fashion.
Jakub has reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know it.
And a designer of talent can work with a single clothing in different ways.
The variation is paramount for this example.
Such as this trench-coat which must be brought in Classic with a Jean and a T-shirt as a light coat but also it can pay the naked body, with escarpins and taking the photograph as a habit '.
Or just up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"play with it," he said.
But I was particularly pleased with the Council that "for the work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to infringe," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why they are trying to learn these Rules, where, what to do with why, when in the fashion magazines sometimes you see something else.
No statement on the marches of fashion.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have many more varieties of clothes that are photographiées.
This is to say that for fashion story that will take a dozen pages, a dozen models - I must be ready for "retailler" at least a fortnight.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with this during a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half of the succés has been confirmed by Honza pokorny.
Just look at Madonna is not a great singer, but his image and marketing have turned it into a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach towards the use of services stylistes remains cautious.
And sometimes faces regard them as useless - it is that I know something but I parais happening in the second row.
And if someone is a styling from us, then we must rely on the fact that it is governing with a high likelihood a completely different size - smaller than it has in fact.
Then we have to sail on Google and be sure if the wide avenue are state of the infos famous, if it has maigri or stresses etc...
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the core that it is not enough to move in the fashion designer and assemble models.
He must communicate with the people it habille and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
: guess the people not to pander to retain its opinion.
"When a manager asks you to separate its storage cupboard and meet new things you can not just throw everything and say, my God horror."
"You will find few cases that you find pretty and that you conseillerez what them," said Mario.
It has shown us precisely what must contain what is known as the "placovka" or bag of designer.
Is that you cling on the size and on course for everything you need.
Also things clearly defined as the scissors, the rouleaux for dépilation or the épingles nourrice, there is also the beginning of nylon - the designer uses for photographier products such as bags, or many hats, special clips with which closes a dress in the back, if it is too large - the pin or other type of agrafe are not utlisables because they could abîmer clothing - or a couture kit.
So that we soyions not only people listening but who tried something in practice they have taught us how ressemeller properly shoes.
And in the photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the semelle could abîmer, particularly at lextérieur.
And so we have put and put.
We did not have the right to reach the scissors inadvertently not to be injured.
We must therefore skills.
Mario was good when he congratulated me for my creation.
My comptence State is not for my copine.
This is only a brief summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of course
I am increasingly understand that make the styling a profession is not a promenade in a garden of roses, everyone says what he wants.
The need to speed the run dispute across America.
Review
Originally a race without problem due to a series of errors become stupid people who do not have to make a matinal routine trip to work.
It fills up to some extent the ambition to everyone but it is no use if no one wants to do something more.
The new Part sous-titrée the run produced great expectations before his exit.
He promised to take a new direction, with the series race need for 'speed already old and out a kind of' game from the parties jouables does not consist only with points.
So we were curious how the parts will be added, in which the main hero out of his car and does what it wants.
As this is already in the series NFS, the result is completely different from the one atttendait.
This potentially games of arcades but the whole race draws down due to some unnecessary errors that already exist for several years.
They are not really mistakes but rather an expression of idleness incomprehensible from developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has caractériels problems and addressing them is to participate in illegal racing across America.
You asseyez behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco, and your job is to be the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting points.
The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
Which means that each race is on a different route and the steps planned in different environments that stand quite far from each other and are worthwhile.
The player did not believe for one moment that the game offered something similar.
Some environments are also quite beautiful even if the graphics technical level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert in the autumn landscapes or in highly covered in snow is very nice visuellement mountains.
The tests are more from time to time agrémentées atypical of a élement.
For example in the desert you end up in a sand storm you substantially reduced visibility.
Then in the mountains, you must pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
Alongside these different races are put together properly behind each other.
There are only a small number but it is enough.
There are moments you seek to surpass the required number of opponents - as in a classic - then you chase race against the clock - classic duel with the clock - and then still awaits you another duel with an adversary.
From time to time you also the police coming into the game and tries to make the situation dificile.
The novelty is places outside the vehicle.
It is rather una interactive animation when most of the time Jack enfuit before someone goes through life and you must help by banging on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments like this that you expect - to be concrete there are only three.
The result is that because this is not likely to hinder and is, in the context described above, in what agrémentent the game.
The code of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but we can not say that it is negative.
For the simulation realistic you will see elsewhere.
But that we could find better in the conccurrence model of conduct goes very well with the kind of design of racing.
So everything is OK.
The problems start to appear after a certain time.
Has the diffférence the code of conduct, the collisions is still not right.
We do not expect this game a complicated distortion and collisions, but when you have not, during a collision with any subject, the slightest idea of How does your car, so this is not completely right.
During the up close, you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car in the voltiges crazy.
Or is in tatters.
Through the recovery system that is not really a problem, but you really agace.
The recovery is so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the stage the game you back during the last point along the route.
But you do not only have 5 redémarrages.
When you used the 5 redémarrages you must start the game from the start.
It is more a tool, if something is not done properly, seen on which you can really count AN.
Sometimes the redémarrages do not help the memory and we must find a solution remémorrant piece of route.
The major fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are certain however that it must move in a way or it is not.
Otherwise you meet on a given place of vehicles "civilian" still in the same situation that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late.
What will anger the situations when you see move easily between two oncoming cars opponent and when you arrive, you, you need to be set aside and the conturner or curb.
It is equal, if you go out to him because it is "calculated" in such a way that the situation there always comes very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During the time of the game, you again, you arrive in some places, regardless of the time, and you always have the same opponent before you in the same place.
This getting nervous as at the end of game When you going on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The enemy must at all costs through you.
When he does to you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you go on a collision course a number of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you ennuyez quickly.
And it is a shame, because through a simple code of conduct the game is interesting and the places with such action that you do not have the time to follow everything that is happening.
And this is equal, if it is because of the unique concept of 50 routes, that the order of racing is such that there is no chance of being boring or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during races.
You must pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars, however, most of the time that you enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for American cities, gas-guzzlers for motorways and the super sports cars to exotic clothes right on the lacet conducted very technical, for example on the roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are specific races in places that you know of the journey goes very well with the regime's main history.
You get not only the medals but also experience points to add to your profile is common challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects are starting to unlock:
It connects online with the Office autolog which among other compare your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the Community.
One of the hardest blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the game.
You arrive with your car in the underground tunnel - it seems - where you going in the dark on the tracks, it seems.
Your speed indicator you said between 150 and 200 km / h in principle and behind you is a subway Rame sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
Has the production we had a discussion for a few days to know if anyone has really thought in the creation of this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical side of the game is not a bonus, but the visual part is generally good and in some cases really super.
Which hampers is that in more extreme situations, the image is not the level and in some cases in a tragic way.
This is especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid can serve no imaging.
The noise is good and the runway is the choice.
In order to please the most people and particularly the most noise the young audience a new runway has been created in the style of "I mix everything," but it is expected that no one will buy the stake for music.
General impression of need for 'speed: the run' really is confused.
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game seemed not to be finished.
The amusement is really well but prepare you for the mistakes has dwelt in the eye with the force of a réflecteur aérodrome.

Vicenova, near the européeenne Union: Ambassador
The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions'
"I do not expect a war as tough."
"This last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all the players get used to their new role ', as miléna vicenova began his speech at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador around the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relationship so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of lecturers at the Faculty of Law at the University should also Charles could envy, it has shown that it takes its motto "understandable and openly about Europe very seriously."
Mrs vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning résonnaient criticisms that it is bland, that this is a rond-de-cuir, it can not rempplir mission and I must say that It has cut the inspiration for everyone because it takes its role to Perfection."
"This is a man who knows listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe."
She said the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in an answer to the question: "Who is that the European Union?" 'So what should I call? "telephone number, as an important step towards unity and greater clarity of the Union's policy against the states such as China or India.
No one wants to prevent us our syrecky - feels very strong cheese to pulp cooked -
Mrs vicenova reported the agenda that has experienced, lives and lives in a time near the European Council.
She called the Czech presidency of succés two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis, or have organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She called the fall of the gourvernement very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is very busy at the moment.
According to Mrs ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" Not only for the presidency but also to solve the financial crisis that continues to again now.
It must also approve the new EU budget septimal which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be small and to economies, what branch will take priority, which countries will be helped the most, least, everything has to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador reiterated its slogans with which it came to Brussels for a Europe "understandable."
"I do not really like the abbreviations, foreign words, the jargons that no one understands.
As should understand that it is true that the citizen in Brussels round person does cornichons or play, bananas differemment large or that nobody has prohibited to make syrecky. "
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
We have a multispeed Europe
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being the Eurosceptics and people who do things that in their negative aspect more positively.
In addition it is sorry to see if a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she says, due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support for the Czech.
In addition to a Czech Presidency to succés She then emphasized the strength and the cooperation of Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I come to the Poles, the French Magyar, Slovak, it said, and that is that you are there, that is still the Visegrad group?" and it is not at all happy. "
According to Mrs vicenova, in the near future are tough new rules on fiscal policy that await the member countries.
This is the concept of a two speeds, if not at different speeds, prevailing rather than a "new European federation."
"We have countries in the euro zone and others out of the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Cooperation."
First it was said that working together the countries that want it and those who do not want to remain in their corner. "
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly at two speeds," Mrs vicenova expects Europe.
From this point of view it was also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van rompuye to determine the foundations that all issues that impact on the EU must be discussed among all the members of the EU and not just the memebres of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If anyone were to seek term which is close to the closest IBM, would be "long term strategy."
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, however, is a firm considered very present and since its inception has passed 100 years.
The basis of this long term strategy has been thrown by the head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.
Its slogan "Believe!" has become the footprint around which to develop the life of a future - and also the title of the giant IBM began to éditer in 1935 internal magazine.
That was the basis of the culture of the company soignement drafted by Watson.
Continuous for us IBM means thinking long term movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because she always remained true to its core values and however has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This has allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century, we get even more "has délaré for the anniversary of the current Director of The Samuel J. Palmisano company.
A system well prepared
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of its employees as Bata in Czech Republic - people of IBM employees were the only among the first Americans to have the holidays paid insurance paid by the employer plus a uniform of employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and the commmerciaux.
In the same way IBM has a relationship with the customer sytème well developed.
Society was initially inspired in the discovery of talents- as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have a choice.
An anti-discrimination current plan is completely in the spirit of the strategy because it will be a femme- Virginia rometty - who should replace Palmisano the head of IBM.
It works for IBM for thirty years and currently holds the post of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, the brain- storming online from what is from a future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly half a million people who work there.
An institution with a good name
Internal and external is the image of the company to provide a secure position in the fields of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology company," said rosabeth moss kanter, economics professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM.
"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps to solve the problems of the world of business, using its technology," added Italian geogre colony of the firm consulting Forrester research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue," as it is known as the United States because of its slogan- 100 years it has grown to become one of the world's largest companies.
This is obviously the most versatile - it develops software technology company, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, advisory services in the server products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents on all American technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings stands for example the distributor notes, the financial payment card, the swap, the bar code or the disquette.
IBM has been this year with $220 billion the second largest technology company in the market capitalisation, the first is Apple, Microsoft when for the first time it dépassa in 1996.
Overview ahead
It is not all the innovations and who had the customer's preference and manufacture of the time - for example, IBM has failed the bet on an operational system own bones / 2 miracle online service or the IBM computer pcjr:
"When your business is built on the movement in advance you can not émotionellement remain stuck in the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
Why IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms, and when they do not work it out.
Unlike for example of the conccurent Microsoft at the basis is and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
IBM, services, who are trained in the income for a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
Still in 1990 it was more of the motié participation with the most representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM has sold assets with low yields for $15 billion, in cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of Technology Perspectives.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has outstripped the new financial crisis.
IBM according to the dictates of negotiating its head Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased the amount of investment.
Now it transpires that IBM is the current crisis without being harassed.
The price of the IBM has progessé rocket 120 percent from 2008, the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The company's logo IBM is to change everything, but not its values.
We can expect that to this giant flexible maitrise other crises.

Rychtarova about her husband infidel:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, think again.
Darina rychtarova - 53 years - said it is!
After her husband, Joseph rychtar - 53 years - a bodyguard and amant of Iveta bartosova, 45, Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and return home.
Only it could not wait and set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepa can return to the House, but not as my partner," said rychtarova.
When Darina rychtarova gave asylum to bartosova in his home, it can not be doubted that the couple would not.
When Iveta after 30 days insista to move Ricany, Pepa repoussa not the singer.
And it avoua in public that he loved.
With time Darina has resigned, accepted the link to her husband and has come to say goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer.
If rychtar and bartosova diverge there will be no wife to locate it on the steps of the door of the house.
"It is the biological father of my son and if it wants to end his life in our common home, no one will out."
"It will not be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," has leaked rychtarova showing that she was divorced from her husband, but that they are only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I will remain with Iveta and do not wish."
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect that."
"society continues, I am dealing with repairs, the garden of the house, I buy."
"With Darina discusses completely normal but we do not set down together," said rychtar for blesk.
If rychtarova finds a new love it will not.
"We do not set down together and it does not interest me to know where it is going, with whom and whether it has a link.
I know that this is my fault, I fell in love Iveta and I take full responsibility on me, "said Joseph.
The worst vices of women: this affects you too?
If you ask the people to determine the typical of women, all defects, as each other, are able to lift them out of their hole. "
My dear lady, you know in the following lines of Vice women who come to pump the blood of veines men.
Purchases
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on shopping?
Should you buy at least one dress in a week?
You are simply buying and packages at the time of the balances?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you say, which résisterait lèche-vitrine shops for clothes, to look for oneself fine clothes and then try all cabin - the ideal of different colours?
And for most Women buy is a hobby, it can become a hell for the man.
Remind you just how many times have you said to your spouse that he is awaiting entry...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too big."
"I would need you thin at least 5 kilograms - I should start to make sport?"
"I like you?"
These words do not rappellent-elles you something?
Yes?
You are part of these women who are obsédées by their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop you care of yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still in the process of complaining about his appearance.
Sex plus does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints are rising and more women become empoisonnantes.
The odre and clean in the first place
It is like an endless roundabout.
Washing windows, through the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, dust, strip the bathroom - and that twice a week.
You made remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have sullied the lavabo encrassé the window of the hall of residence, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you suffer precisely this obsession, try to remember that we should not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness must not be in the first place in the family.
This desire but harmless of cleanliness can spoil your family relations and peace.
The work of undermining
"puts the survêtement used in the bin."
"You put these old socks still accounts tomorrow?"
"A towel mouillée has nothing to do with Earth."
If you are on your partner this undermining of the way several times a day, you really break down.
It is clear that you do not think hurt you that everything is fine.
Perhaps if the men did, women do not have to do so undermining...
The Defamation, the persiflage
Defamation, the persiflage but also the insults against someone is also the home of some women.
The women are made especially for relations and are happy to deal with issues such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps all we are missing a small persiflage harmless here and there.
The hand on the core that is a feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent even despise each other and are to their environment - particularly at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.

How have changed the fares since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia 5 travel agencies of State: cedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autotourist.
Travel agents at the time were offering travel in the country of the socialist bloc, because travel in the West were very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled to the holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union, Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea, Bulgaria, Romania - both at the Black Sea - and in Hungary - Balaton.
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a fondness for the West, and travel to the Czech Yugoslavia were very limited for tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist days was that it nétait not allowed for citizens of socialist bloc - also for the Czechoslovak - to travel within the framework of the socialist countries individually.
Czechoslovak if they wanted to travel individually for example in Poland and the Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation or the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agents at the time were also travelling in the West but it was lining up all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" in the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for the currency was the condition for travel to the West was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak was not, however, échangeable currency and it was not possible to obtain money without the agreement of currency - Western currency - to travel to the West.
The Czechs are often holidays in the country where there were so many houses of campaign and chalets as the Czechs were buying and this usually lasts until now.
Travel for Czechs have since seen a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the most, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries across the world.
The great paradox which we did not realise the most popular today is that the country is Croatia when it was not possible to move freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of last century in the neighbouring countries of the West have caused a huge wave of short visits especially in Vienna in Austria and Germany.
Long the Czechoslovak could not travel by plane to the West that everybody wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, Paris travel organisations were sleep the Czechs in tents in parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a journey of Czechs was at that time to secure itself with its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeabilité the Czech crown, which has allowed the tourists finally after decades of Western be free to buy the currency.
Our standard of living and the average salary rose which led around the year another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with by Air Charters, which links with contracts have tremendously reduces costs compared to what it was before.
In the late 1990s of last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries in the world the had later have facilitated our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-révolution, when exotic was prepared the first air charter to a country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as moving every year of direct air charters of Czech tourists in the remote hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
This is more than 100000 exotic Czechs who visit the country each year.
Still an interesting moment in this period, which symbolises our development post-révolution came in 2008.
 On 17 November 2008 the Czech has revoked visas for tourists and has enabled the country to stand completely in the developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history has spent more than half of their holidays abroad - 50, 3% and for the first time in history have spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for holidays abroad including the burdens annexes. kroner per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but it is likely to end with a situation without solution "pat"
Nearly 5mois already Czech football is without a president and there is a risk that Ivan hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a general meeting to take place on Thursday at Nymburk.
But there is still no agreement on what vote we need regulation.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich - rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure has called his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
Only in the era after hasek Football came back to the differences between the chambers of the association that can not agree on a joint candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when he must choose a new president.
Delegates from the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation has been blocked and there was not even about dealing with how to elect.
There has been no agreement on the question of who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials have full powers.
In this single point there was a partial agreement for this moment with the help of office for the state and the law, that the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences continue about the procedure for the election.
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned negotiations or extraordinary, did nothing to the situation
The opinions on the voting possibilitě have changed several times, but the problem remains the same.
The question is: how can the third round to fall into the PAT.
"The bone of contention is that is proceeding according to the statutes or find another model," was one of three vice presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda of professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the candidate expected to win the third round of the model that percentage has received the most votes in the House for which he is a candidate.
The Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw and what is the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes of both Houses.
And the Czech side considers the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only then it would lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely denied the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits that includes the objections of the morave part and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the existing statutes.
- it is surprising that Tomas paclik is also agreement even if he believes that the election rules established on the Statutes most pelta advantage among all the candidates.
"I hope that the vote in all according to the statutes of the association."
"To ensure that there is still no ideas ludicrous provided by a representative as in past general meetings," said the owner of Victoria Plzen which is a candidate for the first time and in its exposed is above all pelta defined.
Pelta remain optimistic.
He Nymburk there will be a new president, and believes that the candidates work together in the future together and constructive manner.
"as possible today in Europe should calm throughout the World Championship."
"Football will be on a wave of happiness and it one more more joy for cooperation" adds Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience of direction of both professional football at regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this Agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czech and Moravian, but there are trends to change the regulations to design."
"That can cause another deadlock in the General Assembly."
"I hope that the sound right wins' rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro, but who can tell if the whole direction of football is full for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which should travel to podgorice among other deputies Dalibor Kucera and rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and we sought a variant for part of the Executive Committee on the ground of reprisals.
At the end of the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The education minister of youth and sport Joseph dobes would be very happy to receive the strongest parts torn in the sports association in the country and encourage them to reach an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state grant, the credibility of the Czech football and also the General Assembly of the Union of Czech sports must determine the direction of the sport after the financial problems of SAZKA.
Paclik goes to battle for the post of President, because he did not see any candidate correct.
If the head of footballers - Plzen Tomas paclik saw before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to what he calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic - afrt - it would not be put into a campaign for this high office.
"If there is such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I do not come to the election."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said paclik the Czech News Agency - ctk.
The motivation of paclik is to compete with Miroslav pelta and Jindrich rajchl to just try to prevent pelta Access at the head of the afrt which in theory would be given favourite for this election.
Paclik also points out that if it remporterait the year he held the post of president only until 2013 elections planned for a General Assembly.
He would see an experienced manager and function at a high level but is not linked with the world of football.
"I spoke with people who have the profile," he said.
"It was terrible for me when some said that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that image," he added.
What bothers, they say, paclik above all is the relationship between pelta and the President of the Union's regional football Plzen controversial novel berbr, man the reputation that is known in the wings as lobbyist capable delegated to influence the vote in the General Assembly.
For paclik it is not acceptable that pelta occupies the position of president.
"If he won, the state would remain and there is nothing new in the football."
"And with the support of berbr, a trader from top flight football, it would be even worse," declared paclik.
This shocking is the fact that the name of pelta was pronounced a couple of years ago in tapping as part of an investigation into a case of corruption, for which pelta has emerged without any trouble.
"I do not know what pelta would bring prestige to football."
"And how would we be treated for UEFA and FIFA," said paclik, who said some time ago, "if pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."
If paclik triompherait to Thursday's vote, it should prove that it could cooperate with felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, feel the same thing.
"It pelta, would be the first with whom I would."
"It has great capabilities
"For example, it would be able to stand as head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association, it would not be able."
"I am not the nose in what I do not know," says paclik in September has attracted a lot of attention when he called for the cancellation of the referees committee with ludek macela replaced Dagmar damkova.
Paclik says it would be to lead the association.
Example he takes her ability to lead of private firms and also runs since last year the club Plzen celebrated with its support in May its triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to provide a certain culture."
"I freinerais for example the influence of some interested groups which tend to influence the disciplinary committee and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste," said paclik does not chache his dislike for the head of Sparta Daniel kretinsky.
It would also be a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power lobby with the policies of high level would get more money for the sport of tax on the Games.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should address."
"If it is the tax on gambling as state political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not present its link with the Plzen club as something negative even if he says that the President of the afrt should be "above the parties."
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It is not ideal."
I see no reason to convey my actions of the club Plzen to someone if I have to come back after a year and a half, "said paclik.
Pelta has promised new Statutes for the afrt should end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one presidential candidate Miroslav pelta has promised that if he is elected, the afrt will have new statutes which should end in the future to squabbles over the rules for the elections.
The official Jablonec is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the succés today to the representation of football should defuse this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September which has not achieved has promised precisely to devote themselves to the national representation and achievement of financial resources, if he is elected.
It has decided to be a candidate at the last moment before the last General Assembly and the delay of two months may allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels are football for a long time and expect that there is a president" Thursday.
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the association," it added, but above all, it is linked with the Jablonec club, has worked a number of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It is also why it has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed in lépoque Ivan hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly in June of statutes have been approved were not perfect as all have noticed."
"If there were not all the various interprétattions we have already had a president since September," highlights pelta.
It is the most important document review of the civic association that has caught the attention of delegates.
"If I go, I take that as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibility if it does not work."
"It is a principle without which we can not exist," said pelta.
Then he tries, they say, not to deal with his opponents.
He said earlier that he can work with Jindrich rajchl he notes in his training in law and that he knows that his adversaire-candidat would be his first vice president.
He did not attack long tonas paclik instead continues to criticise pelta.
"It is in football for a year and has already had some succés."
"However, its attacks were not the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said pelta addressed to his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the statements he made in September.
His strongest weapon is according to his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level until the National réprésentation.
This should be a vitirne of football.
"And I am also efforcerais to complete all the cases that begin with the bohémians or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I entrerais immediate negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for the football," said the Czech News Agency ctk candidate 46ème two months ago.
He also added that his appointment at the head of football does not bring any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he said Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios scheduled with the General Assembly, he believes that The delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we get to Overcome."
"Football needs credibility and it gets his head when there is a new leader optimistic," as stated in pelta two days before the official probably decisive day for his career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the afrt start to work hard
"If the current deputy Jindrich rajchl is elected president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that does not perhaps in large numbers of people, parait-il.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected starts to work hard.
He wants systemic change and make the members of the executive committee are responsible for various areas of football.
He has also promised to settle the matter bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA football, make more money and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan hasek.
"as President I want to play football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful youth football."
"But I am not saying that I will do it only" rajchl said in an interview with ctk.
"I am a team player and would distribute the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member is a certain area."
"And I distribuerai difficult missions for the football against a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy, because we need to begin to work rather than criticise others," he added.
It reported said, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"On me, you know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it is the coup and if I have people behind me that I will keep the obstacles and responsible doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have just said that I must not abandon member because they refuse."
"CEST confidence that I can not betray," he said.
His motivation, they say, is to continue the work began with hasek.
"Over the last two years there has been a lot of work and I do not want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone the end., he said with the fear that in the case of the election by Miroslav pelta the situation within the Union returns as it was before hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and that is something that Mirek pelta do not do."
"behind it are people who fairaient football so that it would only be for those who have been selected."
"You can accuse me a number of things but certainly not to bear quelq' one."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to play football for all because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And it confirms once again that it would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do everything to the Moravia."
"For example, this is the time to consider the second Division is divided into two parts, one Czech and other morave the winners would at first division.
"There would not be a situation like now with only three Moravians team in the division because the problem is currently seeking of young players.
Plzen - as Tomas paclik, president of the club, has entered the competition for the post of president, rajchl can not evaluate its own chances of winning.
"I feel constantly supported by the Czech Chamber which was elected Vice -président and knows that there will be succés with me," said rajchl contemplating among its future contract succés save tens of millions of kroner on contracts with televisions and disadvantageous, negotiations on the Law on the Games.
Instead, he said that the fact that the association is not united is a common mistake.
When he said on pelta "It is disqualifié because with the Czech footblal would lose its credibility," he believes that the second paclik opponent is a strong candidate who has what offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen this year he has done a superb job."
"If he was elected, he would surely in what was started by hasek and would not significantly change among the people in the committees."
"He did not want to spoil his succés' rajchl said évaluait rivals.

Along when Iris meder would travel research during the last 18 months, there is a subject which should not fail in his luggage, wearing swimming costumes.
Expanded on his back in the water, it observa coupoles artistically balancing acts, and nageait against the marbles Putten who waited on the other side of the swimming pool and lacked admire the Art New meticulously restored these swimming pools converted.
If he was like a swimming pool covered, it noted in his book worthy without delay all the details on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been sondées in this way by the historian meder architecture and they have already presented in his book published: "badefreuden - bath joy." the municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic Palace of bath in the Black Forest, "concrete buildings hardcore" in the Taunus.
It brought its "trips to the most exceptional acts of Central Europe" in 13 countries in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German 46 years is a real great bath of culture.
Meder, explains that it does not have much interest in the sport but ell feels drawn to water in a completely different way.
It is galling that fans of swimming should simply see blue carreaux and accommodate the stench of javel water while the joggers inhale the aroma envoûtant forests of épicéa or can listen to the gazouillement happy birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the swimming pools should always be if laides" The viennoise said.
"So I began a collection of fine spilled."
The surface of the water strengthens doubling the architecture
A volatile sauna drowned in a swimming pool and oils - factor in the swimming rooms are huge welfare because all are awake, according to meder.
And if the builders would have given a little more effort, the rooms to swim could be a true délice for us: "instead of a floor has been an area of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand, however, reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optiquement a double way: the voûtes high, carreaux multicoloured springboards.
The volume of image of small badefreuden format is a worthy report 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the historic oasis of welfare - it certainly gives desire to make a leap in the blue.
The collectionneuse remarkable meder found copies during its research in Hungary.
Alongside the spilled welfare splendid as the bath Széchenyi aged 100 in Budapest, it felt natural water containing nitrate in a cave in the Karst - cave in miskolc-tapolca bath - and a bath of Spas which the pools are filled with water containing the alcali and - városi termálfürdö in jászberény and are in a building in the form of bottle.
However, the swimming pools heated in the air in Switzerland and Austria bath offers dramatic views, while a roof in Zurich was the whole city its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg enneigé from a swimming pool outside St. Anton: the Turkish bath is with a window from which one can see the animation on the runway of skiing.
Perhaps the most extraordinary expects the concept of swimming pool swimmers do in längenfeld: the Aqua Dome ötztal resembles a ovni which has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, the steam is open three hills, while in the background are the ötztal mountains to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of javel water does not come from all the collection meder swimming pools.
Many thermal spilled from a smell of sulphur, the árpád-spa in the Hungarian bekescsaba comes a strong smell of oil, it is difficult to believe, to find themselves in a spa health.
The smell comes from the carbon alcalines therapeutic waters containing hydrogen, which is almost black and his Limon skin glue you as soon as you let slip in the swimming pool - a special experience of APS.
During its search along the beautiful swimming pools, Iris meder has also been disappointments: when she wanted to visit ADB free external luhatschowitz, a swimming pool and in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she has been faced with a barricadé ground.
The bath designed by the architèque Dušan jurkovic in 1902 was now closed.
Take a look through the window of the immeuble-art new rouge-blanc-jaune, she was the development of weeds between the carreaux.
She was an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the ADB wildbad Palace of spas.
The building has already survived three phases; you may find not only elements néo-romains released since its inception in 1844 but still a chamber maure Alhambra style that has been added in 1900.
Since its careful modernisation of 1995, the palace spa remains the favourite bath along the expert in swimming pool, Iris meder - and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a good return to melt styles of construction so different in a unit so great," said meder.
With such a palace, plunged into the swimming pool thermale is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank discusses in detail the speculation in raw materials
By teevs
The German Bank abandonne-elle his speculation on the raw materials?
According to information from spiegel-online, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group will then draw conclusions from it.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that banks rely on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent This avenue business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
It is the result of an investigation forsa at the behest of the organisation of foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report by foodwatch in middle of October.
The author Harald Schumann highlights in this article that speculation global stock exchanges on raw materials, pushing prices upward and banks have a complicity in global hunger.
The campaign to protect consumers aligns specifically against the head of the deutsche-bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to act in the same way.
Speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect the market against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts now share the opinion that the parieurs have posted offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently from American competitors criticism: it promised to investigate the accusations and said, "Nothing is worth to play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from the Spiegel online foodwatch-report an International Working Group is currently investigating the accusations.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of Deutsche Bank's board must be presented with recommendation, always.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank says the implications.
This could result in a reduction in the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built its image
The head of foodwatch thilo bode welcomed the news, but at the same time has confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on rising food prices shows a draconian way, how banks today are detrimental to the general interest."
Ackermann is now the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all the investments in its portfolio, for which money has been spent on food speculation" bode said.
"It matters little to Mr Ackermann, if it is starving people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group would present a picture perfect, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank has announced Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change what is planned in the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve its image with a controversial agricultural abandonment of speculation.
And on possible losses, it has not to care, his successor will be of. concern
One in two résilierait placements on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organisation.
Bode published a poll Tuesday, with which the 7 and 8 November the Institute forsa paid out questionnaires to 1001 people.
Just 11 per cent have found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investors who bet on the price of food products are made.
Many customers of the bank would also personal consequences if they learned that their Bank participates in such operations: one on two résilierait, following the poll, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on the raw materials.
43% déconseilleraient such a bank in their environment, 49% said that they réfléchiraient the termination of their bank account to change of establishment.
21st home in Vienna
The flag that has moved
To Ingeborg wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a happy end: the Austrian flag for the global exposure of Brussels in 1958 won a prize, has been a museum in Vienna, was empty, then fell into ruin.
Now it is once again open and took the place of homes of exposure.
If there is enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, its clear forms, its glass sheds, becoming strong and bold and new construction materials that are typical of the belief to the technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Brussels in 1958 Expo is a good and a famous example.
The flag of schwanzer received Once the "great price architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
The construction is seen as an important step to date in the contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, he has also built following the Austrian flag for the Expo.
With its legendary house adjacent to four cylindres BMW and its construction in the form of bowl in Munich, it finally became famous at international level in 1973.
His flag as a temporary construction project was exposed after the Swiss Expo in the garden at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and a museum of the 20th century has opened in 1962 -
But it was not physically and technically suitable for a museum - no walls to accomplish the works of art, not a good environment.
But it was also long used, until the contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and has become increasingly worn out.
Now the architect Adolf krischanitz has transformed the flag, it now bears the name of "house of the 21st century" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
The museum Belvédère opened Tuesday evening, which the House is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view.
The new start has been carried out by Agnès husslein-arco, which has become the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère in 2007.
Husslein-arco, has promoted a historian of art to a significant career between different in his youth patineuse artistic, subsequently sotheby' 's home, the museum Guggenheim and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, it has been particularly to the renovation work on the politicians and the protection of monuments, it has received public funds and private sponsoring and has established the exploitation.
Except the contemporary art, Fritz wotruba sculptor whose works the foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the achievement krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had changed and expanded with the secession of Joseph olbracht sensitivity and that he had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was "an extremely important place where he had seen" exhibitions "virtually every weekend."
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and casual following his trip to Vienna and by his change of use.
In the current changes, there were major problems: the energy structure was "an abyss," said krischanitz.
The profiles of glass windows facades were changed, the glass insulating glass fibre reinforced was raised and the roof replaced by a special security glass.
The thermal poutrelles bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and the floor filled with asbestos were awaited.
Two basement to accommodate the new operation, a display of light tamisé between the house and the road is lighting, a bridge leading to the Entry - it is almost a new construction, but still the slight schwanzer flag.
The external doors have origins, the House is painted as a protection against the colour, rouge-brun.
And the film room is identical to what it was.
And all this under close supervision of authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often the materials that are good and very expensive had to be found, and also like the Office of protection," said krischanitz monuments and it draws attention to a dry soil in a basement.
Despite all the constraints, the problems and the changes, the building was flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the flag, "which stemmed from Brussels," said krischanitz recently, a typical of "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture is always in the wrong place and still wants to "awaken the conscience."
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because there is a stroke of luck for urban construction: Swiss around the garden is precisely the "district of the Central Station all newly planned, with offices and flats.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the support of another krischanitz construction, because the collectionneuse Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Art Center there, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to get a Swiss site in the vicinity of garden.
Winter Bahn anticipates a crime crisis in the millions.
The railway company has produced a plan-crise train, which aims to prevent accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
To combat the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn "will spend here more than 70 million this year.
The "Bild" -zeitung newspaper reported earlier, citing an internal group plan-crise, that investment to a total of around 300 million euros would be provided until 2015.
This should allow greater availability of vehicles and the rail network in the case of extreme weather.
The number of employees for the déneigement rail facilities and the internal and external platforms should among other double and spend roughly 16,000 people.
The goal is to rid the dock of the snow and ice until the start of the phase of service and 90 per cent of appropriate way equipment in service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the head of station Rüdiger grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of trains accidents this winter.
Last winter, the railway company has had a lot of problems for the transport users, because it is among other reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
That is how many new regional trains for years have authorisation from the Ministry of railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years to do, given that IT MUST CHECK the axles of ICE trains more frequently to the workshop, after a break of axles took place on ice in the Central Station in Cologne.
The German Bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is new to us: the German Bank Deutsche Bank 'must pay a fine running into millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, this giant of the sector's past the grabs more in America: the Institute of Frankfurt pays in comparison, 106 million euros, $145 million to settle a dispute because of the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of the financial markets ncua door to big banks a series of accusations, and to encourage the cooperative banks to making false promises about the purchase of financial products; they have underestimated the risks.
They have lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led to the banks to the bottom.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution for this, but the parties are a case in court," said a spokesperson of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank has not recognised in comparison fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of a sum of $20.5 million.
The President of ncua Debbie matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration, ncua us responsible for cooperative banks and it intervenes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The ncua tries to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
Comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other big banks to part and summer has brought before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
On the issue of mortgage documents it is "mortgage-backed securities."
The houses of credit are the basis.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, This bank has proved fatal for a large number of companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the present time it breath on American banks a wind storm.
And supervisors have brought many investors use to obtain compensation or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency - fhfa triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It criticises 18 major international banks, the two American housing financial state Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to benefit in kind in affairs of mortgages of about 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank will also appeal to the fhfa, there are several operations to a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
Supervisors call, the Frankfurter responded "substantial losses," but without naming a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unjustified and says it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion for IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, it invests tremendously in the company of IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares with a value of more than $10 billion.
Once the big American investor Warren Buffett is constantly do not invest in companies computer company, given that developments in the long term it would not emerge that poor prognosis.
But he has read the reports of IBM and has changed his opinion on the investment in the sector.
He had already understand much earlier that IBM is especially services and computer systems for the sectors it to other companies.
An investment from Warren Buffett is seen as an attack of Knight in the world of finance.
It therefore activity now IBM gives itself the right to be called "Mr. IBM."
Because economic Buffett revealed today issuing CNBC, he has bought since March of IBM shares with a value of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway IBM has thus become a major shareholder with a 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM has never knew of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the direction, which even during the economic crisis was assured a reasonable profit.
"You have done a fantastic job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM set for some time on the lucrative it as "holding centers accounting services.
The pioneer of computers, more than 100 years old, offers software and consulting as well as calculating works very well.
Buffett rather had so far avoided the technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies which he understands the business.
But rather Buffett tackles the rail frêt, or do something about lubricants manufacturers of machines.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of large groups such as coke or Munich Re, Munich, the former rück.
This octogénaire 81 years took in the 1960s "the small company Berkshire Hathaway textile and had built into one of the world's most prestigious companies, with smart investments.
However his style of life is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
Meaning almost infallible for money Omaha won him the nickname of "oracle."
Following the announcement of the investment Buffett what IBM rose by one percent on the stock market.
"Big Blue," as is IBM, has a stock market value of a total of more than $220 billion and account with Apple and Microsoft among the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, it does not participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the zwickauer cell 'German the Turkish media have doubts about the rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which renaîtrait now.
The killing of eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek company in 2000 to 2006 had a background of extremism.
Following this news, Turkey and the population germano-turque reacts with fear and anxiety.
Because for many germano-turcs spectrum long thought dead back his appearance: since the attacks mölln inflammatory in November 1992 and solingen in May 1993, there was no longer any comparable with This right wing extremist violence against the Turks.
There was a xenophobia in Germany, it has ever been.
However, the right wing extremist network, which has been detected reveals the scale of the scale is far from predictable.
"is a return to the ideology of bloody," "That was the title of the haberturk Turkish newspaper's publication on the Internet.
But the newspaper Sabah highlights that one of the perpetrators would have been a v-homme of the protection of the constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of the extreme right.
It is reasoned that was the Turkish community in Germany: has called this weekend in a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German political and Turks had thought to a ceremony germano-turc recruitment of the 50th anniversary of the agreement.
It is with gaies colours that cohabitation was staging, symbolizing a history of success.
Some Turkish media reports are the result of a blow: "Germany's gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the turque- platform "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
As the German publication of "hürriyet" DO NOT deny to draw clear conditions.
"It starts to puer" is the title of the Chronicle of Ahmet külahci.
It stresses that people have been killed, have paid taxes and would have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Police action has been seen very critically on the germano-turcs forums and they had discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities suspect to make searches in some quarters of extreme right, finds the perpetrators.
More than one is prepared at least to rhetorical or drastic means: "if the case continues to be rushed, it will remain to nothing other than the migrants themselves and arms."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," wrote, "selen."
What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of mölln and solingen in the 1990s have illustrated.
The photograph of the ruins after the fire in German and Turkish solingen is deeply rooted in the memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly the Turks living here that there is a credible threat, and the Germans, on which the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have aiguisé a sense of the US in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Once it is the failure of the German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complaint: Helmut Kohl has refused to visit the survivors of mölln.
After the fire solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the leader of the Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how local taxes was the Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of their tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once more how many germano-turcs is deep mistrust of the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of further clarification and revaluation of terrorism of the extreme right in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The Bank more expansionist Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has claimed almost collapse in the financial crisis and patina Meanwhile from one crisis to another.
This is a German who must move now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was seen in July, 2013, a post he was almost as spectacular, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, has welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its strong recently introduced and passed kind comments on the future colleagues.
"UBS has passed the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."
And yet, from the September it was clear that everything will change.
A merchant of UBS Securities in London diverted all the bank's security systems and had soared approximately 1.7 billion.
The head of the Board of the UBS Oswald grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.
The President of the Board of UBS has seen since with - and all asking: when Axel Weber does finally?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the Bank from February 2012.
And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
It is not a banker, much more economy professor and chairman of the bank, and it would have needed a period of adjustment.
In one fell swoop it bears the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."
Indeed, the UBS is a huge hand - Until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it patina for years a scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saving the Swiss bank so proud.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the asset manager Switzerland, silent and sound, but also crafty, was combined with ambitious targets: it also wanted to become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.
Therefore the UBS has a hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, had advanced as Investment Bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
This has been feeling.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of for many years in Zurich bank says: "I have always taken the bank UBS as a model of good with my students."
"In the current approach, we wonder: How do I could simply be wrong at this point?"
It is deeply wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent that something was not right for the first time at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was once seen as a top banker and a great intellectual.
A few months later it was considered for why he was gone.
The division of the bank had soared with sub-prime documents and has had to write off billions.
To support this, the UBS has announced a capital increase worth 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For that she has indeed found investors, but that might shortly before froncé frown: an Asian background of State non-transparent from Singapore and bottom of Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it has never even heard his name.
This was the first blast.
In April 2008 it has worsened.
The Bank was expected to announce new losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel ospel who was still the second Board in 2006 the best paid in Switzerland, were sacked.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank has bought the UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become copropriétaire of the bank.
Throughout Switzerland has been shaken - because she has noted how this could be disastrous for a small country, of harboring such large banks.
Finally, the assessment of UBS's total 2007 are éleva at more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland - see graph.
"We could not save the UBS once again," said the researcher from banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster this was followed by the second.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and has declared itself ready to publish the data from the wealthy clientele, which had been fraud tax perhaps with the help of the bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million in higher reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine.
The UBS has more or less published it had helped to tax fraud.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the head of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
The bank had lost credibility in a few months in the two main areas of business: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of the support for tax evasion.
And, as he was somewhat a return to calm, and as it did, that UBS would manage, he followed in this unfortunate history of merchants of title: one merchant title increased 1.7 billion, before the bank will have no choice but to admit that something was not right.
And being published: with the risk management by Investment Bank that still does not seem to work.
"with the case adoboli, it was clear that the risk control to too little changed," said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
As the financial director of a large German bank is safe: "The UBS's problem is that it does not control risks in hand.
However it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss Bankers had long taken their function, that to become a guardian of the world's great fortune: not too big, but the security risks for the money - and the world could well fall beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt and sprüngli are at a particularly noble chocolate.
The heart of the UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the sound cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is just a little more.
Now the situation is a classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in the central station in Zurich, which led directly to the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the summits enneigés Swiss mountains.
The prestigious buildings are here, the rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
The bijoutiers as tiffany' s, we find them here between the Swiss traditions as well as those of the confectionery sprüngli stores.
Swiss bankers have been here for centuries: the Swiss National Bank through the palace of credit to elitist private banks as Julius bär.
You arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are in stone, which are épaisses leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the bank, a major label for "safe."
The UBS knows what the customer research here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day out of the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and credit, Switzerland, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank found.
It ultimately would prefer not to read his name in the paper, like all the Swiss Bankers IT Business with the two big banks.
The UBS became too great, trouve-t' it - especially in investment banking, where the Saxon would be widespread.
The Swiss no longer have anything to say.
"And even though they have long been adapted to the habits of the Saxon."
This was indeed the Members that has changed the investment bank UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime LIKE THE GREAT Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On Wednesday the coalition government of small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," the author Lukas hässig wrote in his book "The crash of the UBS."
With up to 68 billion francs around, or 45 billion, the politicians have agreed to save of the large bank failure.
How is this pouvait-il happen?
If we are talking with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group.
A bank has been created, which was already too big to little Switzerland - and was constantly increasing.
Which has helped, is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargy bank with strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already strong International.
Suddenly, the international investment banks have been much access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of the UBS, and Marcel ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I have always thought that wuffli and ospel constituted a dream team," said the researcher from banks, Hans Geiger.
"wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which is very well in models and statistics, and ospel, intuitif, who has fought her way to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But ospel would have trust until the end wuffli.
And wuffli probably committed at the end of a crucial mistake: "He thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly the rallies in which the leader of the group leaders wuffli said always the same slogan: détrôner Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the world's most powerful Investment Bank.
It has ordered the "league tables" rankings, which have documented at the time the success of banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to climb to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded.

The smart corneilles spread in cities
In many places, freux are regarded as "problem of no birds' very intelligent, but experts say that these animals are no longer chasing cities for a long time.
Some love them, some of them want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. corneilles belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the birds' no problem 'is not yet in sight.
In the first ostfriesisch Symposium on the corneilles, experts have said that it is no longer possible to expel the freux towns.
Experts from Germany discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities on the exodus of freux especially protected: the use of chemicals in agriculture to destroy more traditional vital spaces.
The hunt, the organisation and the felling of trees couvaison typical made life difficult for birds.
The corneilles are under the protection of the environment.
There are large settlements with more than 600 couvaison couples in the westfälischen soest, in the northwest including jever, diepholz and Achim near Bremen and LEER.

Critics have found the capture and killing of birds in traps with clubs particularly brutal.
"The expulsion order, the exclusion, serves no purpose," said the planificateur of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner klöver.
The destruction of nests with water under pressure or cutting down trees, often produces unintended consequences, said the environment expert Manfred Kaiser Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are moving, the large settlements fall and they would disperse in other places."
The exclusion is possible only in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can not be exterminated."
The problem is not resolved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner LEER.
Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a aversif conditioning and accrocheuses offers, to enable them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, UTA Maria jürgens prospectait signs of info on behalf of chainsaws completely different "to establish relations with:" We finally to cope with a button in the face with a dose of confidence. "
Jürgens has co-fondé ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif baskets in Schleswig-Holstein road signs informing on the lives of these freux highly intelligent.
It has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critical of the noise caused by the birds: "This is a large number of communication, these oiseaux-là have much to say."
Intelligence and cunning of animals are legendary: the freux do not use only instruments it is working to reach a beauty but they produce their own tools as instruments of work.
Of the University of Cambridge éthologistes testing four freux recently, how is the intelligence of the birds.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they should be down scaffolding with stones to come to a larva.
With little training, they recognize déterminément a stone should have some grosseur and form to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the corneilles trapu astute was then to solve a problem.
In a cylindre placed vertically, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not achieve their booty with their spat.
However, the researchers had set pieces of iron over at their disposal.
All four animals make a crochet with which they could catch the small bucket of small tuyau.
Three of the four freux we succeed even from the beginning.

The mass slaughter staff
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. "the beauty and the sorrow: intimate year history of the First World War" - the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War, it starts with a long list of characters you greenhouse heart.
A council to begin: tear up carefully this page and do your marque-page.
You know about these people in detail, but in this narrative romantic Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in these few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disrupted and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Extraordinary he wrote a book he describes, accurately, as "a book of anti-histoire."
It contains a few known, the relevant treaties or battles names; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on the strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, accounts, a paper describing what it could be. "it contains the feelings and impressions, experiences and moods.
"The beauty and the sorrow" summarises the experiences in War 20 ordinary men and women more or less, on both sides of the war, young schoolchildren and botanistes escaladeurs, from doctors, ambulanciers and sellers.
Some become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, and some lose members, will become insane or will lose their lives.
Their lives wavering here as the cierges a church: while some becoming extinct, we rallume new ones.
Traditional the book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.
It provides a corrective to the idea that the First World War is only by the terrible war in the trenches on the Western Front.
"The beauty and the sorrow" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and eastern Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under the hives; one is Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tsé-tsé are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina which pue cordite.
When gun barrel roar away, and that you are a mother at home, are you staying or fuyez-vous?
Which will anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or the reasons for the war.
According to Peter Englund, the lack of facts was amplified by the assumptions of the hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours. "
"The beauty and the sorrow" follows those such as Florence farmborough, an English nourrice in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small, isolated moments and details.
Most tackle deprivation and the ability to cope.
By sharing the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "substitute, ersatz everywhere."
'replacement, forged aluminum coffee, rubber, paper bandages imitation, wooden buttons. "
It continues on the food of replacement in Germany.
It describes the "meat made rice cooked sheep crushed in fat - and ended with a fake wood bones; tobacco made with dry skin and dried roots of potatoes; wooden soles of shoes."
He says that "Permitted 837 alternative meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also alternative 511 cafes."
Some stories address the honour and courage.
An American acknowledges its own pulsion to savagery and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, is what the men were targeted, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that this means veneer of civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay any attention.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice themselves, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, this is rather like "a condemned man struggling in secret."
Other Comments About the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the factories."
It captures the arrival of what he called "a new species in the bestiaire at the beginning of the century: a mass murderer well articulated and convinced ideologically, carved up clothes, which executes its slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People act unexpectedly; there are so many basic behavior of heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who tried to catch a disease at any price vénérienne from prostitutes to avoid the service at the front.
"is the most grotesque expression in the trade of more due to the gonorrhée, that the soldiers buy and range on the genital organs in the hope of finally to hospital," he writes.
"Desperate to apply it on the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this translation of the Swede Peter Englund by Peter serious, the prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, it captures the way the war has caused "uncontrollable forces exclusively: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are starting to ask why their leaders are in a war.
The best books on the First World War are often indirect, such as' Great War and Modern Memory "- the Great War and modern memory of Paul Fussel, or" Western anything new, "Erich Maria remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is a conventional pantheon little.
The end of the book is the most devastating that I have read in a non-fictionnelle work.
I do not will reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized on your hands this page, which contains the list of people and scorched with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation

The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen as the zuccotti park would be emptier.
The operation has remained secret all except for some senior officers as well as other information from the start that they would be an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, its presence underlining the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
He could not be any repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of poivre gas against demonstrators, which went against the rules of the department and have created a storm of public sympathy for the protesters.
The operation to clean the park zuccotti its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of training and planning.
The police had prepared with the conduct of business in other cities.
A crucial year was held on the island of Randall to the operation in zuccotti park.
The police officers receive better training against the riots - counterterrorism measures aimed at moving rapidly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move within the park have been at the very last minute, "said one accustomed, referring to the operation as" a simple exercise. "
"The few that I know and were called police did not know that they would zuccotti park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only that they make are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city has been able to learn a lesson, where the secrecy of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean the park but has been postponed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various units, including all the neighborhood's operational forces - Dozens of officers used to neighborhoods particularly criminals.
Mr Kelly said that many people came and went in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a propitious time.
"needs to do when the park was the least of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with loudspeakers spots and gathered on pipe slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The light and resounding recorded messages from loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While the business community pénétraient officers in the park with their coupe-vent light blue, many demonstrators have simply put their affairs and went.
No attempt has been hit before 1h45 said the police, which has left the occupants of the time to gather their affairs.
Other policemen have been know teams on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the Park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the police department's chief spokesman, said that this had been taken solely by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented from seeing the speech inside the Park, severely held by the officers.
Mr Browne said that trucks of television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police was to the West through the thick jumble of cases of demonstrators, including plastic luggage, the lawn and the leaf bags full of clothes, the Department of Sanitation teams followed, nettoyant all occupants they left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet soon after.
The largest group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp were stuck together.
Finally, two people were enchaînées trees, said Mr Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the cadenas.
No arrest has taken place in the park before 3h30 said Mr Kelly.
According to the police, the cleansing operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr Browne, nearly 142 people have been arrested in the park.
Most for "disruption of public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most departing commander officer to be found at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's Chief of Detectives, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although now, "was not the operations," said Mr Browne.
A second group of police officers patientaient along the eastern side of the park, between liberty Street and Cedar Street intervention, if necessary.
Barricades have been put on Cortlandt Street, a pâté homes north of the park, and Pine Street, in the south.
It was the police extend far beyond the perimeter zuccotti park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people to drive.
Some 28 people were on the north side.
One of the strongest of the night activities took place south of the park.
To 5h00, south of Pine Street, a demonstrator drove into the police not successful in a car and others have been found in the process to clear the tyres of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of contreplaqué came by stealing the crowds.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalised.
The Union of school aid continues the city for layoffs
The Union, which represents hundreds of school who lost their jobs last month provides aid to take unnecessary Wednesday a trial in the city for redundancies and discriminatory, a disproportionate impact on schools that receive disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the Union, 37e district council, to try to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred 72 aid coordinators of parents and other school employees, as part of the lowest wages in the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October, union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political campaign for not having left the city into a fund for health care, led by groups of workers, and that would have helped to close the budget gap in the spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing of the city Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget concluded in June.
A member of the Council hit back with school aid, stating that the redundancies were not specified in the budget.
The Council's 37e district officers have said that they rempliraient advice to appeal, saying the Department of Education, it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis Mr Walcott and the Department of Education of the city will be the defence and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight workers made redundant, all black or school of Latin American origin, as most of the aid that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen the reasons of the trial and therefore can not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft obtained by the New York Times, the Union miserait complaints about the number of redundancies in the schools of the poorest districts of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most funding because of a regular underfunded.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and some just in Upper East Side school or Tribeca, 17 aid schools have lost their jobs in the twenty-third Brownsville district, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the South Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of school children live in poverty, the prosecution claim that "this is not an area of affluent parents who can bring budget funds to fill the gaps."
The public school 36 budget has been reduced by 3,26% this year, and funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each entry is disadvantaged.
The Union also says that the directors of colleges have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo employed the term "overshoot" to describe the action, even if "overshoot" more generally described the action to move a teacher in a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft of complaints, "66 coordinators of parents have been dismissed," and "not only because of excess."
Completed mission: Congress reaches an agreement on the issue of Libya
Ultimately, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took an uprising succeeded, long the capture and death of dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry, Democrat - massachussetts, with Senators John McCain, Republican - Arizona and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent - Connecticut, welcoming the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans when they begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, and with the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of military forces in Libya.
The genuine bipartisan Bill was defeated by a wide margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Representatives has also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of American operations in Libya.
The US mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory - The legislative Congress even annoyed enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from under the feet.
The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli has fallen below the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission has officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "extraordinary congratulate the Libyan people for their courage and determination in order to freedom" and "Congratulate the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism that is fantastic."
The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measure remportera-t-elle all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee or divisera-t-elle legislators like last June?
The senator and president of the independent commission Richard D. Lugar - opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
In the capitol, the House will vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob goodlatte, Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without having tried.
The amendment of goodlatte is part of 68 Constitutional amendments have been presented to Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are frequent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations on a precedent.
There are at least 15 in the House only versions of the amendment to a balanced budget, and another handful who are said to control federal spending.
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want sweetening their CV - the chance to claim to be the author of such a measure.
The Law on control of the budget - Budget Control Act approved in August called the House and the Senate's vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators soft we voted in favour of a resolution endorsing the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several Members want to limit the number of mandates in which members of Congress can be used, while José E. Serrano - Democrat - NEW YORK - want to lift the limit of two terms for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. - - Illinois Democrat - has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.
A proposed amendment banning marriage between people of the same sex is constantly, as the amendment banning the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed.
So eager were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111e Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110e.
The pace slows in the early 1990s, when the members offered more than 150 amendments generally every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they did not have much more successful than they are today.
The last to have been added - the 27th amendment, was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"massacred but not beaten," says Gabrielle giffords during his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman has shot above through relating to Tucson, the representative Gabrielle giffords - - Arizona Democrat - appeared in a television programme on Monday evening, sang "The sun will come out tomorrow" to Broadway and said above all recover rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance on "20/20" on the television channel ABC newspaper, along with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle giffords fought into phrases and needed help to walk.
The programme made his return difficult following the ball which has divided his scalp and bottomless pit the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, it had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle giffords smiled, amusement and sang - and called his recovery "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer was asked how it felt, Gabrielle giffords, 41 years, responded pretty well. "
The meeting with Gabrielle giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was held at an hour of a special edition of "20/20," reported the eve of the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
The issue has traced the restoration of Gabrielle special giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In video footage by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, we see on his hospital bed, his head razed and a large scar on the front.
It is to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to execute simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, her first word: "what."
A few days later, Gabrielle giffords has chuchoté another word 'toast' to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle giffords: we see the representative currently sing with doctors seem to Cyndi Lauper "or girls wanna have fun" and Tom Petty free fallin? '. "
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle giffords, which is two hours each day with the doctors, has said that he does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, it was about to read an article about the shooting of 12 March when it has stopped and asked for the first time, sharing information on the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee loughner, is detained in a prison in the Missouri and vigorously Treaty pending the trial.
"There has been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle giffords Diane Sawyer.
"tough, tough, tough."
During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you have not been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And that turns out, you recover and come back stronger than ever.
More Please respect for troops
The event: a gala to Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for veterans without household in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd costume-cravate is standing on its feet for the hail.
"The military, men and women are seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, organiser of the collection of funds in the spring.
A military haut-gradé present at the gala, attended the Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the United States, has seen the role of troops in a different way.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," The military haut-gradé wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it was not respect. Just the pity.
The contradictory impressions to illustrate the difficult relations which have been established between the military and a passionate American public but often distant.
The praise lavished the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all the victims' said the Brigadier-General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and go soon for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way we support is to lock ourselves in the role of unfortunate souls."
This is a very sensitive issue for the military rulers, who do not want to seem not grateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realise that the anger of revenantes troops from the Vietnam War was much worse.
As well, most of the conversations on the nails are confidence among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons in the battle with the Marine Colonel mark Cancian pensioner has warned that the public decide their service from two perspectives.
Some people would watch with respect, since they have been faced with insurgents and have travelled to distant lands.
Others ask if a veteran angry and violent "lies beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the government in Washington.
When he sought a job, he said, he felt that some people who were putting the interviews were so subtle him if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after her return from battle.
"When you raise the subject of service, you have negative impressions," recalls the Colonel Cancian when he speaks of his son.
The difficulties of military arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
The victories are rarely acknowledged in a country more familiar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer valorisons heroism in the same way as in the Second World War," said Lt. Gen. David barno pensioner, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the military focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a people.
Troops are recognized for the number of services endured periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injury.
The army against the growing pressure of punishing rapists
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for an alleged inaction on rape.
The case, hundreds of plaintiffs prepare the next.
The soldier from 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. returning to their barracks Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dîné with a friend, when she visited a colleague with a pack of beers.
He was asked if he could join his house for a drink.
"It was a warning signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas the has set aside runs its concern.
I thought: no, he was 19 years old.
"It is of Texas' Commission.
"I have had to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entered the house of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind prétend-elle, thrown on the ground and raped.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others do not, will wait anxiously the historic court ruling at a trial that will take place in Arlington, in Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial brought against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape in the military, undercutting the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial was initially 17 complainants, and this number has risen to 28 months following - 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers; they also claim that the army was not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says targeting the military galonnées, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure" she.
"People are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also says that since February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future prosecution.
His strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all your eggs in one basket - it pursue several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil macbride has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
Legal documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the disbursement of the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army can not be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries in the armed forces.
According to a Supreme Court decision in 1950, called the feres doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by the staff active.
"Alleged evil is inherent in the military service of plaintiffs' show the documents.
The Defense Department has refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While officially, women still do not have the right to go to battle, this distinction is included on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only men.
Women in Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers play an increasingly important role, particularly for contact with local women.
Result: on the two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two thirds in a state of war.
It is time for the army to modernise says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this battle: three other trials are underway in most of its members.
At Yale Law School, the centre of Legal Services veterans is preparing a case against the four main Military Academies for allegedly encouraging an atmosphere misogynist.
On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a case against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" awarded to rape victims to give them leave - relatively normal, according to the activists such as Anu bhagwaru Service Women's Action Network, military action network of women, a group for human rights.
His group has brought a lawsuit in December to the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of applications for benefits for those claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of Senators and Representatives, with different solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded from the centre of Intervention and Prevention of sexual assault, sexual assault prevention and response office from the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is underestimated, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, the figure is approximately 13.5% of 19,000 incidents this year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecution: in 2010, 20% of the cases in the army have been the subject of a civilian trial - half the percentage of the judicial system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman it informs the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the event.
That night, she asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape to various police, doctors and commanders.
It has undergone a "rape kit" - literally a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut on his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge in a trial in which it asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend before the day of his aggression.
Six people have shown as witnesses of morality and the author of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I had to start having contractions. I have started to cry after the court."
"I have been placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I am out, I remember saying to my master" that was not his trial but mine. "
Elizabeth military Lyman was forced to see a psychiatrist, who came to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit to serve.
In January 2010, has been put under the terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving advantage.
Whether the case Lyman and other complainants progress or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, law professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, it said, "In my view, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticised the feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by the responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try," it added.
These things change only when the good guys are willing to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, includes its hundreds of other plaintiffs to trial.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she says.
Where until we mourrions, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders breivik Behring was just a guy anti-immigration expressing their views online.
Monday, breivik, who has admitted having been taken to a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, has faced its first trial.
When breivik acted alone, it was far from being on the cyberspace: he had spent a lot of time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can find them?
Easy... connectez-vous Facebook.
"We realised that it was not so difficult that at home," says Jamie Bartlett, main author of a recently published report by the Reflection Group demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett advertising, that researchers could simply use the tool of the site to find the people they are seeking with scientific precision - how the mercaticiens do for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe, it has targeted with announcements, but instead to link them to a new group or product announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry and the questions related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
When they come into contact with them through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask 10,000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some are not at all surprising results: the right wing groups are more online supporters of men, Young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, those who associate online activism and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen. "
The study of demos is just one example of how Facebook has become the key new tool in the hands of scientists.
Tanks, medical researchers and analysts use the site to assess all the issues that affect the health issues as Social Trends, thanks to "I love," Publications on the walls and updated statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, the supernova data creates an explosion in research, increasing the amount of research that the site's name appears in the form of nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not move in the streets.
"Before, when you are attempting to carry out investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You go to the party, but they do you would never have allowed to," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the social and health problems.
According to a recent study of the University of Wisconsin-Madison D. Megan Moreno, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits with alcohol in their blood were much more likely to be alcoholics that students discreet.
Megan Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and perhaps intervene to help a student whose status speaks often of alcohol.
"You ca n't address a problem if you do not diagnostiquez," Dimitri Christakis, an author of Megan Moreno and Director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Research Institute for children is located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify the children at risk, and in another case would not be recognised."
Facebook also constantly access information of its users.
The team from the site that deals with data has studied the statistics on the love and the day of the saint by rivals Valentin situation, the rate of participation in the upcoming elections in 2010 and a National Happiness Index - Thanks to information only available digital - the champions of freedom have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes.
But Facebook users know that the site is that their liking or not - in power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed access to your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they have not heard?
While the researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information via the Internet, other than it is anything else online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought that a researcher can consider their profile," said Neil Selwyn sociologist knowledge laboratory in London, according to a study in 2006 that he conducted with the Facebook walls of her students.
"As far as they know, exchanges were seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth or on the wall of a user profile.
"What you say on Facebook and what you are doing it are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn believe a technological bloc-notes and a pen are the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with the people," he states.
"Social Studies are meant to address the social aspect - and the social, not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders breivik Behring
Anders breivik Behring, the man who admitted having organised the two attacks which have been 77 deaths in Norway this summer, is described as a "Resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial taking place in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and templiers audience of Norway," accounts in a room full of 500 people.
"Regarding the competence of the Court, I reject it, because you want your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I am not guilty."
The judge torkjel breivik nesheim interrupted during this monologue because it "did not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express their views."
For the same reason, it has refused to breivik, who has brought with it a speech on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge nesheim has also asked the police to keep breivik in custody 12 more weeks, he was forbidden to speak to the media for four weeks and has warned that the authorities surveilleraient very closely all the visits and connections for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of victims were present at the hearing.
Some breivik came hoping to look in the eyes, others to be sure that it will be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"It was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of the Norwegian television channel NRK utoya.
"I was not comfortable, but I personally have a bit further having seen and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, breivik has remained calm and professional throughout the trial he saw the journalists and the survivors in the eye in entering and leaving the court.
Despite the bizarre idea that breivik belongs to a broad movement of "resistance," the Judge determined that he was not crazy. He also said that there is no evidence he did with accomplices.
The 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which réconfortera perhaps some.
But this does not reduce the pain or the confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I have preferred that he looks like a monster, but that is not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
Lost 7 from the interview of Steve Jobs, the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - distinguishing itself by the technical engineering and inventor of the modern computer.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs back recently and which will be published this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit understood the process and work flow of products.
It was no doubt a Creator and a dreamer. He identified a hippie but was also very meticulous and organised, and a améliorateur charts - a man who believed that many managers were suffering a "disease leaving think a clever idea is 90% of the work...... but a lot of manual work between a clever idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob cringely develops the television series "triumph of the nerds." This series runs through the birth of the computer, and it sits for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
This time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave apple. it was already hard on his new computer company next to a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with cringely is used in nerds, he says that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs as a comprehensive video is found in the garage of the filmmaker.
This video, slightly resurgence is the basis of the film on 68 minutes, Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, which will be distributed to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to detest the detailed discussions, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technology and business strategies.
And incredibly carefully.
At four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, when Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.
We discover also moments when the perfectionnisme of Steve Jobs ressurgit, where it seems anxious to hear the issues of cringely, giving him little shoulder to speed up and take or issues of major importance.
Filmed before the age of pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on lost interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it considers good or bad for the other companies and has made its own view on the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumes assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and based on the rights that we see here, the Dreamer anxious on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
It is then put on them.
For a quick summary of seven outstanding sequences of lost interview:
On the way he has learned to manage a company:
"during all these years, I have always asked: why are you doing it?" and the answers are always the same: "Oh, simply because we need to make them."
No one knows why, no one is in depth of things in a company.
This is what I have discovered.
Steve Jobs is giving details of its efforts to simplify accounting for apple.
Baffled as to how the costs were recorded - often begins with a "standard" estimated to cost to nose, then adjusted with a variation - it has developed an automated factory which ensures the precise calculation of trading costs.
On the opportunity to play a round the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the blue box that he has created with Steve Wozniak - a device which helped to PIRATER telephone networks and telephone longue-distance free of charge.
The device has been the subject of numerous written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the blue box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak have tested using a public telephone box, and an appeal can be connectant a network AT & T to another while circumventing satellites as much as possible.
"We enveloppions crystal different things and you hurliez half a dozen times in the public telephone and that you came a minute later in public telephone in hand," explains riant jobs.
"We were young and with this blue box ourselves, we have learned that we could create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
We both did not know much, but we have been able to invent a small thing capable of controlling things; it was an incredible lesson one day, and I do not believe that Apple would have existed without it.
Steve Jobs is by sharing a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the blue box in the middle of the night in masquerading as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are mad laugh just before the pope himself is awakened.
On his love with the technology - and doorstep selling of Bill Hewlett:
The age of 12 years ago, the hunt for spare parts to build a fréquencemètre, is seeking the number of Bill Hewlett in the book and it requires a phone call.
Shortly after their conversation in 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a summer job part time at Hewlett-Packard.
"It has had a tremendous influence on me, it was the only company that I had seen at this age and it has formed my definition of a company, and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories in the company, based in Palo Alto, where he found the "first office computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small tube cathodique. I am falling in love.
The teenager that I was has returned from HP and began to write programmes for this machine.
On improvisation innovation:
Has several times in the interview, Steve Jobs is to invent new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, when he is to sell a few cards printed circuits, a customer asked to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he dût address the Assembly and finished the delivery of aircraft.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember Many disputes... I am criait above, arguing that it would take five years... to manufacture a mouse that cost $300. I have had enough, I am out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we can produce for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
On the essoufflent big business:
Well before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial leaders were wrong and losing control of their market share.
"recognise that you work for IBM or Xerox, you better copier and printer, and after?"
So you have the monopoly of the market, the company does not have more success.
Sales and Marketing can change, so... they are the types of people who end up leading companies and officials in product are sidelined for decisions.
The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can not imagine design a good product for a bad product - the manual work required.
That is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could hold the computer industry.
It could have been 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have scored the defeat to victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
"A huge part of manual work between a clever idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and growing."
You learn a lot on its intricacies.
Any compromise... there are some things you can not do, électrons can, glass, incredibly, factories.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind, these concepts it by assembling it to each other.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. it is trying to explain to the best products that men have created, and try to make these things that you create product.
Picasso once said that good artists copy, AND THAT GREAT artists fly.
We have always ashamed to fly with excellent ideas.
That is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional: the people who worked on were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, who are simply proved the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they have done an excellent job in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dînent with opponents of the law while the Court meets health
The day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political disagreement about whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case to the High Court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges are gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases in question was a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at national level.
The justices agreed to hear the complaint, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at a time when the Tribunal's decision will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argumentera on the rejection of the law, will probably be Paul Clement, who has served as a general solliciteur us during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of soft, pllc Bancroft, was part of two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society, Federalist Society, a conservative legal group dedicated to defend the principles for a long time.
Another cabinet which has sponsored the dinner, Jones day, represents one of the trade associations who have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, National Federation of Independent Business.
Another developer has been the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the case.
Was, among other things, Mitch McConnell there declared, top Senate Republican and opponent of the health law.
Hot the guests for dinner? scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the federalist society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of conduct.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4C, which reads: "A judge can attend collections of funds related to the right and other organizations that the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the programme of such an event."
However, the mere presence of scalia and Thomas close to two law firms of the case, and a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court upholds the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of common cause.
"The judges buvaient and dînaient and a collection of Gala fund with lawyers with cases pending before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds from this event to dismantle any complaint of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily cases to the court with the agenda of groups such as the federalist society.
And the wife of Thomas, ginni, is a conservative activist haut-profil.
Moreover, the conservatives argue that the judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solliciteur general in the Obama administration when the first opposition to the bill has been referred to the Court of First Instance.
His critics have lobbied for Kagan to object to hear the case, saying it was too invested in defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that it would.
Boeing has a record of $18 billion order for planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, planes bi-couloirs, with an option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than one billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary for a company receives an order looking 50 of its products.
It is in fact a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and that the total amount of these 50 had reached the record of 18 billion dollars.
Equally astonishing is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, growing a gold mine of future aircraft orders.
Chicago in forecasts published Monday, the company believes that the Middle East Airlines will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 had a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing has informed the commissioning of the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who has spent this requires huge undertaking.
Boeing announced in Dubai aviation exhibition of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which show the total amount of the Order to 26 billion dollars.
On the other hand, Oman Air Boeing said Monday that the company has ordered six Boeing 787-8, dubbed dreamliners, a model which flatters significant fuel savings and commodités for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft amounts to more than a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal dihora, analyst morningstar.
"These clients in particular have a huge value."
In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have a lot of their airlines.
They not only have the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it is their most important costs - they will not so damaging as the country win money with the rise of oil prices.
This is important because these companies are less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the price of oil rises, said dihora.
"They have a natural coverage of risk," he said.
The order Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing aircraft gros-porteurs market and help to curb the attempted encroachment of competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory in room of Aeronautics comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the biggest version of the A350, which compete directly with the Boeing 777-300er.
Airbus is starting to increase pressure following a request from its customers to increase its ability to charge and autonomy.
The Boeing Company's actions have increased by 1.5% to reach the 67,94 dollars.
The Mexican President's sister clearly beaten in elections to the Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says that the drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo the PRI in the race for the post of Governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its bid for access to the post of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and has declared Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of its opponents.
The initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race for the post of governor of this state of the West.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio in an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They have threatened our candidates, our election agents... they have taken over the ballot boxes, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But it organizes its return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to not be unusual little Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognise Vallejo as winner.
Silvano left aureoles, Candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles has also refused to recognize the results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any link with the drug traffickers and has urged the other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialising in the smuggling of marihuana, heroin and méthamphétamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he has chosen the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a pan was murdered when he campaigned for mayor Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally in the campaign by fear.
But for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections of Michoacán have the air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think that this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
The basd urge Asia to help the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a fall in the long term to prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the basd based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the faster growth of the world should "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the eurozone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
It is inadvisable to BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China - to look at the problems of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and indicated that an Asian financial support with the leaders and resources of Europe would avoid a collapse of the world economy in the long term.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"So anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected up to a point but it is not safe."
"If China and India can help, that there is nothing stopping them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, Italy's cost of borrowing is dangerously soared and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe did discover the worry that the global economy is in recession, and gave rise to the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro zone to find a solution.
Mr Nag Asian présagé that the IMF acheminerait any aid, but he has also said that the bilateral aid - as buying bonds in the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater power to negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister for Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro zone as its economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a decreased the influx of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have a monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.
"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because when trouverions-nous work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans when they are facing their own economic challenges.
Ashutosh varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day, they discover that the Greeks retire at age 50 and they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed, which generate jobs losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause "significant impact" in Asia.
The basd's forecasts for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia 2011/2012 face now "downside risks" because of the threat.
He said that emerging markets vulnerable needed to develop "rescue plans" to protect itself from an economic turnaround and major capital fled.
Severe warnings by the Pentagon defence on the potential cuts
Defense secretary, Leon Panetta raised the pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic cuts imminent saperaient national security. it has triggered a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon in the battlefields of Afghanistan, through the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon digère already $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts or imminent if Congress can not agree on spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, r-arizona and Lindsey Graham, r-south Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the kidnapping, would lead to 23% of cuts and the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied and indiscriminately, make the most of our vessels and construction projects inoperable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously affect other efforts to modernize," wrote Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate civilian and a number of our staff, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly send civilians to leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes ébranleraient the faith of those who support our soldiers and our preparation endommageraient seriously."
The cuts would be imposed if the combatants, continues Panetta troops.
"Although the contingency funding in TIME OF WAR accounts abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the budgets of basis," warned Panetta.
"contractor staff would be reduced, leading to delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract who support the war."
"staff managing salaries would be reduced, with late payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would would trigger a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed global leader of military power."
"We are strongly opposed to this drastic action," said the senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"This is not a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not what we should be."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
As the letter of Panetta and recent warnings Senators are increasing the pressure for a compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon budget cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vociferous about possible cuts, even though he himself has the highest post in the Pentagon budget cumulant years of expertise in Congress and the White House, and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary has painted a bleak picture of what may happen - a core with a shell, but not military.
"It is a ship without Marine."
"This is a brigade without bullets."
"It is a fighter, without enough pilots trained."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs who do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," said Panetta during his introductory remarks at the Pentagon.
"is a force depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with the potential adversaries."
"de facto, invites aggression."
In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta expressed specifically how to further cuts could generate huge operational risks: deadline for a response to crises and conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations. "
Defense and Panetta said that some of the largest projects could move to chop, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
The list included the fighter f35 Joint Strike, a new bomber planned, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new ground combat ship coastline and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the navy.
Stop the development and testing of the f35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step to improve and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at the recent stuff indicates how deceit and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican presidential contender Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of betrayal for allegedly covered up reports that a football coach in retirement has sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been caught by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsé countries.
The member of Congress from New York and Internet famous Anthony Weiner went for a fool with a swift denials refuted by the evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of financing campaigns linked to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, no one who has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in his second term on ​ ​ sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating on tests of the school and university are legion.
There have been cases where the teachers have given the responses of the tests for pupils in order to see on their performance evaluations.
The sponsors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How deceit, let us meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lies hopes.
Another study showed that foreigners are lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detect or spot lies is a key competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades society, where the goal is to écrier: "I had you," the detection of serious deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities having conducted a thorough search of such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the most ancient myths on lies have been démystifiés.
The Liars look you in the eye.
They do not always bégayent or feeling does raise.
Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie détecteur can discover the truth at the facial structure of the declaration, the micro-expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time.
I have spent several years at scientific findings in the vast body and still emerging knowledge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of the modern deception is a matter that is easy to learn and useful to navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management.
Good liars are clever to read others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitive sense sensing how other spot them.
We know from research that the extravertis lie more than the introvertis, men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "Focusing on the other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that people married less often lie to their partners than unmarried people - but that the lies they tell tend to be enormous.
We also know that if you are seen as a mécréant, the rest will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First of all, look at the behaviour of your subject.
This is what is known as' establish data benchmarks. "
It helps to provide a benchmark for measuring the subsequent changes.
Look at the position of your subject, laughing, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone remue normally his feet continuously in order not unfair accusations when you see move their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Verbal then want evidence of misleading behaviour and not verbal.
Consider these figures as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Misleading people can tie up the body when they try to remember their history, they can hold their feet to the door, to lean toward an exit, significantly change of position or present a relief "post-interview exaggerated" - a sigh of relief, a change of position when all the difficult questions were adopted.
The interrogateurs often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to spark the reaction post-interview.
Also, heed to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Peterson Scott has gone through the past this while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search for the return.
Misleading people can also use language outpaced: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky or repeat quite a difficult issue."
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a "hangover" in his response to a difficult question: "Well... if I remember goods... to tell the truth to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic bullet to the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognise the deception is possible.
These powers will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimisation by arnaqueurs in their professional and personal life.
The controversial pipeline plan will be confused late after the threat of approval of the United States
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of the pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, causing anger among unions while appeasing environmentalists - The company seeking to build the pipeline said it is ready to direct the project to get back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive areas of Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill in Nebraska.
The official TransCanada, Alex pourbax, says that the company is confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a permit for the project until it receives new federal studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of Nebraska dunes and aquifer ogallala, vast underground water sources.
"It is a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican Nebraska to Fox news.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department would probably have delayed a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the political involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, has described the decision as the State Department's decision, and he expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline extension of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It transporterait 700 000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it should cross six states.
Hatred is something by environmentalists, but loved by Working Groups, who have backed the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators Nebraska opposed to this plan are pressing for a law to force the remoteness of the region sand from and the aquifer ogallala, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study under the State Department found that the project would have only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry has said that separate the Inspector General of the Ministry has ordered an investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, would be a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is whether a company that has been embauchée to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti Labelle sued for allegedly caused a young child to vomir fear
A family of New York says that the diva disco Patti Labelle embarked on a spate of violence in the hall of their building in Manhattan, terrified girl to the point where it has spewed fear.
The singer tirade "Lady marmalade" spooked the small Geneviève monk aged 18 months, so much so that she has suffered "personality changes, increased sleep disorder" and "fear of foreigners," said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year when the technician of Kevin Monk scene, his wife teaching kindergarten, roseanna, and Geneviève themselves from travelling in a family.
When Kevin monk would seek the car roseanna monk descendit in the hall of their building the head Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, with Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna monk said she was arrested near the door and put his daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said: 'Do you know what your daughter?" I said' yes' and I went, she's looking. "
Labelle has admonesté with anger the pregnant woman.
"she told me of an aggressive tone:" You should not let your daughter near the door, "said roseanna monk.
"I said: 'What you say or think, am not interested."
It has become enragée and has begun to use jurons - the word "and" a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to Asperger water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to her: 'Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
Labelle has dumped on the mother, who was always Geneviève in his arms - and had to be restrained by his entourage was brought to a car that the expected, said roseanna monk.
The little girl began crying so hard that it is beginning to vomir also says that there would be a flight.
Later, the family has sent a note asking for apologies Labelle, but there was no reply.
The lawyer and representatives of Labelle have not returned our calls for comment.
The complaint calls for damage not specified, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received in a cancer charity for children.
"The aim is to take Patti Labelle accountable for his conduct," said Mr Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher wearing a child of 18 months."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and the informalité increased foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, auto-appelé of change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, the increase is not, for there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, apart from causing any trillion for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities for growth, state of the economy have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mostly justified by the historic 31,16% decline in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the allocation by the frozen report issued by the Mexican Council of sustainable rural development, there was damage to 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, a total 78,03 percent have suffered damage and the rest of 21,07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were the vegetables, corn and peas scant.
The drop in economic activity has generated until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of the state's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year we have seen an increase 55 thousand 053 accelerated for the January to March sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4,53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5,28 percent and from July to September, the average has continued to raise up to 6,19 percent, a rate which represents more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in the multifactoriel Sinaloa during the year, according to The Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the measures taken by public policy.

The Court validates the analogue break in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signales by the exchange from growing is a more important than the world has suffered recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice in the nation - scjn - has undercut the constitutional controversy that the senat and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advances the analogue 'break from 2021 to 2015, "because the eight votes needed to invalidate have not been met.
A minority of four Ministers, ci-inclus President of the Court, Juan Silva MEZA, considered President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree, which outlines the actions to follow in order to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the Constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, has been déboutée for not meeting the qualified majority of eight or non-constitutionalité votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The sentence, developed by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero project, proposed the statement of the decree as non-constitutionnel, due to the fact that the Rules of radio and television is an allocation reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission, cofetel, in contravention of the principles of subordination hierarchical and reserve of law.
In favour of the project have voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna for And Sanchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have promoted two constitutional controversy over the decree and Sanchez Cordero giving the complaints, the Minister has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions of these for the digital transition.
The plenary session of Ministers has resolved débouter The complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project which the Minister Sanchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive can not structure through general standards for public administration is preparing measures.
"I do not believe that if it did it affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he mentioned that the strategic planning of public policies in areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue signales by digital is one of the most important changes signales that the world has suffered the last few years and this is reflected in a better use of the radio spectrum, signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, soutenu-t-il would postpone the profits of digitalisation which involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, has souligné-t-il, require the operation of a whole system sets, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution gives the executive authority of the state. "
He pointed out that a large number of countries around the world have already finished the digital transition, and they did it through the executive, in spite of the fact that they had the strong technical expert bodies.
We can not conclude that the executive, contested by issuing the decree, has invaded a form the competences of Congress because it holds in the Administrative Law Enforcement sphere issued by the legislative assura-t-il.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government, which faces an economic crisis that brought the country to the brink of disaster
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government, which faces an economic crisis that has put Italy on the brink of disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti appointed Sunday, could meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a government.
It is expected that it presents a cabinet composed in its majorities by technocrats, even though it is not clear when the new Executive will assume his post.
Monti said he would present to the President the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempts to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well established," ajouta-t-il.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a smaller time that normally, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt at levels not to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy, which had been affected.
By highlighting the pressure on Monti to market instability it gets to put Italian bond yields Haitian construction to 10 years above the 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu saved.
Emma marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we very much support this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to sort of this emergency.
The chances of success of Monti have been greatly encouraged by the support of the FDP Party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis has forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said to the press angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre right.
The support of the FDP, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its Members were opposed to the Government of majority technocrat Monti form.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement unpopular austerity terms of what probably will be the reforms.
Every block or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign quarters is coupled with the pressure by remarking that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti has begun consultations with political parties, trade unions and groups Monday bosses and juvenile and women's organizations.
He will end his tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who authorised a rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the cost of Italian debt is now back to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of eurozone.
Monti has said that his Government would continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that the terms of politicians will only time to implement the reforms before moving on the elections.
Monti said he would include politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by experts, an index of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties make the test to include political figures.

The Spanish footballers who play in the league of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain the year an intense activity in the National League and Cup championships and arguments in cuts as the European Champions League.
To this must be added the experience with furia Espanola during the complicated connection of the European football and the World Cup.
The footballers costariciens, by contrast, have little international experience to an area, as the concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.

This is an excerpt from the conversation, which the full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet.
For his followers costariciens, the fact that Pearl Jam happens to Costa Rica is a dream come true, do you know what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us.
This is the second time in Central and South America and to date has been magnificent.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is so beautiful and I think that we can spend a few days.
So we émotionne to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying in addition to us for all these years.
They have taken 21 years for us to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so many had to spend up to this concert.
Some are already saying that his concert is the show most of the year.
It adds a bit of pressure to your visit.
Some of the variety show greater than we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the past two weeks.
We have offered two huge variety show in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very keen to produce it.
We love this country, we love of surfing and the jungle; the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How do you discovered Costa Rica and Its waves to surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfeurs and I have a very good friend who lives in tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends would always make The surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, side of Mexico, are great places to surfing; it is as we have learned, through the gents like surfing.
When the tour, you with offered enormous variety show, with great songs.
What do you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good repertoire and diverse.
You never tell the script.
What is this?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine records and we can interpret more than 120 different songs and everyone loves songs, That is why it is so difficult to decide What songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the script that we no longer have interpreted this for a very long time, help us to stay focused and surprises because it reminds us of the reasons why we aimions these songs and that we can have forgotten.
Is that the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.
With this tour, you célébrez 20 years of course.
Looking back, it is difficult to believe everything that you managed?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years that it looks like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and continue to make music together, we émotionne much.
We love one and we create worship music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things could only get better for us.
That means to you having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
This was always an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are friends with the people of Soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a Group created a city, but it is much more bizarre when five or ten groups come at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group in Seattle.
We play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we had a festival with Alice in chains and we have been in Canada with mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden in their tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle its arises.
It is very strange that a United Group as your continues and with the same people for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt, Cameron has joined us 13 years ago, and only much more time than many groups had normally.
First of all, I believe that we are all fortunate to be alive and, secondly, we are all for the others.
We are all intimate friends and music through that there are boulevards that give freedom to each to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music of everyone and it can only get better.
Your relationship with the famous word was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you can do what you want.
How is a balance?
As we have grown, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of great multitudes of people and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that the people are there for the music, it helps us to remember that we must respect the music and it has provided, without being put in mind the fact that there is famous and a rock star, which does not really interested in all of us.
How you remember your other project, mother love bone?
I think we were writing good songs and at the beginning it was awesome.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not produced a record before the death of Andy - Andrew woods.
There was a lot of frustration that it took so little, and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very, fairweather, friends with Bruce and Greg - Gilmore - which started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture to the incredible person I think Andy has been and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about the music, football and many other things with him.
It was an amazing human being and we are lacking.
The Las robertas national group will show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent videos with different proposals and this was the group that we liked the most, so we are looking to see what Las robertas can offer direct and it must be very distrayant.
Why change you always the words of yello Ledbetter live?
It is a matter for ED - Eddie vedder, so I do not know.
It is he who sings and I think it does with the first words he imagine.
As bassiste, what influences?
There are so many...
Among the first which I remember there Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk the whole afternoon on the bassistes that I love.
How has managed Pearl Jam keep raising the grunge in spite of the fact that he is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think, this reminds me of the groups that I just mentioned, as mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana and all those who have created at the same time, and if it is under now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music which is worth listening to and groups such as mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
At the beginning, his music was a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album seem more light, but there are also songs, as the end and just breathe qualified as songs very obscure, even if they can ring rather positive.
With the two, when Ed has occurred to me, I cried when I heard and they are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grandis and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, is it for me.
I also believe that we can also be happy and obscure music even as it can be done.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength that it has in the pies informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years of age, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government - 1990-2000 suffering from various illnesses, language ci-inclus cancer for which He was operated four times and is under control.
His personal doctor, said the congressiste Alejandro aguinaga for canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of néoplasiques diseases to determine the reason for the lower pain and loss of strength from its members.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the cancellation of the punishment for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that it does not want it because he is innocent.
He was operated four times of tongue cancer, it has a loss of weight pondéral 18 kilos, and other diseases, such as a gastrite érosive severe, a pancréas kyste, calculations, blood pressure and kidney problems of circulation in the feet, has listed the doctor.
Fujimori is serving the national prison since September 2007 in the direction of police special operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a Escadron annihilation of the army, which has operated illegally during the early years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official trail, with President uruguayen heads, José Mujica, and trained various ministers and bosses, initiate this Tuesday A visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and deal with political issues in the region.
Mujica meets next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point for a long agenda of meetings with political authorities, trade and a meeting with the Community uruguayens residents in Mexico, according to the broadcast by the Presidency uruguayenne agenda.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive for the exchange of information in the Political Affairs between the two nations, according to information published by the South American country's Presidency on its Web page.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to persuade Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the agent France, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American countries on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that has led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations with its European ambassador to that country.
Mexico Chair since November the G20, a group formed stronger emerging and developed countries in the world, with the South American country, in force since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government uruguayen tried the years to send the implementation of agreements to exchange tax out of the "GRI list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, integrated by countries that do not implémentent all international standards for cooperation on tax.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have a free trade agreement in force since 2004 - TLC - which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber happening in three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D land"
Super Mario tireless, for 25 years has fought to save the Princess Peach clutches of bad Bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D land" It struggle for the sake of the younger stéréoscopique technology.
The title, which arrives this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the start to exploit the characteristics of the mobile equipment Nintendo 3ds, which can play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the man who must say what should be the stéréoscopie without glasses," said the head of press specialist Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "The first video game Nintendo designed originally for this support," because the success so far as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda 3d: ocarine of time was adaptations of existing securities.
Nintendo's spokesman said that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible" which allows some quickly and smoothly.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" for onto users less nimble.
Once over, most experts will make a "second round" levels of game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will choose to real time between an 'aggressive' or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it should be played in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and not succumb to optical illusions.
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also demands the return of the character of a mobile equipment, a fact that was no longer since 2005.
In those Nintendo video games is a nod to the adherents of the saga and repeat the formula for success in the previous games, which is the fact that the moustachu plumber must go platforms worn dangers to release to the Princess Peach.
Even if I find new player in the movement, the environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the case of Luigi "possible."
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that it had given orders for the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy to laundering $70 million Americans.
THUS ends on trial for Guatemala responds to the north of the country which was Portillo demand for the judge.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision follows the independence of the judiciary and executive taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his term he had not helped in any judicial resolution and it gave way to all the extraditions that he had.
With Portillo, Sergio ruano marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada moral and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited to drugs.
What Colom did assume an executive approach after having exhausted all constitutional courts and to judge the former trustee of the interim 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the fifth Criminal Court and the Court of constitutionality, CC, Portillo should be extradited having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed their human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of q120 million for the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial before the extradition, but the prosecutor has appealed and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped to 6000 young in risk
It was created to avoid the marginalisation of young people without training
The results of the first 25 years of life for the body of social support trinijove is important: 6000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during the quarter of a century.
Added to that is the long centenary of jobs being achieved by this social group.
The anniversary was yesterday to take stock in a celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra Act I coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the trinitat neighborhood Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people poorly trained, without work, with problems of drug addiction and marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu made a large number of officials of entities and institutions in these 25 years worked with the association.
The diverse political representation in the election season, has shown the unitary character of the work done by trinijove.
To side of the President of the Catalan regional government, Generalitat, Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the Socialist former Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall Act and the former deputy mayor the mayor and current councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
Fabra I coats were also in the great hall of the current Minister of Social Welfare and family, Josep Caixa Lluís cleries and the chief executive of charity, Jaume lanaspa.
MAS said that current trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that it is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The President has given trinijove as an example to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is nothing new for the body and the work that it does," he said.
Overrun by squatters property for micro-fêtes, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate to 11 of the 13 flats in the building, balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
All indications are that the nightmare that the residents of the street number 51 balmes lived ended.
Twelve people have voluntarily surrendered at noon yesterday the building they occupied illegally and where they had micro-fêtes désespéraient Neighbours, by judicial order and without the need for intervention by the police.
At the end of the operation has been changed the lock of the door to prevent the situation again.
"From this day there will be a access control," affirmât administrator.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 13 apartments in the building - the rest were habités-, have won the power plant and a separate part of the water, to paint the walls and leave residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three flats were the scene of celebrations of masses, which lasted until two days ago and désespéraient tenants.
In addition to building a disco, balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria has explained to pantinat Europa press from the occupation of the building his case has fallen 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property were unfair competition because they were selling the glasses to three euros, while in the disco they was 10.
In addition, the owner of the local leisure had been responding to complaints from neighbors for the noise, while, whereby the problems were not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the House occupied and above all the participants in the celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense these past few weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The head of the Disco said that the problems were so large that it has reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it is nine months that it "Forgive him" The rent.
The Guardia Urbana - municipal police also confirmed that the last few weeks they have received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
President of the city the PP of the mayoralty, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had approached the past week "the immediate evacuation of the building to finish with the problems of cohabitation and civics that it turned to residents and the deterioration of the area."
The popular leader said that before the summer just one floor of the building was occupied, but the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the flats and in some flats there has been some flights.
It is in this spirit that he added that "we must end the impunity and implacable against the antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Yesterday, the Mossos - Catalan local police evacuated a building at nou Barris.
In 15.30 hours the police moved to the street number 35 mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people accédaient of the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the possibility of convening beyond the argument about the fees
The city contest on the 16 new door opens the debate on the role of collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the Metropolitan déjà-éteinte Corporation of Barcelona, CMB, this administration has printed promotional affichettes collserola.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become once again in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that does not move on the north and south, or high - mountain - axis - low - sea.
The qualification of collserola as natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was more central park or Yellowstone with wild in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the Council has convened a méga-compétition composed by 16 contest for all the doors of access to collserola.
A door calls the idea of park, no doubt.
That is, or someone wants to put the doors at the field.
The question transpires alone: collserola: park or mountain?
The contest, both in terms of its organisation as the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation in all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of the ancient caste elected talk when they themselves in a lift.
And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide Barcelona three architects, university professors, which were presented.
Miguel roldán, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: The competition is timely.
For roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to discuss" The Mountain "because the speech in front ildefons CERDA Green, the patés homes has not been brought to end.
"should start on the basis that the Barcelona is the largest park beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "which gave the verdict the architect for the title of" gates of collserola "contains a" trap lexicon: we can not think of them as the access to a park, but stable areas where we must act. "
Modol, as roldán and Bayona town with experience in the world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some peril."
The Perils drift of "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum "his songs of swan."
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build itself.
"Limit means making something already the next step," that is, its excess.
"We must think to new development, planning, because the current instruments... to the Metropolitan general - PGM - can cause real damage."
By taking over the issue, modol opinion that by simplifying the spilling of the El Valles region of collserola "can be heard as a park, Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work by the patronage of collserola "must not be lost," Thanks for the opportunity that the mayoralty offers its corporation to intervene in this project, "from the first moment."
In addition, it wants the proximity of the mountains to the city is the free ticket that allows architects to enter the debate, but "Doubt" If this emerging technology must send lead the multidisciplinary teams' a success, "he said - that it is creating," We, architects, should be just an instrument. "
Bayona hinted that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complicated because of the contest it lacks a comprehensive view of collserola bases: "We called 16 horizontal - he says - in the sense montagne-mer competitions, but it is not a longitudinale reading that path and understands the area as a whole."
This is, at least in this case, it has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In a different way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the programme and with the definition of the architect of the door neighbour.
In his opinion, yes, the Council should ensure that the strip immediately more than Ronda Dalt equipment should provide, in all its extension, an area which makes a smooth transition between the city and green.
Apologies to jonás casino larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal basis for power of the red gave the forgiveness from the brother of the mayor of Monterrey casino for The trial started against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years arrested, Manuel jonás larrazábal will be released after the legal based power of the casino red grant forgiveness before the second district, which follows a criminal court trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on casino, the owner of the casino Royal Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which présumément Manuel jonás demanded the payment of an economic quotte to him that the mayor of Monterrey allows the clandestine operation of the House from playing.
After the public denunciation, the prosecutors opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor paniste and on 2 September it was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's agent 3 of property crimes, he was transferred to the detention centre 1, located in the old district of the capital of the state.
He stayed there for the 49 following days when we gave him a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's agent has undercut the crimes of corruption and organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the centre of cadereyta criminal présumément for singing with one and a half million pesos the owners of the casino red; but he spent only a few hours in the average security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial reserved in the cells of San Nicolás municipal los Garza.
On 25 October trapping an order has been issued by the registrar of the second district Criminal Court, Jorge yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence confirmed to determine the guilt of jonás, such as on the collection of 1.5 million pesos for the House of Representatives stake in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the legal basis of power of the casino red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before the judge José Luis pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore it could get his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent asked the Public Prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, García Gómez if the damage had been recovered, and that of members of the House of game was a man who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer has tried not to report the name.
Under the legal issue 197/2011 forgiveness has been granted to jonás larrazábal and later we will submit any claim on the trial against him; it requires no damage and no punishment.
After the hearing the legal basis of power of the House of 15:50 noon game we ordered the immediate freedom of larrazabal bretón.
The Clerk of the Court, Jorge yánez, has moved to the prison in San Nicolás municipe los Garza to communicate to legally jonás that he had been pardoned and his case would be classified.
It is to announce the immediate order of freedom that the judge has issued.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez jácome gives out the details of the crash in which has lost his life government's secretary, Francisco Blake and another seven people
The secretariat of communications and transport, SCT was informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government has lost his life, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the soil in complete structural integrity, and that the pilot can try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez jácome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot has found that The climate conditions are adequate to fly.
"The Elements that indicate that the unit had various contacts with the soil, the pales have had contact with the trees to 25 metres where the unit has lost fuselage."
He also informed the fact that the unit was designed to 19 people, I met the requirements necessary to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigation made in the area of impacte do not provide the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"A search was reported that there was no coins or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact is presented in structural.
"the helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The soil had an inclination pante from seven to 30 degrees.
For the moment, the secretary said that the priority is to have the results as soon as possible, but the investigation could last a few months, it can take a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of airports and auxiliary services made sure that the moment of impact, the Presidential helicopter of the major state worked in speed of cruiser and happened on a weak ground ascendancy.
"It supports the idea of a normal functioning cruiser at the time of the impacte," he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the Aviation Regulations, the flight was done according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have the visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather:
The reports in the aicm mentioned adequate conditions during takeoff, and as as the aircraft went to the border area between DF and the state of Mexico there were layers of obscurity with low grade.
Roads Selected:
It is likely that because of the conditions of the crew has sought an area of obscurity up weaker and more visible to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impacte.
Details of the impacte and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impacte there has been no loss of control or altering the flight paths.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in an area reduced:
The information available so far suggests that the impacte took place on a course right and lateral.
The dispersal of the remains of the aircraft model suggests that the helicopter encountered on the ground in terms of structural integrity.
It has not detected traces of fire or explosion:
In the place of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft to a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that the aircraft had been repeated contacts with the ground.
During the work of ground was found pieces of the aircraft to a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground was a slippery slope that goes for seven dégrées inclination to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which he is possibly désarticulé throughout her journey.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with soil.
After careful research in a broader area that the place encerclé around the accident, it has not found disperses parts of the aircraft, which has the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
SSM announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity
Social Security is an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is borne by specialists in the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social insurance - IMSS - has announced that he will lead an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called Protocol genetic of obesity in children and adolescents who will have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the investigative unit in biochemistry of the hospital medical specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, said that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and assist social.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students, Insp, of the National Institute of Public Health and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, cinvestav - IPN.
In the investigation are invited to participate the population with right or not, to come to the IMSS sporting units involved in México Valle, where is the evidence to minors all samedis from 8:00 hours.
He said the Protocol has started in the sport Cuauhtémoc unit, Estado México poniente, and from 8 October, the activity is taking place in the nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit, Estado México moving.
After achieving the goal of raising 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the sport Independencia unit, south of Distrito Federal and ultimately in the sports Morelos unit, the Northern Distrito Federal.
He said that the purpose of this investigation and that e deal the components and the importance of the gene for the development of obesity and identify among children and young Mexicans of risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate the 14 November, the day of world diabètes, he mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, to the application specific questions relating to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of heredity diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger of illnesses such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed the samedis we apply to all participants of measurement photographic, weight, size, circonférence the size, blood pressure, determination, triglycérides glucose, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic - the one seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity.
Cruz López said that this investigation is the result of the health professionals' concern for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"health surveys from 1999 and 2006 pointed out that there has been an increase in just six years, in the case of the boys of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in the overweight has been seen as a dramatic increase, souligna scholar of IMSS.
He said that the justification for research markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from other genetic by its history.
He informed that, on average, the Mexicans have a 65 per cent of heredity indo-américaine, a 30 percent and five percent African and European this condition is reflected in the people involved in the diabètes and overweight.
He said that in general the genetics of obesity is unable to consumed the excess energy that we consume - calories, which settles in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which helps to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obese.
ILA even said that the presence of plis dark colour - acanthosis - on the neck and the avant-bras indicate the likelihood of suffering and even pré-diabètes metabolic changes.
Confidential information is handled in a way, doctors put in writing to parents, which you explain each of the measures and changes in lifestyle that they need to prevent diseases.
Cruz López said that there are three main components that are overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the sédentarisme daily, which is the lack of physical activity, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the television and use of means of transport instead of going on foot for short distances.
Another reason is the high calorific, the largest carbon consumption of drinks sucrées hydrates - tamales - meat to pâté wrapped up in sheets of maize, corn flour, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc. - with a high content of fat and protein and the genetic analysis in this Protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphaltes modified with polymères to produce a mixture with a better returns, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the signales that the streets were resolved, it is no longer necessary to repair around 200 thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the metropolitan area of Valle México, warns Rafael Herrera nájera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry - FQ - of the UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of stone tar is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its Technology Conference an opinion on the blackcurrants, held within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for developing asphaltes modified with polymères to produce a combination with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with more mechanical strength, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera nájera estimated that this type of modified asphaltes could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve returns, and therefore, the training of blackcurrants.
He said that asphalt, the biggest oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, of molecules with a larger molecular weight, known asphaltènes, and with low molecular weight, called malthènes molecules, which together give the street his behaviour viscoélastique feature.
The viscoélastique behaviour of asphalt is the fact that high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees C its viscosité is great and 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while very low temperatures, asphalt is dropping, ajouta-t-il.
This means that in the asphalt streets resistance is not uniform and changes during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researchers of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad México in their majority were covered by a stone flexible, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the layers more superficial is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones baignées asphalt and compactées later.
Each of the small stones, which form the signalât-il layer is named by year asphalt.
When the vehicles are secure efforts, it allows the forces spread very well in the streets.
Asphalt if we had changed, they propageraient better, opinât chemical ingénier.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, there is a final layer called, made in Rolling Stone cover fine, i.e., sand which is also up asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it needs more mechanical strength that the layer of asphalt and provide the grip on the streets.
As part of the street who gets rolling and distributes the efforts, the layer also requires that it has a proper thickness and material it is made should be treated.
Climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he says, because they greatly affect the performance of the layer of asphalt.
When the soil is wet, water is within the layer is it is difficult that it so, which ramollie all sections of the stone and therefore cause of blackcurrants.
With the formation of a blackcurrants trials, he says, the first rolling spoiled is the film and only later goes the layer of asphalt, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated the first signs with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the national system of researchers said that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of stone must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its frequent satisfaction, to prevent the formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, the émulsions bitumineuses, which in other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without the use of high temperatures.
That has failed to Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors which have only Melina Ramírez serna will not gain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives his number 14 of Princess.
Valle del Cauca was again with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez serna has had to be content with the desire to be on the podium on money winners, wear the crown and the gang who accrédite as new princess of Colombia.
With the result last night Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has risen with the Crown and the sceptre, the amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina department is one to a legion of Valle del Cauca women who found themselves near the crown, but have been proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam ospina Benoit, 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero, 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala, 1979, Lorena Alvarez, 1981, Rose Mary alzate, 1983, Olga Maria arenas, 1987, Leila blanque - 1988 - Mónica Evers - 1989 - María Consuela Pinedo - 1990 - Diana Isabel Romero, in 1993, Giselle Garcés aljure, 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure - 2008.
Now the big question on many minds is:
What has failed, because the result is the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia because it had not been elected in vain QUEEN OF THE police and best beautiful of vogue, obtained by the Queens taliana Vargas securities or have won the crown of Miss Colombia Natalia Navarro.
The first factor considered key to the decision by the jury of the name first princess is the fact that it has not convinced with his answer to the question "what has been the paper was and why? You asked by Martín Murillo Gomez, of the carreta literaria leamos.
This Valle's candidate's answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, I believe that the final book which was my childhood is' the little prince 'is a deep enough paper.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment, this is a book of universal literature that We should read all; and now I read a book by Irene nemirovski, a Russian, a very nice paper called" The passion of the blood. "
This response was not very fond first because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly not to explain exactly how each city had marked paper.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result, "The universe and wise, there is what needs to happen.
And for the World, Please read a little bit, "the little prince" is a great book '
Between the assumptions launched there is that Valle was destroyed by nepotism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the preferred the ovationnée and the candidate who received all the preliminary price - Challenge of gastronomy OSTER craft, the public's vote for the best suit, and Queen Mother, "has awakened the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not excelled on the stage."
And it has been noted that in his first presentation in wearing swimming costumes to the beach of Hilton and its two marches on the eve of the coronation.
Even if the two marches she felt confident, we noted that it did not have the strength and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, Journalist of the programme "Como in Casa" - and at home, the Channel RCN said the fact that Melina had been designated PRINCESS "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the price for the competition does not receive the Queen's crown."
In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another possibility is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.
It is for this reason that legally binding two days before the election the international Lucy produced Doughty said that they were seeking a woman committed to social measures in his country.
"Only the beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before starting the competitions are already involved in the projects," expliqua-t-elle.
One speculates that Valle was guilty of failings in the backside and fibrosis observed in his abdomen contradictory, but it is precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate natural beauty with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.
The initiator of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco notes that Melina did not have the best body, that it was better, "but the problem of fibrosis on abdomen, which actually for me was not too plain, has left him points on the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine cromos considers that the mistake of Valle's candidate were the surgery she had suffered.
"The chirurgies are good, but Valle did not make them.
His body has never been its asset and she lost because of this. "
For that price, the beauty contest national calls for the first time, after the parade in wearing swimming costumes has created a cruel prediction that was made last night, it was said that it was a gift that raymundo was Melina not to give him a taste for the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as sovereign, except as princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in international competitions by national nominating contests.
However, it will in history as a Queens despite his splendid passage by Cartagena, did not reach the Crown.
And was the work of the person of Cali who has identified the body of Alfonso cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali happened in history as the man who has confirmed the death of Alfonso cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November dactyloscopiste of CTI Cali has happened in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the FARC, "Alfonso cano" confronting their fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes working in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of availability of eliazar González, a man of Puerto tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes Chocó, where a lot of times it had to spend five days in the forest in order to reach the place where were the bodies that were identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and having follows the right way, he has dedicated dactyloscopie Skin, which is the study of friction, i.e. the paumes and their feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso cano clothes are warned to eliazar to take with him for at least three days.
Something very big completion.
Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter to palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and we suspectait that one of them was the man who headed the guérrilla oldest in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León sáenz - his real name.
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognised by his physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He did not have a beard, it was habillé as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much smaller.
But the fingerprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and then eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
The eye has not misled: it was "Alfonso cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto tejada was the responsible has confirmed the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos pinzón that yes, he is the Supreme Leader of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a sijín Cali the recognition that dactyloscopiste President Juan Manuel Santos has made eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against cano, "is very significant."
A lot of people not know our work.
The dactyloscopie is an exact science, with no margin for error, which could be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support the investigation for crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of people captured.
When caught, many offenders are false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and seek in the database.
The researcher Conté flight in a case it had to remove a part of wall of a house, because there the thief had supported his hand to bring out a coffre-fort full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we managed to get the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights does," still remember.
Fingerprints can also remove or confirm the suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently there has been a dead man, with drink bottles around him.
For interlude of investigation has determined that a parent can be suspected of the crime and a mark on the bottle coincided.
Not even if it no guarantee that this is the murderer, the place on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopiste CTI explained that it extracted the fingerprints of things with reactive chemical or physical. "
When they occur, it uses a préleveur or a band for the levy.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the national civil register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," identified the CTI expert.
He said that not everything is how it shows in the television programme CSI.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that it does not become forcement affects an imprint.
It can be used, if the confrontation being necessary.

"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stand again in the square, We will settle in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," dit-un spokesmen of the "occupy Wall Street" movement, Bray mark.
Bray detailed that the response of the indignant at the disposal of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court, where the judge Lucy Billings has issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the outraged have occupied a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the tunnel Holland, between New York and New Jersey, nutrition in the parish Trinity church property.

The organisation insists that there are centenaires people who were based in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders shifted in sign of support to members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them to the police.

The judicial order banned the authorities to evacuate the members of occupy Wall Street or implement the laws published after the beginning of the occupation or again to ban the demonstrators to enter the park with tents or other properties that they used previously.

Japan returns after the earthquake
GDP rise a 1.5% through domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of decline in the beginning of March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, convalescente even after the devastating earthquake that has become Japanese nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster since the Second World War.
The government's initial estimates of Tokyo have calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the gross domestic product data between July and September have served to finally turning the page: GDP has raised a 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
Higher than the second quarter - to the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and the since tsunami.
In fact, the companies have increased their investment by 1.1 percent, compared with a fall of 0.9% capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of rising non-interrompue.
However, the true will of the Japanese economy is based solely on the Keynesian stimulus calls to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to also giving rise to very low.
Japan has roused mainly through the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents the Japanese 60% of GDP.
This variable has raised a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has called the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become a refuge "values" elected by the investors fleeing in eurozone debt crisis and the unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege that loomed as a dalle in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of technological flotation is determined by the economic health of large groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the EU markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries, the Government of yoshihiko Noda does not drop our guard.
"We must follow the risks persist, as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic policy, motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - OECD member mentioned that most countries have presented in September with clearer signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy has highlighted that the major Powers have been curbed.
Because it has fallen four décimales until 100,4 points, compared with 100,8 in August.
Eurozone has even been above average, which is in the 100, N lowering eight décimales so 99,13 points.
Athens is fueling new doubts
Papadimos said the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign no written undertaking
With the peripheral triggered risk premiums and uncertainty relocated in parks, Greece continues to confuse the maze, which led to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "Consensus" of the new transitional government hellène is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than real conviction of political forces beginning to be borne out by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas papadimos mentioned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural terms of the reforms and that the period of 100 days sets in his appointment might be short for them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, respect to antonis Samaras, assured that it will not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections for the datte scheduled, on 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," said papadimos yesterday when he opened a debate which will tomorrow with a parliamentary vote of confidence for the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reforming the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, respect to the message of Samaras no emerging doubts about its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The leader conservatif went a step further in its pulse that EU and IMF, Which bodies must release the 8000 million that Athens needs urgently, and has made clear that it will not approve any letter of commitment made adjustments.
But the European Commission, even angry by the impacte caused by the va-tout the referendum papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: he would unleash aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties hellènes do not sign a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible. "
The spokesman for economic affairs, amadeu altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika would go back "very quickly" in Athens for talks with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche of 8000 million, even if there is a definite date.
They still have much to do.
The Queen sofía: 'These are instruments for progress and hope'
The Queen stresses the prominent place of Spain for this type of Finance
Spain has reached a leading place globally in the role of micro-finances. "
The Queen sofía reminder that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor to the world on this instrument of cooperation that the "essence" lies in the fact that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being."
The Queen opened yesterday the V-E world summit of microcredit to Valladolid with the certainty that there is no doubt that such activities are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2015, and "very specifically, within the goal be reduced to half the volume of people with incomes below a dollar a day, which is set the poverty threshold.
Spain continues to work to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and assumes the task with" responsibility, "said the Queen sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and inputs origins for the summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved a lot of objectives" and "we face a lot of challenges."
The microcredit summit is seen not only as a for debate, but also as the platform from which we must give "two basic goals."
Thus, His Majesty said that the aim is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who responded to these financial services and 100 million of these families out of poverty in which they live now.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated a few years ago a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as a "universal idealistic admirable in the cause of the fight against poverty," the work which she has since 15 years ago, When The Queen has travelled to Bangladesh to deal on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the First World summit in Washington and other meetings as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and at every meeting I saw a continuing evolution, "said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project has made yesterday to be called" head of family gathered in Valladolid "from the" banking for the poor. "
Finally, the Queen sofía ended his speech by encouraging people to take part in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"étique imperative"
The External Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity is a étique imperative for any democratic state. "
In this sense, it argued that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez considered the microloans are "a serious and rigorous dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now more than ever, "the governments of developed countries" must work under the criteria of solidarity and does not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, the microcredit is "one of the main features of development cooperation."
The Secretary of State for international cooperation, soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success of "confidence" to give people "excluded that all close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the infected people in a city "opens its doors to the cooperative spirit."
The CDU proposes the European president elected by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union, CDU, Monday 14 November in Leipzig, was without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor, but also President of the Christian Democrat party.
The future of Europe was not originally scheduled the program, but has imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government policy too lax on Greek today and perhaps Italian tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted unanimously.
On 1001 delegates, there were only nine voted against and 10 abstentions.
The standing ovation for several minutes that were right, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile, left no room for doubt.
The idée-maîtresse Chancellor - and the motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace but because "Nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen control of the European Union on fiscal policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "To give a face to Europe."
This is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the 27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is asked.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority, the proposal to consider the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the weight of each economy, which obviously meant to strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious to appease the climate within his party, has increased the references to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not sought to win its congress on the backs of small European country or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe spends a paragraph to the importance of "friendship from Germany," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
The fact that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
As the fraud rulings disease?
After the benefits, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the judgments disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against fraud and the social handouts.
And to accompany this offensive, who wish to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease judgments.
First to the budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of deprivation for employees in the private work before taking charge of a ruling.
Clearly, without specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill lose four days of wages, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that could arouse anger, but which would yield 280 million euros, according to the Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, to impose more symbolic significance: the officials a day of deprivation not compensated in arrest of work - they have so far not of weakness, against three days in the private sector.
While these issues are up for discussion, the majority also the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse recovery related to the judgments of work.
"Controls will be much more important, and, if you are caught, you rembourserez," warned Xavier Bertrand to him RTL Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the announcement effect seem somewhat disproportionate working with the reality of the fraud rulings.
It is indeed the subject since 2002 to continuously monitor and offensive policies, which have often borne fruit.
The French no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Attardons we first on the national figures.
According to the National Insurance Fund - CNAM - more than 237 million euros daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of health, the daily allowances were 5% of health spending in 2008, with 11,3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were the rulings disease, or 6.2 billion.
And therefore 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have experienced an average of 14.5 days of work, against 17,8 arrest in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting.
An average that hides some differences: another investigation, published in 2007 by the monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of French 40,000 employees questioned said disease arrest has not taken any day.
Another study, this time from insurance, says that in 2010, 37% of rulings disease were lasting less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% above.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are not working more inclined to judgments.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence for health reasons or not, oscillait, in France, between 10% and 11%, 15% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud rulings disease is very little in the black economy.
As for fraud, it is only a small scale.
The strengthening of the law since 2002 that the systematic controls are on the judgments disease more than 45 days.
In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the CNAM noted that 13% of 285 000 made for short breaks were "unjustified or too long, 37 050 case.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, 11% of cases were "inadequate or unjustified" on 1.2 million, or 132 million.
In total, 169 000 cases "unjustified," on several million employees had a halt disease.
A figure who is very little face, for example, to that of the black economy.
Made according to the UMP Member Dominique, author of a report on the issue in June, which represent 9 to 15 billion shortfall in fiscal year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and infinitely more than recent fraud.
Papadémos adjustment: Greece will implement a new plan
Greece will require another adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This Monday 14 November said the Prime Minister, Lucas papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given his unity government would not accomplish this task.
"to continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment," said the head of government, who was giving his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 October will be the main task of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Mr papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced to around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, having been 10,6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Respect to antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, has given its support for the measures already agreed Monday to try to break the debt crisis but warned that his party does not engage on a further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He said agreement with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, and to combat waste but hostile to any policy that bars the economic recovery.
Has Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has warned that the IMF and the EU does not débloqueraient the loan of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantee of respect to all the parties that they will support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his word and that it would not enough under external pressure.
It legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a Committee of Experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the Health Committee calls for governments, institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian Society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctors about the conditions under which they want to die and to take measures to that effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked to various areas, including the ethics, law and medicine.
This committee is recommending to the Government to amend the Criminal Code so that the assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is, from a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who described the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of proven death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not proven, 77% of Canadians do not have access to the palliative care, report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68,6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths that occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said will not change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are regulated or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation leads to abuses in the application, which is the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people not competent or consentantes.
Instead, said yesterday in teleconferencing Jocelyn downie co-signatory of this report would be of more cases such outbursts in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn downie.
The Canadians support euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia is not to send the message that the lives of disabled and elderly people is less valuable.
As people who have practised Assisted Suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be pursued.
In terms of maintenance or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was no legally valid is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also called for health professionals are trained to duty to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the Health Committee calls for governments, institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
In terms of terminal palliative sédation or already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be seen, when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps me, specialist in health law, called "extreme" the position experts signatories of the report, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia terminal patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask that help it to commit suicide," said Deschamps me, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
I Deschamps also stresses that the report's authors appear to have the autonomy of the person above all other values which are part of the social fabric of society.
In society, "he said, however, there are criteria and constraints."
Health lawyer Margaret Somerville has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "manifesto pro-euthanasie."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular dispute the data in the report about the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan called President Assad from power
Damascus condemns' plot '
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures have intensified yesterday on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their stands and denounced a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and neighbouring Jordan, Syria, have come out in favour of a departure of President Assad.
Yesterday, King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to leave power in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were killed.
"If Bashar took to heart the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the conditions for a new phase of the Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the leader of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not in Middle East peace with their people and can not satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to the neighbouring Syria, a country where Turkey takes a hard line more.
The United States is on their side welcomed a "Strengthening the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's actions" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey to adopt an increasingly tough tone" with the repression in Syria, was Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have died in the Deraa region, in the south of Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - osdh.
Two other civilians were killed in exchanges of fire and shelling to jobar "heavy machine guns in the besieged town of HOMs, as the NGOs.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid mouallem has estimated that the country is "directed towards the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus of its work, which according to him "is a dangerous step."
Syria does not shrink, "he said," ensuring that "the ourdis plots against Syria fail."
After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now a "mechanism for protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arabs of human rights organisations, media and military observers in the country.
The French foreign minister, Alain Mr Juppé has also called for sending observers to the UN to help protect the civilians of the regime's repression which he is retreating into the "paranoia."
A new league's extraordinary meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the plan to end the crisis decided on 2 November and that includes the withdrawal of forces from cities in the dispute and the release of protesters arrested.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, while retaining support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifice the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, called for a little time to markets for his team and implement a programme, which will include "sacrifices" in order to recover the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before today to meet the unions and management.
It should establish a relatively small Cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
Monti has spoken of a "major programme with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco nucara, a member of one of the many small groups engaged in the talks, after meeting the President of the Council appointed.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part said expect Mario Monti request by a vote of confidence in Parliament Friday to ensure that the new government has a sufficient support.
The consultations will be completed by the presentation by Mr Monti a limited list, perhaps a dozen ministers, the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
He said the tension in the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them time.
In "democracy, there are deadlines for a government and its programme," he said, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but concern back particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister should be appointed a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would include "policies."
The new government must continue until 2013, the date of the next legislative, he estimated.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti, once opened, promised to work in an emergency and in order that Italy "once again become player" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on Italy's economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new austerity measures.
The Italian employers' Emma pulling marcegaglia, who will on Tuesday, insisted on the need to revive the economy, because a country that has no growth can not meet the parameters of deficit. "
Mr Monti, known for its competence and independence as European Commissioner, 1994-2004, represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of berlusconisme, "the professor" symbolizing the challenge of "serious" and "other Italy, according to writers.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 to 200 billion euros of government bonds.
A Russian scientist has helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, vycheslav danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO specialising in the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security, Isis is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic IAEA safety and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA announced last week its "serious concerns" about "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to Isis, drawing widely in the documents of the IAEA, Mr danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in tcheliabinsk, Urals, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company that produces "nano-diamants in Kiev.
THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS of its society have led to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
It would then have cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA says "strong indications that the development by Iran of a bang 'nuclear your system has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew of this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology in the nuclear weapons program of its country of origin."
The anti-Muslim crimes and offences have risen by 50%
The crimes against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has fallen slightly or made little progress, according to FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims has risen from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49% increase, compared with an increase of 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offences against the Jews and an overall increase of 14% of crimes anti-religieux.
The total number of hate crimes has increased slightly to 6 628 cases, 47,3% driven by differences of race and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes increase again," said the human rights organisation Human Rights First, "the increase in violence antimusulmanes is particularly significant," added the organization in a statement.
"Human rights first has long stressed that the violence against Muslims, and all forms of hate crimes must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible organisation, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," it added, arguing that it could go through an improvement in police reports on the "crimes of hatred."
The "hate crime" in US Federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence linked to the race, colour, religion, now the origin and gender.
Twitter changes its platform and is more like Facebook
The site of Monday micro-blogging Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, partly to allow users to monitor the activities of those they follow, making its service more resemble that of Facebook.
A new onglet "ACTIVITY" and another "Name" to provide more direct lisiblement in the activity of other twittos, people who are following the Messages' tweets' and those who follow you.
It lets us know if they follow, if they abonnent messages to new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc.
This new formula of Twitter has been tested on a small percentage of users in August before being broadcast on the network Monday, told AFP the spokesman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its operation little instinctive, with somewhat esoteric terms - RT for rediffuser a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user - which the happiness of the insiders, opens to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users discussing through "tweets" settled on the merits of this innovation.
"It is unnecessary, invading and it seems too much to Facebook," wrote @ jemb123.
"The functionality activity will help me to better monitor elements of my Twitter," wrote @ dannykronstrom flows.
Austria
On a fiscal "golden rule" in the Constitution
Great Social Democrat / Christian Democrat coalition in power in Austria's government decided Tuesday to add a fiscal "golden rule" in the Constitution to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible degradation by Austria's sovereign rating agencies of the bill - triple.
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner faymann who has even announced the decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74,6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered one notch, from AAA to AA +, we pay 3 billion of interest in more every year," argued the vice chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister, Michael spindelegger.
Austria and reality following a request from the member countries of the euro zone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government were then called the listing by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or the law of equal value.
The measure adopted by the Austrian government closer of the German model, Germany was the first European country to adopt such a rule.
By 2017, the structural deficit will fall each year from 0.75% of gross domestic product - GDP - and, starting in 2017, the federal government's structural deficit must not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities to run budgets balanced.
The aim is to increase by 60% 2020/21 public debt under the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threatened a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the authorities nippones would ensue once again on the foreign exchange market if the yen should continue to rise.
"We do as we did the last time we see excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen," said Mr Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back not far from historical levels that led to the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo has sold heavily on yen against billions of dollars in order to lower the value of Japan's currency which had just set a new record of force against The greenback since 1945.
But the yen is regularly climbed since, has boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has risen Tuesday under the 77 yen, and the euro has fallen below the symbolic of the 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last speech.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of Japan's currency night for exports of the archipelago because it renchérit Cost of goods made in Japan and reduced the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them in domestic currency.
"Japan struggle to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of tohoku, northeast, said Mr Noda who fears that the higher yen killed in the bud the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has found growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the quarter précédent- for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption plombés by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister said that the cost of the yen does not reflect Japan's economic fundamentals.
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, for its part called on the Bank of Japan, BOJ, which opened Tuesday, a meeting of two days of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that it had already taken the appropriate measures, "implying that no further monetary easing was expected Wednesday.
Emissions at its last meeting in late October, the Institute has risen by 5,000 billion yen - 47 billion - its purchases of Treasury bonds, changing 55.000 billion yen - 519 billion - the ceiling that it devotes to purchase securities various amounts for flooding the market with liquidity.
Euro zone:
The rate rise, stock exchanges flanchent
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines the European indices.
Despite the appointment of new governments in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rate of vulnerable countries continue to rise.
Always concerned for the stability of the euro zone, European stock exchanges are a little more into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, 10h, CAC 40 losing 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The DAX is 0.4% in Frankfurt and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the yields of borrowing in the euro zone states in trouble, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker among GIS markets, quoted by the news agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, who in turn the renewed fears of speakers from the market about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchange will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilised, believes mitsushige Akino, managers of funds among ichiyoshi Investment management.
The renewed concerns over the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
To 10h, the European currency is 1,3570 dollar in contraction of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting Monday, Congress has passed a motion that includes the opportunity for a country struggling to emerge from the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The mortgage rate of Italy and Spain remain very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, Italian bond yields to 10 years at 6,85%, the Spanish securities maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rate of the south, but also in France, continuing to fuel the fears of speakers.
The head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti has requested time for the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by suffocation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has, however, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the "most important task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the firing line, while markets are Sunday for parliamentary elections in the country.
The "'spread' 'rate gap between the obligations to 10 years of Germany and Spain historic has reached a new high.
Pending the eurozone growth figures
Hand statistics, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, which is a little better than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
However, the INSEE has been revised downwards the figure of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of the gross domestic product - GDP instead of stagnation.
And, it was the fourth most worried economists.
Germany, meanwhile, has increased by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole of the euro zone is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has to warn against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogma
If there is one issue that you can not treat from considerations of short term or under the emotion, it is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an electoral meeting is an opportunity to reflect on these issues and instead there is nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French have to base their opinions on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic changes will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge proportion of the world population of a vital element.
At the same time, we must address the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity at all times, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes the over to the need to find an alternative source to replace, or Switzerland, which is just not built to last generation plants.
By contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination.
The US, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit with their central park with the construction of a suspended after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the reality upsets the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher prices for electricity, energy dependence compounded by the increased reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these negative effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to entertain.
Champion of Europe to the wind, he is 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas in the intermittence wind; according to that, CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% respectively and 50% higher than the European average.
Instead, thanks to the resilience of our energy policy, our neighbours pay higher electricity bills by 40% in the French households.
While in a global economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping the industrial plant at home, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction of the nuclear would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which make illusory fine words on reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
That a large majority of French refuse to pay a price, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show.
Remember that our country's energy policy has helped build an industrial sector of 125, 000 jobs directly and 410 000 induced jobs.
Strong exports, it involves a galaxy of specialist on international markets, and makes them very creators of jobs non-relocatable.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, this would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing alarmingly 6 billion annual exports French nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician commanderait an EPR designed to operate 60 years as the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
Energy to solve the equation, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity generation, any more than there is evil.
Development by issuing Areva little solutions of CO2, testifies to the complementarity of nuclear and renewable energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintain the highest level of security is an imperative.
In France we have a regulatory authority which has strict control and transparent on the existing plants and flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is acknowledged, are inhabited the same security obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, came in normal operating conditions; he remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors led to the tragedy.
For Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
Result of this and cooperation between the French and German security authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR is a concept making it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is regarded by all electricians wanting to build a power plant, the judgment of its construction flamanville would be a wonderful gift given to competitors from Areva and EDF, leaving the way open to grab the key leadership in the development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek out the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogma and partisan tactics dominate a debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Immigration policy conducted under Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles -engorgement police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of political figure, compatibility of this with the Statute called "countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment are subject to foreign students who made the news, the Interior Minister, read the release of 23 May, declaring in passing, that France "does not need foreign talent, builders and restaurant servers."
But it is rarely seen in economic terms.
Is that there is a broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
Has the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 said that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not take all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For both sides, they are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that we daignera grant towards immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to the mundane, indicating that the development will resolve our migration "problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem may be off électoralement; but it is economically very expensive.
As the recall Ian Goldin economists and Geoffrey Cameron is the latest in a recent book synthétisant knowledge on immigration - exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp., there is a broad consensus among those on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia and night employment growth.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can replace the national workers, particularly those with few qualifications, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, they are much more complementary as national substitutes for employees, who essentially jobs in sectors In shortage of jobs.
Unskilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which national job training does not supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon will find it hard to work in a country with a shortage of anesthésistes, these complementarities between national and migrants are that the influx of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of national.
Giovanni PERI has calculated that an increase of 1% of the migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity provided by the Immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth - high proportion of immigrants naturalized American among the Nobel Prize, Google, Intel, paypal eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants.
Migrants are also contributors of social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution - revenue less spending - by an average of 150 euros to public budgets 000 throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the start of term, to find the missing points of growth "with teeth."
The teeth, for to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy remains to think European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a very fragile.
The European continent should remember him for having invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, has experienced during the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Colonels in Greece.
Some were able to believe that he would, for democracy triomphât definitively of its enemies, to have the vote, and to do so in the most straightforward way.
Since Napoleon "The small, we know that it was a facility of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even be "instrument of oppression" as Republican said once the philosopher Etienne vacherot.
No democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, and control separation of powers, an education, of the Enlightenment, of solidarity, an economic and social justice.
Europe's crisis we are facing is an economic crisis, but it is equally first and a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie Greek vrai-faux referendum has taken on this value double revealing: the need for a strong RETURN OF THE policy, but also a sense of disturbing the failure, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic contest are now displaced, and that, for many of them, the soldiers republicans are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organised according to the needs and separately.
The European absolute monarch or a blank cheque feet joined a leap into the void of the nationalist reaction: what a choice for the citizen.
Not going ahead, we do not want any blows but a joint exercise, a full, calm and continuous, and choice of democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - can not be more where stop the list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
Europe as a whole is bent to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which hurt Its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Being concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty the steering of the European project.
Because together, that the Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing.
Emergence from the crisis represent decisions at European level which can not be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
Having fought long this proposal of Socialists and Jacques Delors Today, everyone wants the European economic government.
Is.
But appear without a strong political integration and more democratic, and seen as such by citizens, would be a new madness and deadlock.
We must accept a new stage of European integration.
For the Republic in France, it was' do 'of Republicans.
The revolution in the interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson is still valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
In Europe, are Europeans.
Smart cards' without contact 'spreading
The salon of the world opens Tuesday in villepinte smart card, near Paris in an optimistic mood.
2011 should be completed on an increase of 11% of global sales of cards to microchip - bank card, phone with Siim - card, more than 6 billion, according to the Cabinet eurosmart units.
The most prominent is the technology segment without contact that helps pay public transport or simply to settle its purchases in approaching the card reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold around the world, from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share should go further in 2012 - 580 million units expected - and represent nearly 10% of the global market of the smart card - 6,925 million cards.
Long behind of the Asia Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the payment without contact.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped this functionality and 75.000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start is more modest: 400,000 without contact visa cards have been deployed.
But supermarkets are hard.
Carrefour has issued this year MasterCard carrying out 2.5 million cards pass without contact.
To move up a gear, we must now that banks are their customers.
"Two major French institutions are committed to disseminate the systematically to their customers of cards equipped for the future without contact," says Gérard nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Test mobile payment by banks
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC technology - near field communication needed to carry out transactions.
"They have fallen behind."
"But they should finally have a real rise next year."
"We aim for the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Credit Agricole announced yesterday in Caen December the launch of a test in June.
The iPhone of approximately 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a étui authorising the payment without contact.
The bpce has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale, too, said yesterday preparing the marketing an offer for its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
In Nigeria, the terrorist front extends Sahara
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb - aqmi - and the Nigerian sect boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algeria has now "became certain."
"The way the two organisations operating and intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said without more accurately.
Paris seems to be a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have exposed bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of aqmi Antoine de léocour and Vincent delory were killed the next day at the same time that several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
French investigators in the rubble of the speech and Nigerians should find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
An analysis of past calls moving towards several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale, RFI, two numbers of particular interest to Investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has travelled extensively in MAIDUGURI, a city in Northern Nigeria, the birthplace of boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to aqmi and the sect.
"It is a step forward, but it will no doubt be more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"known for years that the sect has external financial support and intellectuals, and that it is increasingly active," dampening Kunle Nigerian amuwo, a researcher.
In recent months "support" had been increasingly evident in the development and the language of boko Haram now and in his methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and even bill than those used by aqmi.
The international community, including Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of theorists little interesting.
A swift victory
Founded in 2002 in MAIDUGURI around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, haoussa boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - Advocates of an Islamic law in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a swift victory.
It is politise and requires a strict adherence to Sharia law and its militants committed the central government fight against the infidels.
They aim of all the churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, the militants of boko Haram are particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, unsubtle.
The army invests the city, there are 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will be radicalised and leave its northern fiefdoms.
At last Christmas, it claims an attack that left 80 people dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that boko Haram is qg secure the police during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations International will be its first target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia in Nigeria now all the experts concerned about security.
While aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis to al-chebab operate in Kenya, boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Mr Juppé has warned against boko Haram and said that he was ready to share all information. "
The world according to the Republican candidate for the presidency
On China, Iran, the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival oversimplification and ignorance.
An America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other growing loud statements and the shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, Iran, the aid to Israel, the slogans - often not backed - fusent.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the Grand old party, has threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and the challenge "for their currency manipulation," a bearer theme in an America exasperated by the migration of swathes of industry to Asia.
Too bad if it must involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama ex-ambassadeur in China and only candidate to have a sophisticated understanding of foreign policy, has failed to strangle to an attitude that flatters the emotions.
He called for a late but constructive dialogue with Beijing - Obama's current position.
But Huntsman stagnating in the depths of the polls is inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I stop Iran, he fanfaronné."
"If Obama is reelected, they will have the Bomb."
He has also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of defaulting on its obligations to the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate best placed, has about an embarrassing misunderstanding of the files.
Recently, he called to counter China's military threat, because Beijing is trying to develop a nuclear capability, apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the atom military since 1964.
The Texas governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, is ready, in turn, to engage the American army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is not 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a lorry in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan had simple ideas and that it has won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give some ground for terrorism.
They rightly stress the failure of its overhasty naive dialogue with Iran on the departure of the "Boys" of Iraq, its procrastination in Libya, collant him and a small label.
But the attack is not so easy.
Obama's people judge rather positive assessment of national security, which has eliminated Osama bin Laden.
In Iraq, it is wary of military intervention that lead to deadlock.
And economically, claiming that it must rebuild America to revive its leadership, Obama is more fair.
Nord Stream, the new ntrée door of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, linking directly to Russia to Western Europe at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with shine.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government were involved, last Tuesday, on the banks of the Baltic sea, between orchestra and buffet end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline linking directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart mark rutte have turned the steering wheel of the valve commander the entry of Russian gas in the ouest-européen network.
With this new, additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas pipeline will come each year in western Europe with a small tube of 1,224 km from the St Petersburg region in the land of mecklemburg-western Pomerania. Who
A second tube due to be completed late 2012, to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, is the equivalent of the entire French consumption.
Already and it raises the possibility to build a third on the same road.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge yard has something of a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land route via a third country, Poland and Ukraine.
Suddenly, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to influence Russia threatening to close access to European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a new German-Soviet Pact, "in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with his Russian support for this project, has gained greater security of supplies.
But it is the price of a weakening of the Europe of energy, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been in five years ago, direct uphold his vision of an alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries strongly gas consumers, and the fields are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new organic arterial route that links us in," said François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are also political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles worn by the leaders of Gazprom, present in many lubmin gas, to the point of arrival.
The construction of the pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The steel tube submarine is gainé padding to protect it against the ancres ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, to 200 m on average.
To build it, it was not of landmines dating back to World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution," says Jens Müller Nord Stream, spokesman for the company.
It was also more measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupted along its entire length: valve or station maintenance.
A platform of control was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the Swedish officials were not wanting to see a society of Russian state be permanently off their coasts.
"in the event of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the case of the gas content in the pipeline leak escapes in the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have held soudures about a flight every 100,000 years.
State surveillance of the pipeline is held by a robot submarine, dragged by a foreign ship, for observation, and a device used in the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced in the tube, wide of a meter in diameter, and it is driven by the gas.
In the end, after three full days of travel at the speed of three metres Second, it accurate information on any distortions in the metal paper.
The pipeline was designed for 50 years without having to go through any repair work.
The flow of gas is guaranteed by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to make that happen.
The leader is Gazprom, which is 51% of the shares.
Have joined the German E.ON and BASF, 15.5% each, and the Dutch gasunie and the French group GDF Suez - 9% each.
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, built and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.
Renewable Gazprom has also praised the company for 20 years, all of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas really transported," says Jens Müller.
The funding for the construction of the pipeline has been assured by shareholders and 30% to 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the work hit 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, has risen to 240 million investment.
But the minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to lubmin, on a sandy coastline set of pins.
The valves, 4.5 metres high, form the escape of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gases that come before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas at every hour.
At full capacity, it will be in 2012, 6 million and 3 million per hour.
Moleskine brand, a book.
Established about 15 years ago by an Italian company, the moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a perfume adventures, hours to write to light a candle.
The book moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black rectangulaire coverage, elastic, its leaves a broken white colour, as vieillies by time.
However, the book moleskine as we know it today... was born in 1997.
The Italian company roughly equivalent, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of notes design but distinguished.
Maria sebregondi, then consultante for the company, responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is a former technical production, mole skin - skin mole - which designates a cotton veneer used to cover benches for example.
This kind of book was very sought-after writers and passengers.
"moleskine has modernised Something old and forgotten, who was an icon of artists avant-gardistes, until the XX e century," says Maria sebregondi, which became the head of the brand among roughly equivalent.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to establish itself to 12.7 million pieces up.
Confidential is far from the production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Italian moleskine transcends borders and are exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notes attracted both the businessman book that the student and professionals.
In the image of moleskine, its consumers grown and cosmopolitan, open mind.
The small Italian company, which were 12 employees in its infancy, with nearly 100 today and since 2008 has two offices; one in Milan and one in New York.
It distributes its books in libraries, The Fnac small shops downtown and was able to impose its identity.
"We have followed the air time and this need new writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria sebregondi.
This cultural signing with the development of moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition "detour where architects and artists put their own book."
In August, it has also launched a coverage in Leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of his success and this will be cultural, moleskine managed to diversify its products: computer bags, agenda, pens, housses... the brand has on a wide range of media.
A success is appealing: in the autumn of 2006, roughly equivalent was bought by the investment fund SG capital Europe today syntegra, writing a new chapter in the history of moleskine capital.
Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today.
Despite a vigorous public policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Depressing?
"No, says Eric Blanchet adapt, the Director General of the Association held the week for the employment of disabled."
"The progress made since 15 years are considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"But there is still much to be done."
It must be said that disabled for the unemployed, there are many obstacles before access to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years - 17% on average.
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the BAC and the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, long term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
Short, so singularly criteria that make the return to employment, and that is the crux of the problem, "says Christian grapin, Director General of springboard, an association created in 1992 to help companies to hire workers with disabilities.
So much for the brakes objectives.
Remains the unsaid, changing attitudes, but too slowly.
In April, a survey by the ims-entreprendre Association for the city indicated that the managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge of disability," with a "over-representation of people in wheelchair, mental disabilities or intellectuals."
Result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment of 6% of disabled workers set... in an act of 1987.
The latest figures known, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Peter White, Executive Director of the AGEFIPH, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
Proof: the number of institutions "taxed," as the amounts paid, fell between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures - and 606 to 480 million euros.
"The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains white stone."
"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 percent of schools from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "happiness"
Before to face the Blues Tuesday evening - 8.45 p.m. - Eden Hazard and George leekens have not concealed the pleasure that gives them this friendly match.
It will not go up to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side at the podium of the auditorium stage of France, George leekens and Eden Hazard did the peace.
Five months after the gesture in a mood of his attack against Turkey, the Belgian sélectionneur has only praise to it.
"I am very glad to Belgian Eden, its progress and the fact that it is."

"Lille, I am all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my feet."
Spared against Romania on Friday evening in the game against France, hazard comes at Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
Without fail, however, the concept of "Pleasure."
The Blues, he encouraged since the age of 7 and successful campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been Bear," he says.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthen the 'special' nature of the meeting.
In front of that case, "There is Mathieu, debuchy, yohan 'cabaye and adil - Rami, rapelle-t-il.
"We sat just now."
"To play against them, it is only of happiness!"
With bonhomie, for its part leekens mentioned the "pride."

"'To see - Neighbouring" Pride "- that France is" back to a very high level team "a little more than a year after the trauma of knysna.
"Laurent White was a work of thunder, has excited.
As Belgium will miss the next euro, the technician would share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgian are great," he said.
"Something is building, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"will see in the next matches." those against France included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo bento starts its dam return very optimistic about Bosnia - 22h00 - this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the go, the two teams had been realistic.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we are a good team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the selecçao, he is the manettes since September 2010 will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to destabilise.
Given the go - 0-0 - match Friday in the clear Zenica Hell, it transpires that the Games are not facts.
Portugal has dominated the game for more than an hour, but he has been unable to express such a valuable purpose, which would have relieved.
"It is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not scored straight outside"
But at home in their light stage of Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to go, before an audience that should be bouillant, even if the part is obviously announcement "very tight," by one bento optimistic but lucid.
"We look forward to a very tight match, but we are fully convinced that we can take over," said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the euro 2012," still have relativisé Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The Portuguese no reported Friday from Bosnia forces to score and win.
A zero can satisfy the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not taken aim at the outside," bento regret.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of individual technical qualities and has players with great quality," he added.
As Zenica entry, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnian to "not give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
