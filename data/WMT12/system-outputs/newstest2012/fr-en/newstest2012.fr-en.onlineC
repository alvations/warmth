The Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in tallies it of an amendment to the criminal right, the project of annulation of the paragraph relative to the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The deputies have refused in second reading the project of modification aiming at the reduction of the troubles for economic offenses, which would have been able to open the doors of the freedom for the ex-First presently imprisoned Minister.
Tymosenko has been sentenced in October to 7 years of prison to have concluded an agreement at disadvantageous priori with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not definitive and the court must rule on the call of the one condemned in December.
Tymosenko describes the sentence of political revenge as the system and has caused a process of suspicions of bias of the court also westwards.
The project of canceling the paragraph 365 of the criminal right, on the basis of which the ex Premère Ministre has been condemned, has been signed by 147 deputies.
226 voices would have been needed to approve of it.
Libyan victory
The release or Libyan rebellion has already her defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is shelved in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is finished.
It remains to determine the winners.
As it is of custom in the region, the winners to the elections are the Islamists, but it is a matter of the moderate ones or of the radicals.
The provisional National Advice has decreed the usual right of the Sharia and we know already what it is a matter of.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight one cuts the hand.
The women can forget the emancipation, the not respectful possible dela faith are liable to the major grief...
It is the Coran that is going to unite instead personality of the dictator the society composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya règnera such an order as we can not imagine it and as we would not love surely.
But our way of living is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be worthwhile for the Libyan ones.
It is particularly astonishing that the Islamist warriors have accepted the help with gratitude of the unfaithful dogs.
The only one forgives it is that it is not an américian general that directed the touches of the NATO but rather Allah of which they celebrated the size to every attack.
When it is therefore a matter of looking for the winners in Libya, the west is not part
We have participated in the shootings, served the Islam and our poilitiques have turned away from the dictator as political ally without that not taking any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy militarily Libya.
Him not there therefore not of problem for the places of him débarasser of the "crossed" ones.
Without occupation of the ground, will the oil societies have easily accés at the libyien black gold.
Maybe not as much and the west will be able to pride finally on a desintéressée protection of the human rights.
For little that these followers of the sharia prevent us from.

The Iranian students are ready to die nuclear for the program from their country.
They have created a human shield
Some hundred students of the superior schools has created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear program of their country by this gesture in view of a possible Israeli assault.
The students have started to pray at midday in the face of the site and afterwards wished the death of the ones HAD and of Israel.

The feeding of an obese child: does not take small breakfast not and takes delicatessen for the dinner
More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 years have problems of excess weight, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese persons.
As the present investigations show it the obese children come from families that have an unhealthy way of life.
That shows again to what point is important the environment in which the human being evolves and model them that surround it.
On the tables of the obese children one more often finds for example delicatessen 50% than in the families of children at the normal weight.
19% of the obese persons had of the chips to the dinner according to the inquiry taken with an action of sensitization "the Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of the big small ones the sport is not also a habit, what is maintaining the case of most of the schoolboys of today - only 15% has replied that at least a time a week the parents found the time for of the movement active.
Inquiry taken on 900 children
The inquiry has taken place for the last school year and have participated 900 students of the grade schools of Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "the Obesity is not a chance", action supported by the general Assurance of health and the Unilever society.
 From the beginning they are more than 12000 students of sixth to the third that have registered themselves at this project.
One of the decisive factors that cause a dramatic increase of the number of children in excess weight, indeed obese persons, is l'absence,d'une correct feeding and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the questioned children indicates for example to eat 5 times a small day to eat-in case - breakfast - snack- dinner, which is one principles of base of a good feeding", indicates one of the results of the inquiry.
Without small breakfast and delicatessen at the dinner
The specialists attract the attention on the fact that to have a healthy development some details of base such as a small breakfast in family at the same hour are needed.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat to the my same hour.
In the major part of the families each takes his small breakfast alone.
And the worse that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not take at all small breakfast.
Nevertheless the small breakfast is the base of a good daily feeding.
The questionnaire has shown that in the families of the obese children one more often consumes unhealthy chips.
Nearly every student - without talking about the weight - drinks every day of the drinks sweet (70%).
More than 40% of the questioned children makes sport regularly but for the parents it is a matter of the half, only 15%.
Prepare your feeding for you
Another part of the inquiry has allowed children selected (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own feeding from possibilities proposed according to their own taste and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of the Czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, as regards a healthy feeding, of the ideal".
Among their preferred dishes there are many cakes, the meats and the sugar refineries.
"The most alarming is notably a great preference for the sweet lemonades", is advisable in the results of the inquiry.
For the breakfast it is the pastas that have taken the first fair place in front of the white meat.
The children do not have at all wanted of starchy foods and the preference for the fish and the meals of vegetables was very weak.
Cape on the health
The inquiry has shown that the children are ready to change their habits from the moment that they receive the ad hoc information also.
"In the course of a control of a group of participants to the inquiry that had filled the questionnaire after the session with sensitization "Obesity is not not a chance, one has assité to a well determined will of heading for a healthy feeding", indicate the results of the inquiry.
The most marking has been for example for what concerns the sweet lemonades because the children have started giving preference to the water of consumption.
The children have the most often ticked the white meat and the fish as main course on the questionnaire and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech spécialté of meatballs of flour of bread or of potatoes).
The stylist must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals
In an article of relative presentation to the way of learning for the stylists, I have gotten myself a little bit angry of the fact that there were a lot from the beginning.
I did not think about what was going to happen thereafter.
The accounts of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on site.
And it will be worse.
More we approach to the final examinations and more wait for us of the practical exercises and of the information.
And even when there are lessons the Saturdays and Sundays it "truly is stuffed".
This time we do not have with the manager Alenka (at the lesson there is not any boy) treated as the way of dressing the woman who does not have switchboard mensurations.
And of the women of this type it is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other one a body of boy, without particular curve, another of the excess weight.
The stylist must know how optiquement ammenuiser of the wide arms, to prolong a neck or to add well necessary curves.
We have managed thus to underline the character nicely and also not to dress way too much seeing types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and of the pronounced hips and an exhaustive size.
If there is for example a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or the pants do not pass tout,cela is the blow of making it itself to make sur mesure worth.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls perfectly is inestimable.
In a skirt on measure you will feel a lot better than in the one that slips permanently, winds and does not stem from the belt and so forth.
For those that have a male appearance have can to allow a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of stitching tissues, or well still of the embroideries, to itself.
There are many examples of 'diverse appearances' evidently 'and I am happy that I have the whole week to sort all the received information.
But I have also fear that had consideration to it that I must make at home some is too much.
Every trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take the present appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as his appearance, in consideration.
I will owe "habiller"Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know the Secret of Victoria of the campaign.
To the bottom of me, that makes pleasure to me, because it is better to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera that has not taken nearly a hundred kilos lately (do not take my declaration, svp, completely seriously) or well the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from the magazines or look on internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard,comme one says for the final result, expresses our personal style as our relationship with the graphic creation.
To think also about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress thus only the appearance but she creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on products given the tendencies for the handbags, the coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, us has kept of all that.
But that... until the Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty have given a diversified aspect to the session of Saturday filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of fashion and Ben Renc, photographer of way.
Jakub has reminded us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know to use it.
And a stylist of talent knows to work only with one clothing in a different way.
The variability is for this primordial example.
As for example this trench-coat that is owed of being carried in a classical way with some jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also he can dress also the naked body, with low-fronted shoes and to take a picture of it as a dress.
Or well it suffices going back the sleeves or the collar and having a new look immediately.
"Play with cela"a-you him underlined.
But I have particularly appreciated the next advice: "For the work you need to experience the rules perfectly".
"Afterwards you can start contravening to it", has said Jakub.
Finally I understand why one endeavors to learn these rules, that to make with, to which, why, even though in the magazines of fashion one sees sometimes something of other.
No declaration on the processions of way.
I know again, thanks to the photographer of way Ben that the stylist must have many more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say for fashion story that will have ten pages (therefore ten models) I must be ready to in "retailler"au minus a fortnight.
And also, a clothing and his combination with other elements appear completely differently that in reality.
We must reckon with that in the course of a creation of a model.
The fact that the picture and the style make sometimes the half of the succés has been confirmed us by Honza Pokorny.
Concerning Madonna who is not a super singer suffices but his picture and the marketing have made a star mondiale.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of the stylists remains still shivery.
And the well known faces consider them sometimes as useless (it suffices that I know something but what I adorned pass to the second row).
And if somebody is made make a styling of our part, we must count afterwards on the fact that it dictates us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one that it has in reality.
He remains us afterwards that to to sail on google and to check if the infos of boulevard state the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight or she has put on weight etc...
Honza and Mario have put Sunday on the heart that 'it does not suffice to the stylist to direct oneself in the fashion and to know to assemble models' to us.
It must communicate with the people that he dresses and being a good psychologist is thus important.
Knowing to guess the people, not to flatter oneself, to preserve his opinion.
"When one manager you asks of to sort it his cupboard and to fill it of new elements everything you can not throw and it dire,Mon God what horror."
"You will find whatever businesses that you will find pretty and it that you will recommend with what to carry them", said Mario.
This has shown us concretely what everything must contain what one calls the "placovka"ou bag of the stylist.
It is the one that you catch around the size and that you have on themselves as all what you need.
Beside the things clearly defined as the scissors, the rolls for depilation or well still the pins to babysitter, one finds also of the thread of nylon (that the stylist uses to photograph products as bags, or many hats), of the special clips with which one closes a clothing in the back, if it is too much big (the pin or other type of staple are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or well a kit of sewing.
So that us soyions not only of the people that listen but that have tried something in a practical way they have taught to us how ressemeller correctly of the shoes.
And in the course of the photo session in the workroom where the surface is equal, the sole could become damaged, at fortiori at lextérieur.
And thus we have stuck and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors not to hurt itself by inadvertence.
Abilities are truly needed therefore.
Mario has made me pleasure while he has congratulated me for my creation.
The comptence that I state is not for my friend.
This is only a small summary of what we have learned in the course of the second weekend of lesson
I begin more and more to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, which each says what he wants.
The need of speed Le Run is fought for across the whole America.
Review
Originally a race without problem transforms because of a unity of stupid mistakes of people who do not have some nothing to look humdrum in a morning moving to the work.
That fills the ambition up to some measure with each but that does not serve for anything if nobody has desire of making anything furthermore.
The left news subtitled The Run has caused great expectations before his exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need heart Speed already aged and of taking out a kind of game from the feasible parts that would not be counted only with points.
We were therefore curious how are going to be the added passages in the course of which the main hero goes out of his car and makes desire what it has.
As that makes already in the series NFS, the result is completely other that it that one atttendait.
They are potentially games of race of arches but the unity pulls to the bottom because of whatever useless mistakes that exist already for several years.
It is really not mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on behalf of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are taken in the adventure of which the hero main Jack has of the maladjusted problems and to settle them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the steering wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is of arriving the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and afterwards on top of 50 races.
What results from it that every race is made on another route and the stages foreseen in different environments that distinguish themselves enough well ones of the others and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling only one instant that the game proposes him something identical.
Some environments are of overbelieves pretty enough even if the graphic technical level is of the same one type that classify them previous.
Finally it is not the end of the world.
But the behavior across the desert, in landscapes of autumn or well in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in more from time to time brightened up with an atypical élement.
For example in the desert you find in one sandstorm that reduces you in a sensitive way the visibility.
Then in the mountains you must mind what an avalanche does not fall you above.
Beside that the different races are well put together ones behind the others.
There is only a small number only but that suffices.
Him there of the instants you endeavor of surpassing the number asked for of adversaries (as in a classical race) then you will run against the watch (classical dual with the stopwatch) and then still you waits another dual with an adversary.
From time to time you also have the police that enter to the game and that try to give you back the dificile situation.
The novelty are the passages apart from vehicle.
It is a matter rather d'una interactive animation when most of the Jack time escapes in front of somebody and you must help it hitting on the good button at the good moment.
Nothing complicated.
What is amazing it is that there are less moments of this type than what you wait for (to be concrete there are only three).
To the result it is well like that because this element does not risk to bother and is placed, in the context described above, to the elements that brighten up the game.
The model of behavior is in the tradition of the previous games.
What means that presently it is not nothing extraordinary but one can not say that it is negative.
For what concerns the realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the conccurrence the model of behavior is very fine with the type of conception of the races.
Therefore everything is ok.
The problems start appearing after some time.
At the diffférence of the model of behavior, that of the collisions is not at the point yet.
We do not wait of this game for a complicated distortion and of the collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the lesser one conceptualizes way in which comprises your car, it is not therefore completely good.
In the course of the tight overtakings you touch yourself sometimes mutually lightly but otherwise your car part in mad acrobatics.
Or well finds in crumbs.
Thanks to the system of resurgence that is not really a problem but that really annoys you.
The resurgence is made in order to what while you have broken yourself the face or have taken out the game in the setting brings you back at the moment of the last point on the route.
But you have only 5 resurgences only.
When you have used the 5 resurgences you must start the game again from the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool, for the case where something does not happen as him faut,que quelquechose on which truly you can count.
Sometimes the resurgences do not help and the solution must be found in him remémorrant of dissertation the piece of route in question.
The great hic of this game it is that the same actions meet themselves in the same places.
For example there are some bends which it is needed to pass of one some way otherwise that does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given place vehicles "civils"toujours in the same shape that you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or a minute late.
What gets angry it is the situations while you see go by easily the adversary between two cars coming in opposite sense and when you arrive, you, you are needed is to be left aside and the conturner or well to brake.
It is equal if you go ahead of it because it is "such calculé"de way that for the given situation it arrives always close at hand of your nose.
The adversaries have still other advantages.
For all the time of the game, you, you arrive to some places, again without caring about the time, and you have always the same adversary who precedes you to the same place.
That irritates the most in end of game while you roll on a long bridge in opposite sense.
The adversary owes at all costs to pass in front of you.
When it goes by in front of you he conceals the sight of the other vehicles from you in opposite sense and you collide a good number of times.
One can understand that the goal of this game is of making gripping something and full d'adrédaline,mais it is light that you are bored rapidly.
And it is shame because through a model of simple behavior the game is interesting and the places with so much of action that you do not have time of following all what happens.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that it does not have any luck as it to be bored or well about thing of other.
The original idea is the change of car in the course of the races.
You must mind the gas pumps on the routes because you can change most of the time for it of car however the one that you have you suffices.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are ideal for the cities, the American rolled engrossments for the right motorways and the super sports cars to the exotic attires on the very technical behaviors for example on the roads in lace in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know adventure, is very fine with the main system of the history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and to the adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start being unbolted:
This connects itself on-line with the duty Autolog that among others compares your obtained results with those of other players and obtain for you other duties in the community.
One of the blows most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car to the tunnel of the subway (that looks) where you roll in the darkness on the ways (that looks).
Your indicator of speed indicates you between 150 and 200 km/hour (to priori) and behind you arrives an oar of subway that sends you transports it directly to the scrap.
That is to say to the writing we have had a discussion for some days if somebody has really thought during the creation of this game or well if the authors really catch us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not visual extra,mais the part is as a rule pleasant and in some cases really high-octane gasoline.
What bothers it is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not keep the level and in some cases of tragic way.
That concerns especially the accidents with a great number of participants when you do not use a fluid imagery to anything anymore.
The part sound is good and the track is to the choice.
With the aim of pleasing the public teenager to the greatest number and particularly the more a new track sound has been created in the style "I mix all", but one can expect what nobody will buy the game for the music.
General impression of Need heart Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have those stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is a matter of the best production of NFS these last years.
But this game gives the impression not to be finished.
The amusement is really well but prepare you for what the mistakes slap you in the eyes with the strength of a reflector of aerodrome.

Vicenova, Ambassadress to the européeenne Union:
The Czechs behave as négativistes and euro-skeptic ones
"The Lisbon treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I did not expect a so hard war".
"That will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and that all the players get used to their new role", it is as Miléna Vicenova has begun his account at the Faculty of Czech Right the ambassadress to the European Union.
When it has succeeded in describing the different organs of the EU and their relationships in way if comprehensible and visible, so much so that a great number of speakers of the faculty of Right of the University Charles could envy it, it has shown to what point she takes his "comprehensible" motto "and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Advice.
"From the beginning resonated the criticisms that it is tasteless, who he is a penpusher, that it can not rempplir no mission and I must tell that it has cut the breath to everybody because it keeps his role to the perfection".
"It is" a man "that knows to listen 27 member states, well to communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take" "of Europe".
It has explained the new post of the High representative for the foreign businesses and the policy of defense within the framework of a reply to the question: "That is that in the European Union?" "To what telephone number I must call"? therefore as an important step to the uniqueness and a greater legibility of the policy of the Union in view of the states, as is China or well India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cheese to cooked pastry that feels very strong)
Madam Vicenova has stated also the agenda that has lived, lives and lives in a close time the European Advice.
It has described the Czech presidency of two years ago as succés.
The Czech ones have solved the rising financial crisis, the crisis of the gas or well have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It has described the fall as the gourvernement of very negative and has damaged the picture of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is at the moment very busy.
According to the words of Madam the Ambassadress, "the activity has beaten his plein"non only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues decide still now.
It is needed to approve besides of the new septimal budget of the Union that becomes very complicated because of the present economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to economics, what branch will have the priority, what countries will be helped the more, the less, everything is to be solved within the framework of the future negotiations.
Madam the Ambassadress has reminded his slogans with which it has happened in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
"I do not like really the abbreviations, the foreign words, the gibberish that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels nobody makes gherkins round or crooked, of the great differemment bananas or well that nobody has us banned to make syrecky".
She wants to use better the environment of the EU and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe to several speeds waits for us
According to the Ambassadress the Czechs have the reputation of being euro-skeptic ones and people who see the things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Furthermore it is sorry for seeing a so small representation Czech in the European institutions.
The mistake results, according to it, from several factors, as for example the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support of the Czech part.
Beside a Czech presidency at succés it has underlined the strength and the cooperation of the group of Visegrad afterwards.
"Believe me, when come to me the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French calls me: 'Hé, that estce that you make over there, that is still this group of Visegrad?"et it is not at all happy'.
According to Madam Vicenova, in a close future they are new hard rules as regards budget policy that wait for the member countries.
It is the concept of a Europe to two speeds, if it is not to several speeds, who prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro zone and of others out of the zone."
"We have the space Schengen, we have also the institute of reinforced cooperation".
In first place it was said that cooperate among them the countries that want it and those that do not want it remain in their corner."
"Many institutes of this type will be and a Europe will be really to two speeds", expects Madam Vicenova.
Of this viewpoint also she has appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye of determining the bases according to which all the themes having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not only the memebres of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovator IBM begins the second century of his existence
If anybody had to look for the term that expresses to the more to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a wide IBM public is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very present and however for his creation it has gone by a hundred years.
The base of this strategy in the long term has been thrown by the first leader of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
It has left this slogan that a great number of world problems can be settled for little that the people are anxious to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!"est become the imprint around which is going to develop the life of a gigantic future (and also the title of the magazine interns that IBM started editing in 1935).
It was the base of the culture of the soignement firm elaborated by Watson.
For us IBM means a thought in the long term of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the made one that it remained always faithful to his values of base and however has not been afraid of changing all the others around it.
That has allowed us in the course of our first century to transform the technology, the business and the society.
We hope that in the second century we will affect still plus"a délaré for the birthday the present manager of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the years thirty, started to take care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have the paid vacations, one assurance paid by the employer more a uniform of elegant employee and a well elaborated system of rewards for the inventors and the commmerciaux.
In the same IBM way has a sytème of relationships with the well elaborated customer.
The society was initially inspired in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished every form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The present plan is completely in the mind of the anti-discriminatory strategy since she will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - that should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
This works by IBM for thirty years and occupies presently the post of Sales Manager, Marketing and of the Strategy.
IBM in the course of the last years is what one calls of the jamy, of the brain- online storming from which stem much of future strategies and of the innovations.
It is not astonishing that it has many ideas - in the firm it is close to 500000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external picture of the firm that assures him a sure position in the domains of the businesses.
"From the IBM beginning had a concept rather of institution that of a technological firm", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Teacher of economics to the School of economics of Harvard and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technlogique firm but a firm that helps people of the business to solve problems using his technology", added Geogre Colony of the firm of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says it there is a difference between to enter on the market and to create this market.
IBM - or well the "Med", as it is called familiarly in the United States had consideration to his slogan- in a hundred years it has grown up to becoming one of the greatest world firms.
It is evidently the most polyvalent technological firm - it develops software, of the hardwares, infrastructure, lodging, services of Advice at the level of the products of the waiter up to the nanotechnology.
It possesses numerous diplomas of all the American technological firms and five of his employees have received a price Nobel.
Among his discoveries lines up for example the distributor of tickets, the debit card, the financial swap, the bar code or well the diskette.
IBM has met itself this year with 220 billion dollars the second greater technological firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first is Apple), when for the first time it overtook in 1996 Microsoft.
Seen early
They are not all the innovations and fabrications that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not completed the bet on an own operational system OS/2, of the online Prodigy service or a lot of IBM computer PCjr:
"From the moment where your business is built on the movement early you can not not émotionellement to remain caught on the past," made to notice Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM does not have not of problem to build his bases on many plate armors-forms and when they do not work she goes away.
To the difference for example of the conccurent Microsoft that to the base is held and is under the operational system Windows.
A perspective technology
In the incomes IBM, the services, which are formed for one fifth by the software and hardwares, have a predominant place.
However still in 1990 it was with more of the motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM has sold of the active ones to weak yield for 15 billion dollars, in the course of cettre period it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first leader Thomas J. Watson, who in the course of the great economic crisis has also increased his volume of investments.
Him apparait henceforth that IBM pass the present crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action has progessé from 2008 in rocket of 120 pourcent, the net profit of the firm continues grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is of changing everything but not his values.
One can expect for that to it that this flexible giant maitrise of other crises.
History of IBM: From the slices of cheeses up to the flights in the cosmos.
The IBM society (International Business Machines) has been born in New York it is a hundred years; it had initially the name complicated from Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the IBM name in 1924 - initially it was a matter of a brand used by a branch of a firm at Canada and in South America.
The base of the future IBM has been the fusion of four firms whose history is related to the year 80 of the ten ninth century.
They possessed technologies as for example the previous "checkers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and the departure of the employees.
The architect of the new society was Charles Ranlett Flint that up to in 1930 presided over the Advice of Surveillance of the society.
Flint hired the leader of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him to lead the society.
The leader made afterwards shade to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that rest until now the identity and the culture of the society.
Watson led the kusqu firm in 1952.
IBM,comme calls it his name, began with the production all possible machines for the businesses and the business - of the trancheuses of cheeses and of meat up to to the cash registers.
In the course of the four first years during which Watson led, the turnover multiplied up to reaching 9 million dollars and began the expansion of the firm in all the parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of direction it is his son who occupied the armchair of manager, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his IBM direction the development of the artificial intelligence began and developed the first language of programming.
In the years 60 the people and the computers of IBM helped NASA has to guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturne and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Between time in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classical PC that determined the switchboard of computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the one walked in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells his factory of computers to the Chinese society Lenovo, but bought the society of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started taking care of advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that succeeds at IBM these three last years - the concept Smarter Planet "a more intelligent planet" is.
His objective is the intelligent uilisation of the technology in domains not yet exploited as for example the transport and the management of the cities.
With regard to the domain of the IBM business has developed little time ago a platform "Smarter Commerce"qui help the commercial ones to manage the whole commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history also on our territory.
It created his branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first country of central and Eastern Europe.
Today, beside IBM RT, there is also the strategic center of outsourcing of Brno.
The Central one for the Central Europe and Eastern sits in Prague and there is also the team of research and development of the world level that takes care of the gratitude of the word.
Rychtarova about his unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I do not want more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) has said, it is finished!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) becomes bodyguard and lover of of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina hoped even though Joseph wakes up of his dream rose and comes back at home.
Only it has not been able to wait and has established clear rules for the future life.
Pepa can come back at home, but not as my partenaire"a explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave home in summer to Bartosova in his house, she did not suspect that his couple would not hold out.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move of Ricany, Pepa did not repel the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved it.
With the time Darina has resigned itself, has accepted the link of his husband and has ended up telling him farewell forever.
Rychtirova is not interested of knowing who his husband lies down with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate themselves wife will not be to receive it on the step of the door of the house.
"It is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, nobody will put it outside".
"It will not be my old liked and lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship anymore", has let Rychtarova filter showing that it has freed itself from his husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina has closed it the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my woman".
"I will stay with Iveta and will not change".
"My woman has set up a marriage on paper and I respect it".
"The society continues, I take care of the repairings, of the garden, of that property, I buy".
"With Darina one discusses in a completely normal way but we do not lay down ensemble"a declared Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova takes on a new love it will not prevent it.
"We do not lay down together and it does not interest me of knowing where it goes, with whom and if it has a link.
I know that it is my mistake, I have fallen in love d"Iveta and I take on me the whole responsabilité",a concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of the women: Does that also concern you?
If you ask the men to determine typical vices of the women, everyone, ones as the others, are capable of taking them out "of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you are going to know in the next lines feminine vices that happen to pump the blood of the veins of the men.
The purchases
Your half makes you of the remarks that you are dependent on the purchases?
Owe to you you buy at least one clothing a week?
You are happy to buy and by packets at the moment of the sales?
In your case one can talk about the purchases as one vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion of making purchases.
But you will say, which would resist the window-shopping of the stores of clothes, to look for himself for pretty clothes and afterwards to try them everyone in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most of the women buying is a hobby, that can become a real hell for the man.
You remind only how much of time have you says to your spouse that it waits for to the entry...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not big too much"?
"I would need to lose weight to the less than 5 kilos - I should start making sport?"
"Do I please you"?
These sentences do not remind you something?
Yes?
You are therefore part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a great number of men is allergic by the way that their partner is complaining always about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that more the frequency of these complaints increases and more the women become poisoning.
The odre and the cleanliness at the first place
It is as an infinite roundabout.
Washing window them, to hoover, to clean the grounds, to make the dust, to strip the bathroom - and that two times a week.
You make specificity, to the children that they have dirtied the washbasin, clogged the window of the living room, and that that gives you a lot of work, remarks to your partner that it walks with dirty feet on the ground?
If you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to have to the mind that it is not needed to exaggerate anything and that the order and the cleanliness must not be to the first place in the family.
This inoffensive desire for cleanliness can waste your relationships and even the family peace though.
The work of sapping
"Puts this worn tracksuit to the garbage can".
"You intend to put these old socks still tomorrow"?
"A wet serviette does not have anything to make by earth".
If you do this work of sapping on your partner in this way several times a day, you are really going to split it up.
It is evident that you do not think to badly you want that everything is perfect.
Maybe that if the men knew it ,les women would not have to do so much work of sapping...
The slandering, the mockery
The slandering, the mockery but also the insults against somebody are also the specificity of some women.
The women are carried particularly to the relationships and thus are happy to deal with the subjects as whom, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe that each of us lets escape a small inoffensive mockery ici et là.
The hand on the heart it is nevertheless a particularity of the women.
But the worse are those that recommend, mock, even scorn the other and are for their environment - particularly to the work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek have helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphie
The attacker hokeyiste Jagr has participated by two times in the victory of Philadelphie during the match of Monday NHL on the ice of Caroline and is again productive Czech players in mind for the competition.
Of the viewpoint of the star of 39 years Claude Giroux, who has still made a pass furthermore and has been appointed the best player of the match, it has marked in the two cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also has recorded two goals in the course of the match.
Jagr after the match declared to the journalists of beside-Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I have told him before the match that it would give his hat-trick".
"I have felt it".
"Some time this feeling falls you dessus"a explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
An instant later there was a second assault of the Czech team.
Voracek fought Hurricanes behind the goals for the puck and presented it to the striker Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely at Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr it marked three buts,ensuite Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I adore to play with it".
"I do not mean that he is the best player of the league but is really part of the three best", has declared Jagr about his center.
"I had never thought that I would play in end of career with a hokeyjiste as it".
"I am really happy with that".
"I want to play on it".
"All these years to the NHL the other players of the team have tried to work on me, now it is my turn", has added Jagr.
Caroline has made a drama of this match because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a shooting of penalty it finishes with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read has not discarded other complications that finished to two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our zone".
"It has hit on the puck, I have gathered speed and (Read) left to the corner furthest from the cage.
"I have tried to strike it and I have arrived there", described the last goal of the match of his viewpoint Voracek.
Philadelphie has arrived with this victory from the Conference of the East in mind.

The Candiens have not held opposite a defender experimented their advance of two butset have lost after a shooting of pénalty by 2:3.
Marked Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the line defers was ill that especially has annoyed the local entraineur rather than of the break lost because they have played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It is not any".
"We have played the match only with an experienced player, the rest it was of the youths".
"But there is not anything to make, it is like this", said Jacques Martin.

How have the prices of the journeys for 1989 evolved
Up to in 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 agencies of journey of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The agencies of journey at this time proposed journeys especially in the countries of the socialist block, because the journeys westwards were very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled for the vacations in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Sea Noire), in Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Sea Noire) and in Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to by traveling in Yugoslavia then the system started having an inclination as the west and the journeys to Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist time was that him nétait not authorized for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechs) of traveling individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the case where the Czech citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual journey was not authorized.
The agencies of journey at this time offered also journeys westwards however it was needed to queue all night with a sleeping bag or well to have a "domestic connaissance"au breast of the agency of journey.
And even after that it was not yet earned.
The agreement for the currencies that was the condition to travel westwards was refused to the people "politically incorrects"qui could not at all to travel.
The Czech currency was not though exchangeable and obtaining financial means without the agreement from currencies (western currency) to travel westwards was not possible.
The Czechs spent the most often their vacations in the country where consequently it was of numerous country houses and chalets that the Czechs were bought themselves and this habit lasts until now.
The journeys of the Czechs have for known for 1989 a great revolution.
Although up to in 1989 the vacations in East Germany and Bulgaria belonged to the maximum,les Czechs have passed the last year abroad 4 million days of vacations in the countries of the whole world.
The great paradox of which we do not have conscience today it is that the most popular country is the Croatia where it was not possible to go freely up to in 1989 because part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
The suppression visas in the years 90 of the last century in the countries neighboring of the west have caused an enormous wave of visits of short duration especially in Austria to Vienna and in Germany.
The Czechs could not during long traveling by airplane westwards that each wanted to see at least one instant.
For example in Paris the organizations of journeys made the Czechs in tents in the parks sleep because our incomes did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a journey of Czechs was at this time of taking his own food with themselves preserves, salami, etc... to save.
Another important instant has been also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that has allowed our tourists finally after tens of years of being able freely to buy of the western currency.
Our standard of living as the average salary have increased what has caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to an increasing request for the journeys the travel agencies have begun for 1997 to prepare towers with links by aerial charter planes that thanks to contracts have tremendously reduced the costs in relation to what was before.
At the end of the years 90 of the last century the Czechs had links without visas virtually with most of the countries developed of the whole world apart from the ones HAD that later have facilitated our journeys.
Another moment interesting Thailand in the history of the post-revolution tourism, when the first aerial charter plane was prepared to an exotic country, from the Czech Republic.
For this year as every year of the direct aerial charter planes take of the Czech tourists in the distant warm countries; this winter 12 exotic destinations will be from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs that visit the exotic countries every year!
Still a moment interesting in this period who symbolizes our post-revolution development has happened in 2008.
on November 17th, 2008 the ones HAD have removed the visas for the Czech tourists and has allowed to our country ordering itself developed countries completely in the group.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in the history have passed more of the half of their vacations abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time still in the history have spent more than 15 000 crowns per nobody for vacations abroad including the subsidiary loads. Crowns per nobody.
The general assembly must find his President but that risks to end with a situation without solution "a stalemate"
Close to 5mois already the Czech football is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic yet is not known after still a general Assembly that must take place Thursday to Nymburk.
Though it does not exist always agreed according to what regulations of vote one must proceed.
Without this agreement starting voting for one of the three candidates is not possible.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek has given his resignation in June and in the course of his departure has called his colleagues has to unite and to take on a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only for the era after Hasek the football has come back backward to divergences between the bedrooms of the Association that can not be put agreed on a common candidate.
That has completely shown to itself on September 16th while a new president must be chosen.
The delegates of the general Assembly have met uselessly in the national House in Prague because the negotiation has remained blocked and has not even been question of dealing with the way of electing.
Him not there not had agreed on the fact of knowing that has the right to vote for the general Assembly - only ,semble-you him, the statutory representatives or well also the officials invested with full powers.
In this unique point there has been a partial agreement for this instant with the help also of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the fullness to be able is not possible.
The divergences continue always about the regulations for the election.
It is too much light that the executive committee, that in her negotiation planned or extraordinary, anything has not brought either to the situation
The opinions about the possibilitě of vote have changed several times but the neuralgic point is always the same one.
The east question: how to proceed for the third turn not to fall in the stalemate.
"The apple of discord resides in the next fact: is to proceed according to the statutes or well to find another modèle",constatait one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents the football professional within the association.
According to the rules of the predicted model win at the third turn that of the candidates that will have received the biggest voice in percentage within the bedroom for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what one says to retire so that the candidate wins who will have received the greatest percentage of voice of the two bedrooms.
And the Czech part studies the condition that the winner should have the two thirds at least of the percentages of voice.
"Only that it would make to lose afterwards the idea of two precedent towers and that it would make to refuse completely the bicameral concept", admits Svoboda that includes the objections of the morave part and according to whom the best would be of not changing the regulations and voting according to the statutes in force.
It is amazing that Tomas Paclik is as agreed same if he considers that the regulations of the elections established according to the statutes favor the more Pelta among all the candidates.
"I hope that one votes to the maximum according to the statutes of the association".
"So that it is not still of preposterous ideas imagined by a representative as in the course of the passed general Assemblies", has declared the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and that in his accounts has defined itself especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to it to Nymburk a new President will be and believes that the coopèreront candidates in the future unity and in a constructive way.
"The possible qualification today in Championship of Europe should calm everybody".
"The football will be again on a wave of happiness and him there aure more spirit for a coopération"ajoute the officer of Jablonec that among the three has the greatest experience as regards direction of the football professional as well as at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tight".
"It is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want changing the regulations to drawing".
"That can cause again a blocking to the Assemblé general".
I hope for everything as the healthy reason gagnera"a said Rajchl.
It does not remain a lot of time for a common agreement at all the parts.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but that can say if the whole direction of the football will be complete for the match.
The especially chartered flight in which had to travel up to Podgorice among others the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not taken off for technical reasons and one looked for a variant to carry a part of the executive committee on the ground of the retaliations.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, that should be decisive.
The Minister of the education of the youth and of the sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parts torn within the strongest sport association of the country and to lead them an agreement.
In the game there are a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of the football and also the general Assembly of the Czech Union of the Sports that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes away to the fighting for the post of President because he does not see any candidate correct.
If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the general Assembly whose profile would have replied football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) to all what he asks for for a new President of the Association it would not be taken in campaign for this high duty.
"If such a candidate exists I support it, I fight for it and I do not appear to the election."
"But in the present situation finding such a declared candidat",a Paclik to the Czech press agency (CTK) has not been possible.
The motivation of Paclik is of entering in competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for precisely to try to prevent Pelta of reaching at the head of the AFRT that to priori would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik underlines also that if it took away the elections it would keep this post of President only up to in 2013 year foreseen for a general Assembly.
He would see well in the duty an experienced manager and of high level but who is not related with the world of the football.
"I have discussed with people who would have the profil",dit-him.
"For me that has been terrible while some have told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment."
"I would love to make this picture change", it has added.
It that, one says, bothers especially Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the regional Union of the football of Plzen Roman Berbr, man to the counterpaid fame that is known backstage as lobbyiste capable of influencing on the vote of the delegated ones 'the Assemblé general.
For Paclik it is not satisfactory that Pelta occupies this position of President.
"If it won, the present state would remain and nothing would be again in the football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a storekeeper of high flight, that would be still less favorable to the football",a declared Paclik.
It that shocks it still it is the fact that the name of Pelta has been pronounced him there some years in the course of listenings within the framework of an inquiry on a business of corruption, for which Pelta has put through without any grief.
"I do not know what prestige Pelta would bring to the football."
"And how we would have considered to the eyes of the UEFA and of the FIFA"dit Paclik, which declared some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".
In the case where Paclik would triumph to the vote over Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate that had been pressed by Paclik before the general Assembly of September that had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"Him (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go".
"It has great capacities"
"Appearing for example as leader of the representation would be capable".
"But as manager of the Association it would not be capable."
I do not put the nose in what I do not know pas",indique Paclik that in September has attracted a great attention when it has pronounced itself in favour of the annulation of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela that Dagmar Damkova has replaced.
Paclik maintains that it would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as example his capacities to lead private firms and that it leads also for the last year the club of Plzen that has celebrated with his support in last May his triumph in first division.
"I have the strength to make something change in the world of the sport and to bring some culture".
"I would brake the influence of some concerned groups that have for example tendency to influence on the disciplinary Commission and of call, what leads to situations of bad taste," has added Paclik that not chache not his antipathy for the leader of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
He would envisage also a harmonization of the relationships with the Czech Olympic Committee of which the power of lobby next to the policies of high level would allow obtaining more money for the sport from the tax on the games.
"It is one of the key points whose new President should be occupied".
"If it is a matter of the tax on the games of chance as the political parties declare it, I understand their argumentations but also they should say where the money goes", it has declared.
Paclik does not take his present link with the club of Plzen as something of negative even if himself maintains that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again related with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It is not the ideal".
I do not see reason of passing on my actions of the club of Plzen to somebody if I must come back a year and a half after", has declared Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to the situations of stalemate.
Two days before the general Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidate for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if it is taken up, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the regulations for the elections.
The official of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday to very optimistic Nymburk and thinks that the succés today the representation of football should calm this guéguerre before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September that has not been fulfilled has promised to devote itself to the national representation and to the obtainment of financial means if it is taken up precisely.
It is itself determined to be a candidate for the last fair moment before the past general Assembly and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of the football and to present it in a broad context.
"The people at all the levels make football for long and wait Thursday for a President to be".
"They feel that it is the best moment so that somebody takes the direction of the Association", it adds, but it is above all related with the club of Jablonec, has worked a great number of years to the Sparta and to the Executive Committee of the Union.
it is also for that that it consumes itself enough with experiences to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced of behind the topical problems with the election finding itself a euphory that reigned to lépoque of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately to general l"Assemblé of June statutes have been approved of that were not perfect as everyone have noticed it".
"If there were not all these diverse interprétattions we would already have had a President for septembre",souligne Pelta.
It is precisely the review of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in the case where that does not work".
"It is a principle without which we can not exist", has added Pelta.
Afterwards he endeavors, one says, of not confronting itself to his adversaries.
He has declared previously that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that him reconnait had consideration to his training in right and that he knows pertinently that his adversary-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
It does not have either attacked for long Tonas Paclik that on the contrary does not stop of criticizing Pelta.
"It evolves in the football for a year and has already had some succés."
"His attacks were not however most honorable and has surprised numerous people in the course of the campaign."
"It is also as that that some have now doubts on his character", has declared Pelta to the address of his adversary but remains, it says, faithful to the proclamations that it has made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of the football from the competitions of the lowest level up to the national réprésentation according to it.
It should be a vitirne of the football.
"And I would endeavor also to finish all the businesses that begin with that of the Bohémians or well the continuation of the scandal of corruption."
"I would enter immediately in negotiations with the sector public and deprived so that we can obtain enough from money for all the football ", had declared to the Czech press agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
Also it has added that his nomination at the head of the football would not take any change of people.
"I should meet all the employees", he has declared to Strahov where a comprehensible reigns nervousness for that him not there not of direction.
Although catastrophic scripts foreseen with the general Assembly are, he thinks that the delegates will not go at Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of discord on the way of voting for the third turn we will manage to surpass it".
"The football needs credibility and it will not obtain it that while it will be to his head one new leader",comme declares it in an optimistic way Pelta two days before the probably decisive day for his career of official.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If the Vice-President present Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Association of the football of the Czech Republic to general l"Assemblée of Thursday that would not enjoy not to a great number of people, it adorned.
Rajchl promises though that in the case where it would be taken up one will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and to give back the members of the Executive Committee is persons in charge of the different domains of the football.
He has promised also to settle the business Bohémians, to improve the relationships with the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to the football and to continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of the football in his integer".
"International contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA through the national representation, of the professional football and of an efficient football for the youth."
"But I do not say that I will make all that said seul"a Rajchl in a maintenance for CTK.
"I am a player of team and want to distribute the abilities within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a determined domain."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that the great football face one not forward".
"Many" people will not be happy because it will be a matter of starting working hard rather than of criticizing the autres"a-you him added.
He has stated, one says, that it would not imagine as candidate because of an atmosphere criticizes.
"About me, one knows that I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if that is the blow worth and if I will have people behind me who will put me constantly sticks in the wheels and will express doubts on each of the my actions", explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have all the same told me that I must not renounce because they would also renounce".
"Cest a trust that I can not betray, it says.
What motivates it, one says, is also of continuing the work begun with Hasek.
"For those two last years it has been a great de facto work and I do not want to let it fall".
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in some years and I would not love that somebody stops them., it has declared with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not come back as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it is a thing which Mirek Pelta does not know to make".
"Behind it find himself of the people that fairaient of the football in such a way that it would be only for those that" have been "chosen".
"One can reproach to me for some number of things but surely not of quelq supporter one".
"I endeavor to be objective".
"I want to make football for everyone because everybody will be happy not only those that have been chosen
And it confirms again that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if any that say the opposite, I am ready to make the maximum for Moravia".
"For example, it is the time of envisaging that the second division is divided into two parts the one Czech and the other morave whose winners would find themselves in first division."
"Situation would not be as presently only with three equips moraves in the division because the problem is presently of finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, has entered to the competition for the post of President, Rajchl can not evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I smell permanently a support of the Bedroom Czech that has elected me her Vice -preside and knows that with me succés will be", has declared Rajchl that plans among his succés futures to save tens of millions of crowns on contracts disadvantageous, of the negotiations of contracts with the televisions and on the law on the games.
On the contrary he tells everyone that the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake.
Even though it says about Pelta "that it is disqualified because with it the Czech footblal would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second adversary Paclik is a strong candidate that has of what to offer to the football.
"Nobody can put in doubt to Plzen that it has made this superb year one work".
"If it was taken up it would surely continue in what has been begun by Hasek and would not make change notable among the people in the Commissions."
"He would not want to waste itself his succés"a said Rajchl that has evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming-pools of Europe
A jump in the blue
Of Julia Stanek
Baby pools in optics of flying saucer, magnificent swimming-pools of Budapest: That journey across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having turned the city or made a long walk- can let rest his legs tired in baths of sparkling water.
A watch book in what pool of swimming one can experience the biggest well-being.
When Iris Meder went on journey of research for the 18 last months, there is an object that should not miss in his luggages: his swimsuit.
Spread on his back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam contrary to the marbles Putten that waited for it across of the swimming-pool and did not miss of admiring the art nouveau meticulously restored of these converted swimming-pools.
If a covered swimming-pool made him pleasure, she noticed in his notebook without deadline all the details worthy of interest on the type of building and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming-pools have been probed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and it them have presented in his already published book: "Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath". The municipal covered swimming-pools of Münich, the historical palaces of bath in the black forest, "buildings of concrete Hardcore" in the Taunus.
It has driven his "journeys to the most exceptional baths of the central Europe" to 13 countries. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited respectively places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German of 46 years is a true devotee of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that it does not have a lot of interest as the sport but ell feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that the supporters of the swimming must content with contemplating blue tiles and adapting to the stench of the bleach while the joggers breathe perfume bewitching of the forests of spruce or can listen to chirping of birds cheerful of the park.
"I have wondered a day why the swimming-pools must actually be always so ugly" has said the viennoise one.
"I began therefore a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water reinforces the architecture doubly
A diving in a swimming-pool and the volatile oils of sauna - factor of well-being in the rooms of swimming are enormous because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have worked hard a bit more of grief, the rooms to swim could be a true delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has a surface of water in the rooms of swimming."
"It is transparent from a side, but she reflects the beauty of the very whole building from another side however."
All the surfaces appear optiquement in a way doubles: of the high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The volume of picture of small format "Badefreuden" makes a relation worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and of culture on the oasis of the historical well-being - it gives desire of making a jump in the blue probably.
The collector Meder has discovered remarkable copies during his investigations in Hungary.
Beside the baths of splendid well-beings as the bath Széchenyi aged of 100 years in Budapest, it took on waters containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (bath of cavern in Miskolc-Tapolca) as a bath of thermal baths whose pools are full of water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and being in a building in the form of bottle.
On the other hand, the swimming-pools warmed outdoors of Switzerland and of Austria offer of the spectacular sights. While from a roof of the bath of Zürich one has the whole city at his eyes, one can admire the Arlberg covered with snow from an exterior swimming-pool of St. Anton: The bath Turkish is provided with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Maybe the most extraordinary conception of swimming-pool waits for the swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a FLYING SAUCER that has just landed on Alps.
In winter, steam rises of the three open trays, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal heavenwards.
Alhambra in the black forest
the smell of the bleach does not emanate of all the swimming-pools of the collection Meder.
Numerous thermic baths emanate a smell of sulfur, of the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is difficult to believe, of being in a spa health.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen of carbon that is nearly black and his silt sticks you at the skin as soon as you let yourself slip in the swimming-pool - an experience of special spa.
During his pursuit of the beautiful swimming-pools, Iris Meder also has undergone disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free exterior swimming-pool and outdoors of Czechoslovakia, she has found itself in front of a ground barricaded.
The conceived bath by the architèque Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 meanwhile was closed.
Throwing a glance by the window from the building-Art Nouveau in red-white-yellow, she has observed the blooming of the bad herbs between the tiles.
She has observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming-pool in Black Forest: The palace of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building already has survived three stages; one can discover not only of the neo-roman elements that go out from his conception in 1844 but still a Moorish room in style Alhambra that has been added it in 1900.
For his tidy modernization of 1995, the thermal palace is the favorite bath of the expert in swimming-pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a beautiful yield that of of melting so different styles of building in a so tremendous unity", said Meder.
Apparently, with such a palace, the diving in the thermal swimming-pool is only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in details the speculation on the matter first
Of Christian Teevs
The German bank abandon it her speculation on the raw materials?
According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has assigned a group of work of searching for the consequences of the speculation for the poor ones of the world.
In January, the leader of the group wants to get out afterwards some of the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans find unacceptable that the banks speculate on the raw materials as the corn and the wheat.
Two thirds of the questioned people require even that the German bank and other institutes of credit discontinue this avenue of businesses because it increases the problems of the poorest of the world.
It is the result of an inquiry Forsa on the order of the organization of the consumers Foodwatch.
The study is based itself on a relation presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the speculation of the Stock-Exchanges on the global raw materials, moves the prices upwards and that the banks share a complicity to the world famine.
The campaign of protection of consumers lines up concretely against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the great banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
The speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect the traders from the fluctuations of the prices.
But the majority of experts share meanwhile the opinion that the gamblers have freed from the offers and asks - and take advantage to the expenses of the very poor ones.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no business is worth the trouble to put at stake the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information of the SPIEGEL ONLINE a group of international work examines the accusations of Foodwatch-Report presently.
The examination must be finished of here the end of the year, afterwards the results of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, in a usual way.
Thin January, the leader of the Bank will indicate the consequences to pull.
It a reduction of the market of the raw materials, or well even a complete abandonment could result from it.
Ackermann builds his Picture
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has greeted the news, but at the same time has confirmed his criticisms to the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise of the prices of the food produce shows in a particularly draconian way, to what point the banks of today harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banked lobby to be today under obligation particularly.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the investments from his wallet, for which of the money has been invested on the food" speculations has declared Bode.
"That is little important, for Mister Ackermann, if it is question of the hungry people or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann can seem to first sight amazing, but it is clear that the PDG of the group wishes to present a perfect picture, some months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank has made to announce Monday that the president of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is foreseen within the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve his brand image with an abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, it hardly has to care about it - it will worry his successor.
One on two would cancel the investments on the raw materials.
Foodwatch endeavors to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
Until now more than 30 000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
Bode has published the survey Tuesday, with which on November 7th and 8th the Institute Forsa has carried out questionnaires next to 1001 people.
Just eleven percent have found that legitimate that the Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which of the bets on the prices of the foodstuffs are made.
Numerous customers of the bank would get out some also of the personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such operations: one on two would cancel, with reference to the survey, all the investments for which money is injected in the speculations on the raw materials.
43 percent would advise of such a bank to their environment, 49% have replied that they would think about the termination of their account to change banked establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The House that has moved
Of Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, of the bottoms and one Happy End: the Austrian house for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 has taken away prices, has been a museum in Vienna, has remained empty then has fallen in ruins.
At present it is again opened and serves.
If one is enthusiastic about an architecture of modern post-war period, for his clear forms, his sheds in glass, his lively and bold appearances and his new materials of building that are typical of the belief to the technical progress, then the house of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and celebrates example.
The House of Schwanzer received in the past the "Grand Prix of Architecture" for his building in steel and in glass, light and suspended.
The building is considered until our days as an important stage in the contemporary architecture.
It has made the architects so famous, that he has also built the House for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With his legendary house at four cylinders of BMW and his adjacent building in the form of bowl in Munich, it has finally become famous at the international level in 1973.
His project of house as temporary building had been exposed after the universal exposure in the Switzerland Garden to the station of the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century has opened -
But the building neither physically nor technically was adapted for a museum - not of walls to catch the works of art, therefore not a good environment.
Though as long it has been used, jusqu"à what the contemporary art receives a new edifice in Vienna.
For 2001 the building was empty and has fallen apart more and more.
At present the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the House, it carries now the name of "House of the 21st century" and will be in future used as museum for the contemporary art.
Tuesday night the museum Belvédère has opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck to every viewpoint.
The new departure has been seen through by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who has become the guiding news in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, has upgraded a historian of art to a sizeable career between other in his youth of artistic skater, thereafter by Sotheby's, to the museum Guggenheim and as manager founder of the museum of the modern art of Salzbourg, she has seen through particularly the works of transformation next to the politicians and of the protection of the monuments, it has obtained public funds and private sponsoring and has established the exploitation.
Excepted the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation carries the same name to it have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built.
Strict surveillance, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because it had transformed and had broadened with sensibility the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the competition, but because he had studied to the University technique of Vienna and that for it the house was "an extremely important place" place where he had seen "virtually every weekend" the exhibitions.
It experienced the project of origin, and it experienced the problems of the edifice, which lost in generosity and lightness with reference to his moving to Vienna and throughout his change of use.
During the present transformations, big problems were: l"édifice was "an abyss in energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows of the fronts in glass had changed, isolating glass reinforced in glass fibers was put and the roof replaced with a glass of individual safety.
The girders of the thermic bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made from the place to the new exploitation, a sign of light sifted between the house and the road assures the lighting, a bridge driven to the entry - it is nearly a new building, but always the light House Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origins have remained, the house is painted in a protection shade against the rust of color red-brown.
And the movie theater is even exactly identical to what it was in the past.
And all that under narrow surveillance of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and little expensive had to be found, and that enjoy also to the service of the protection monuments", says Krischanitz and it attracts the attention on a rough ground in basement.
In spite of all the pressures, the problems and the transformations, l"édifice has remained supple and light.
That would have been difficult with the House, "which came from Brussels", has said Krischanitz lately, a typical history of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always at the bad place" and wants to "awaken" despite everything "the good conscience".
But in that case the House of the 21st century is not to the bad place, because if it is a matter of a stroke of luck of urban building: around the Switzerland Garden rises up precisely the "area of the central station" very recently foreseen, with offices and apartments.
And maybe another stroke of luck is going to happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the help of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the center of berlinois temporary art, and as it is said, she negotiates already with the city in order to obtain a site in the neighborhood from the Switzerland Garden.
Bahn plans a crisis package of winter in millions.
The society of the railroads has elaborated a plan-crisis, which aims at avoiding the accidents of train in winter.
The number of wage earners should double.
That costs millions.
In the fighting against the accidents of train related to the season of winter and the delays, the society of the railroads "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional to this consideration this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung has brought back beforehand invoking an internal plan-crisis to the group, which investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be foreseen up to in 2015.
That should allow a better availability of the vehicles and of the railway network also in the case of extreme bad weather.
The number of internal and external wage earners for the snow-clearing of the railroad installations and of the quays would owe between other to double and to pass to 16,000 people.
The objective is of clearing the quays of the snow and of the ice up to at the beginning of the stage on duty and 90 percent of the devices of sees essentials to the service in a deadline of four to five hours.
Two months ago the Station Master Rüdiger Grube has warned the government and the industry during a conference at the summit of the accidents of trains occurred also this winter.
Last winter the society of the railroads has had enormously of problems for the transport of users, because it misses between other of reserves in the event of difficult meteorological conditions.
It is as numerous new regional trains wait for years an authorization on behalf of the Ministry of the railroads.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of trains ICE.
The society of railroad has for years of what to make, given that it must make the axles of the trains ICE verify clearly more often to the workroom, after a breaking off of axles has taken place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the business of the leader Josef Ackermann it is of the new one in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine s"élevant at millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector catches it besides in the US: the institute of Frankfurt pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a disagreement because of the bankruptcy of five great cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is a matter of the sale of documents of mortgage.
The regulator of the stock markets NCUA carries to the great banks a whole series of accusations, and it of having to incite to the cooperative banks to make fake promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost enormously of value in the course of the financial crisis and have taken the banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied, of having been able to find a solution on that subject, without the parts start a procedure to the court", has said an interlocutor of the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not recognized any mistake in comparison.
That is valid also for the Citigroup, who has committed to a payment of an amount of 20,5 million dollars.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz has received the concessions of the two banked establishments.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for the cooperative banks of the US and it intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits from customers.
The NCUA tries to make up for the incurred damages of several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulator has as seized by other great banks to part and in summer he has allocated in front of the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In what concerns the question of the documents of mortgage it is a matter of "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The houses of credit are at the base.
While the American property bubble has burst into 2007, This has been fatal for a great number of banked societies.
In September 2008, to the summit of the financial crisis, the bank of investment of the US Lehman Brothers has foundered.
Even if the events date back already to some years, at the present time he blows a wind of storm on the American banks.
The investors and the authorities of surveillance have brought numerous resort to obtain repairing or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has started the greatest wave of complaints.
It reproaches to 18 for great international banks, to the two financiers of that property American d"état Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of s"être favored in kind during businesses of mortgages of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank must also put down a resort to the FHFA, it is here a matter of several operations of a total amount of 14,2 billion dollars for the years 2005 to 2007.
The authorities of surveillance ask, that the Frankfurter answers for the "substantial losses" but however without quoting a sum clarifies.
The Deutsche Bank had thrown back the requests as being unjustified and declares to want to defend oneself.
WARREN Buffett increases in 10 billion by IBM
Buffett, the guru of the finance, invests colossal sums in the firm TI of IBM.
Since March, he has bought actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
So far the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in computer firms TI, considering that l"évolution in the long term of the societies let only bad forecasts appear.
It has read the relations of IBM though and has changed his opinion about the investments in this sector.
It had already of the to understand much earlier than IBM proposes especially benefits of services and computer systems for the sectors TI of other firms.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as an attack of knight in the world of the finance.
Consequently the activity TI IBM is granted itself the right to be called at present "IBM mister".
Because Buffett has revealed today CNBC to economic l"émission, that he has bought since March actions IBM of a value of 10,7 billion dollars.
His holding company society of investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a big shareholder of IBM with a part of 5.5 percent.
Buffett has said that IBM anything has not known ever of this commitment so far.
He has congratulated the direction, which even during the economic crisis had assured reasonable profits.
"You have made a super work", has said Buffett strategically.
IBM bets for some time on the lucrative services TI as exploitation of the accounting centers.
The pioneer of the computing, old person of more than 100 years, offers as well Software and consultation as of the very efficient computers of firm.
Buffett had until now rather avoided the firms of technology.
He says that it invests only in the firms whose businesses it includes.
But on the contrary Buffett attacks rather the railroad frêt, to manufacturers of lubricants or of machines.
Her Holding Company Berkshire Hathaway possesses close to 80 subsidiaries as of the parts next to a whole series of great groups as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the munichois ex Rück.
This octogenarian of 81 years had recovered in the years 60" the small firm of textile Berkshire Hathaway and had erected it to the row of one of the most prestigious world firms, thanks to intelligent investments.
Though his way of life is modest.
It is for that that it is a cult face for numerous investors of the whole world.
His nearly infallible sense to earn money has been it worth the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the investment of Buffett the actions IBM have increased of one percent to the grant.
"Big Blue", such than is called also IBM, has a scholarship holder value of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and reckons with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious firms of technology to the world.
By Microsoft, said Buffett, he does not want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" the Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper talks even about a "bloody ideology", which would re-arise at present.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and of a small Greek firm in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
With reference to this news, Turkey as the population germano-turque reacts with fear and anxiety.
Because for a lot of germano-turcs the ghost that one believed death for long redoes his appearance: from the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and to Solingen in May 1993, there has not been anymore comparable violence with this extremist context of right against the Turks.
That a xenophobia is in Germany, never it has been nevertheless question.
The extremist network of right that has been detected reveals though proportions whose dimension is far from being predictable.
"It is a return to the bloody ideology, Such a was the title of the publication on internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand the newspaper "Sabah" underlines that one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the mess of extreme right wing.
It is in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany has reacted: she has called this weekend to a commemoration silencer to the victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg.
It is not that two weeks beforehand only the Turkish community of Berlin and the German and Turkish political ones had thought about a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the germano-turc agreement of recruitment.
It is with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been directed, symbolizing a history of success.
The relations of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "the present of Germany for the fiftieth birthday" such a is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", who refers to the context of the series of murders.
So the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not hold back of getting out some of the univocal conditions.
"that starts stinking", Such a is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It underlines that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have brought an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The action of the police has been perceived in a very critical way on the germano-turcs forums and these had thereafter discussed the success of their investigations.
 Why already it has not come much more early to the mind of the German authorities of making investigations in some environments suspects of extreme right, are surprised the authors.
More than one appears ready at least to rhetorical indeed drastic means: "If the business continues be botched, it will not be left to the migrants nothing else than the self-defense and the armament".
"that will be well the best self-defense".
"The inner peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of the information and on the pertinence of the punishment of the unity of the network", writes "Selen".
What that means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the years 90 well have explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown no more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, who the mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could lead on to.
The attacks though have sharpened the feeling of the us in the Turkish community.
Never repeating the mistakes of the past
In the past it is especially the failure of the German policy after the attacks whose Turkish press has complained: Helmut Kohl has refused to visit to the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen it has sent a telegram of condolences to the Leader of the Turkish State, has made to represent to the obsequies in Cologne by his Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel Minister of Foreign Affairs counted at that time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population caused.
As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the amount of his tax burdens.
The present relation of the Turkish media shows a time furthermore how much the mistrust of a lot of Germano-turcs is deep to l"état of local right for this date.
Beside the efforts of a roomier clarification and revaluation of the terrorism of extreme right wing in Germany, a clear message is this time essentials.
The bank to scandal of the lake of Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has made nearly bankruptcy in the crisis financier and patina meanwhile of a crisis to the other one.
It is a German that must lead now.
It is not probably it that Axel Weber imagined s"était.
After his spectacular departure of the head of the Bundesbank; one has had knowledge in July, which it would occupy in 2013 a nearly as spectacular post: President of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a great step to an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly looked forward, has greeted; Switzerland for his beauty and the UBS for his lately obtained solidity and has made to pass kind observations on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has completed the Turnaround".
"I look forward to the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And nevertheless, from the month of September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A trader of titles of UBS in London had diverted all the systems of safety from the Bank and had burned about 1.7 billions of euros.
The leader of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a pretty well known banker not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.
of the President of the board of directors of the UBS is considered for as unwell - and everyone ask: When finally does Axel Weber come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be recommended from the bank from February 2012.
And it will recover the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank has communicated it Tuesday.
For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more teacher d"économie and President of the bank, and probably it would have needed a period of adaptation.
Only of one blow he accepts then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved still a time more that it has for long deserved the title of "the greatest bank to scandal of Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is of an enormous side - up to lately, it was the biggest administrator of active of the world, and of the other one, it skates for years of a scandal to the other one.
Nothing, it seems, does not spare the so proud Swiss bank.
That has begun during the financial crisis.
Up to in 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The picture of the Swiss administrator of active, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she wanted also evolution, in the domain of the banked investment, a very great bank.
Therefore the UBS managed of a side in 2007 with 1.6 billions of dollars more money coming from some easy customers than every other bank to the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as bank of investment in the league of the greatest banks of the world.
That has made an impression.
The previous banker Hans Geiger and later teacher of bank for long years to Zurich tells: "I have always taken the UBS as model of good bank in front of my students."
In the present optics, one wonders: how quite simply I would have been able to make a mistake to this point"?
He has deeply made a mistake.
In 2007 it has appeared that for the first time something did not turn round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year the president Peter Wuffli has withdrawn from amazing way, which was considered so far as an intellectual top as an inspired banker.
Some months later one has sensed for what reasons it had left.
The division of the bank had burned with documents sub-prime and has of the to make a cross on billions.
To support that, the UBS has announced an increase of capital of an amount of 13 billion francs and has made a cross top.
For that indeed she has found investors, but that, little time before, would have frowned: a bottom of non-transparent Asian state coming from Singapore and a bottom of Arabic state, which had passed under silence, so much so that one has even never learned his name.
That n"était nevertheless that the first blow.
In April 2008 that is worsened itself.
The bank had to announce again losses being encoded at billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, which was still the second board of directors the one better paid from Switzerland in 2006, retired.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS found itself financial, considering his mistakes of investment, in the crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State.
The national bank has purchased tens of billions of problematic titles to the UBS, Swiss Confederation has considered six billion francs as obligations convertible into actions, for which she could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland has been shaken - because she has noticed to what point that can be dramatic for a small country, of sheltering so great banks.
Finally, the total of the assessment of the UBS 2007 s"éleva at more than five times the economic performances of Switzerland (to see graphic).
"We have not been able to save the UBS still a time", called the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster it has followed itself of the second.
Already some months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a fiscal disagreement with America and has declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customers, which maybe had defrauded the tax department with the help of the Bank.
Moreover, she has accepted a payment of 780 million dollars - in repayment of unjustified profits coming from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published than it had helped in the tax fiddle.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been his capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss bank confidentiality has not been the same one anymore.
It followed itself of the withdrawal of the leader of the board of directors and of the president of the board of directors.
And of the exodus of the money of the customers.
Thus the bank had lost in some months his credibility in the two main sectors of business: the banked investment because of bad speculations and the management of active because of the help to the tax fiddle.
And, as it was about little one return to the quietness, and as one thought it, that the UBS would put through, it followed itself of this unfortunate history of traders of title: only one trader of title flames 1.7 billions of euros, before the bank notices that something did not turn round.
And one publishes: with the management of the risks in bank of investment that does not seem always to work.
"With the case Adoboli, one has been able to notice that masters it of the risks to too little changed", said Martin Janssen, economist and teacher of the finances to the banked Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the chief financial officer of a great German bank is sure: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have the mastery of the risks in hand."
However it was exactly a matter of the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had for long taken their duty, that of guard evolution of the great fortune of the world: not de trop great risks, but the safety for the money - and the world well could collapse beyond the alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of a steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are it for a particularly noble chocolate.
The central one of the UBS to Zurich goes still hand in hand with the plated solid of the Swiss bank private - it is only a bit bigger.
Already the situation is classical.
The Bank is based to the central station of Zurich, which drives directly of the central station to the lake of Zurich, that himself is surrounded by the summits covered with snow of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of stores depict more among the ones raised from Europe.
The jewellers as Tiffany's, one finds them here between the stores of Swiss traditions everything as those of the sweetshop Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: of the national bank passing by the palace of the Switzerland Credit up to banks deprived elitists as Julius Bär.
One arrives to the hall of entry of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are dressed in marble, in front find themselves of thick chairs of leather, and beside the logo of the bank, a great label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer searches for here: the safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has sometime écarté of the market - or betrayed the two great Swiss banks, the UBS and the Switzerland Credit, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank finds.
Him préfèrerait not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all the Swiss bankers it is businesses also with the two great banks.
The UBS would have become well too big, trouve-t'il - especially in the banked investment, where moreover the Anglo-Saxons would have spread.
The Swiss would not have anything more as it to statement.
"And when well even, they are themselves for long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
That has been indeed the Anglo-Saxon bank of investment that has changed the UBS, it has made high profits and afterwards thaws it: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-prime as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster has become obvious on October 15th, 2008.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country at the seven million inhabitants has started the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation ", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs about, is 45 billion euros, the politicians have accepted to rescue the great bank from the bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three great Swiss banks have concluded an enormous group together.
A bank has been created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and has recorded constantly an increase.
What has helped, it is that the two prédécesseuses banks different from the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong point the management of active to Zurich and a poorer, but indeed already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, the international banks of investment have had favorably access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn an enormous wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 Leader of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, in the past president of the board of directors.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a team of dream", called the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, that knows very well in modèles and statistical, and Ospel, the intuitive one, who has cleared a path for itself up to the summit with the apprenticeship of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted jusqu"à the end to Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have committed in the end a decisive mistake: "He thought that his models were the reality", says Geiger.
"It is a tragic fall."
Tragedy, maybe.
A thing is clear: the exuberance has happened before the fall.
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly the meetings of the leaders in the course of whom the leader of the group Wuffli has always pronounced the same watchword: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful bank of investment of the planet.
It has commanded the "League Tables" the classifications, which have documented at this time the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to go up very above.
Some stages have already succeeded it.
In business of currencies and of transactions of movable values she has played a very important role.
The advisers of firm, who have had the responsibility, have underlined though a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the banked gibberish "Fixed Income", would be an enormous difference in relation to the greatest banks.
The UBS would have gaps at the level of the American products of mortgages.
To fill in this gap, the UBS is itself threw in an adventure, who nearly has cost him the life.
Thirsty of growth, they are the bank itself as well as a bottom of management created before it in the investments sub-prime American that have invested.
It has transformed into a massive machine that has packed and makes to pass the documents of value based on the hypothecary loans American - but that has also preserved of the risks.
Even while other banks tried for long to go down.
"Still in the process of the summer 2007, even though the market of the American one property was in flames, the UBS has bought there", said Geiger, the banked expert.
The bigger the euphory is the more brutal the fall is.
A manager after the other one has had to leave, while to put a term to the attempts has proved more difficult than one thought.
Posts by UBS have become éjectables and are until now bancaux.
The one that leads the great bank has an almost impossible task.
It must take on a strategy for a bank, for whom all the models of firm suggested have disappeared.
The researcher of bank, Geiger has already an idea: putting a term at the bank of investment, concentration to the management of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want (still) also to go far.
But the bank of investment must atrophy sturdily, as far as that is clear present jusqu"à.
Next Thursday the leader of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The Italo-Swiss aged of 51 years was only supposed to be transitory to title while the bank has separated itself from his predecessor Grübel with surprise.
Meanwhile, he has dominated: it must lead lastingly the businesses of the UBS, has communicated Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring back the bank of investment at the state of promotion of the environment of the years 1990.
He cancels 3500 jobs.
But that will not suffice.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who it is?
With what does she want to earn money?
It is the questions that Axel Weber is already itself probably put.
He says publicly only that he was going to look with his woman for an apartment at Zurich until now.
Next year.

The intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered as "problem of birds °" but the experts maintain that these very intelligent animals do not let themselves hunt anymore of the cities for long.
Some love them, some others want to dispose itself some of them also in a fast way that possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in numerous communities the complaints of the residents multiply because of the dirt and of the noise of the animals.
An antidote against the "°problème of birds" is not still in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on the crows, the experts have said that it is not no more possible to hunt the rooks from the cities.
The experts of the whole Germany has discussed the possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
The protectors of the nature based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of the chemicals in the agriculture destroys more and more the traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, the conversion and the slaughter of typical trees of incubation gave back the birds the difficult life.
The crows are under the protection of the nature.
There are great colonies with more than 600 couples of incubation in the westfälischen Soest, in the north-west among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim close to Bremen as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements because of the massacre of the crows in this region.
The criticisms have taken on the capture of the birds in traps and their killings with clubs particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the évincement, does not serve to anything", has noticed the planner of the city and of the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests with the aid of the water under pressure or to destroy well the trees, produced often of the undesirable consequences, has told the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser of Lahr to the Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the great colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
L"évincement is conceivable only in the exceptional cases as in the hospitals, the old people's homes or the schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can not exterminate them anymore."
The problem does not let itself solve in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the évincement of the animals to an aversif conditioning and of the tenacious offers, in order to allow them of reinstalling itself elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "signs of info instead of chain saws" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "Better we can bear finally a button to the the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens has co-founded the Ascheberger-progression-educational of the baskets in the Schleswig-Holstein, of the road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent rooks.
This project has meanwhile been adopted by the tourists.
Jürgen has given his own opinion about the criticism with regard to the noise caused by the birds: "This is a great number of communication, those birds have a lot to tell to itself".
The intelligence and the skilfulness of the animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only instruments of work to arrive to a delight but they produce themselves their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists of the university of Cambridge tested four rooks lately, to what point the intelligence of the birds happens.
In an experience, the birds learned in a fast way that they had to make to collapse a scaffolding with stones to reach thus a larva.
Without a lot of training, they recognized déterminément that a stone had to have some thickness and form to make the platform knock down.
In a second testing, the shrewd crows had to solve a squatter problem afterwards.
In a cylinder put vertically, the researchers had put a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beak.
Though, the researchers had put pieces of wire to their arrangement.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four rooks one succeeds even from the beginning.

The slaughter of staff mass
The new book of Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The beauty and the sorrow: a personal history of the First World War), it begins by a long list of characters that grips you the heart.
An advice to begin: tear this page tidily and make some your bookmark.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in the course of these few moments that, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and despaired in the mists of the war.
Peter Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the price Nobel of literature.
It has written here a book out of the common one that it describes, with exactitude, as "a work of anti-history."
It comprises some well known names, of the important treaties or of the famous battles; one does not find presqu no ambassador nor discussion on the strategies and the material.
It is not so much a book on what he has passed to itself, it explains, only a "describing book" that "that could look" like. One finds the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and the sorrow" summarizes the experiences in time of war of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, of the two sides of the war, of young schoolboys and botanists to escaladeurs, going by by the doctors, ambulance drivers and salesmen.
Some will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become mad or will lose the life.
Their lives stagger here as the candles of a church: even though some switch off, one relights some of new.
The book of Peter Englund moves away from the traditional books of history.
It brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War amounts only by the terrible war of the trenches on the western forehead.
"The beauty and the sorrow" described skillfully from other theaters of war: Alps, the Balkans, the eastern forehead, Mesopotamia and the eastern Africa.
The present soldiers in this book are under hives; one pass Noël in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an inflexible problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such a natural, such disaster a hurricane Katrina that stinks of the cordite.
While blows of cannon ring in the distance, and that you are a mother at the home, do you stay or do you run away?
Who will come anyway?
Nearly nobody can understand what he has passed to itself, or even the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, permanent ideas, conspirationnistes theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English babysitter within the Russian army, as Richard Stumpf, a sea teenager of the fleet of high German sea.
Their histories are principally long treks of dissertations, of letters and of other already published documents.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most protected thanks to the accumulation from small moments and from isolated details.
The majority approach the deprivation and the capacity for putting through.
Telling the history of a German schoolboy, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
"Coffee of substitution, fake aluminum, imitation of rubber, bandages in paper, buttons in wood."
He continues on the food of substitution in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in fat of sheep (and finished with a fake bone of wood); the tobacco produced with dry roots and skin dried from potato; soles of shoes in wood."
He maintains that "837 authorized meats of substitution are recorded in the production of sausages. One finds also 511 coffees of substitution."
Some histories approach the honor and the courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse to the savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is it to what the men were intended, rather than of to sit itself in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best seller, both rather only of claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is not any barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt.
In an opposite way, a British soldier realizes that it risks strong of dying, and that nobody will notice it or will not pay attention to it.
"While one is resigned to sacrifice itself, one hopes to have a" written "public"-him.
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and of new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition" written Peter Englund, "a war between the factories."
He seizes the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass pretty articulate and convinced ideologically, in clothes well cut, who carries out his butcher's shop all being sat behind a counter."
The people act in an unexpected way; one finds as many behaviors of base as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal illness by prostitutes in order to avoid the service au front.
"One finds the expression the most ludicrous in the business of could owed to the gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and s"étalent on the genitals in the hope to finish to the hospital", writes.
"The most desperate apply it on the eyes, what is translated by a blindness for life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is supple but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In tens of short scenes, it seizes the way whose war has "started exclusively unverifiable strengths: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for the religion. "
The people start wondering why their leaders make them a war.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The great war and the modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or "Westwards nothing again", of Erich Maria Remarque, rather that complete.
The work of Peter Englund is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictionnelle work.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if it had arisen of his book, seized of your hands this page where the list of people and burned with a match appears.
After a first fake step, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been implied, some carrying helmets antiriot.
The night from Monday to Tuesday has been chosen because the park Zuccotti would be emptiest.
The operation has remained secret of everyone except for of some officers top placed as of others informed from the beginning that they were going to conduct an exercise.
The commissioner of Police Raymond W. Kelly was found itself to the heart of the operation, his presence underlining the risks and the challenges for the department of Police.
There could not be repetitions d"épisodes these last weeks, as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who have gone against the regulations of the department and have generated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation aiming at cleaning the park Zuccotti of his demonstrators has been deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The policemen s"étaient prepared observing the progress of the occupations in other cities.
A major exercise has been organized on l"île of Randall, with a view to the operation at the park Zuccotti.
The police officers receive a better training against the riots - of the anti-terrorist measures that consist in moving a great number of policemen rapidly - to concentrate on the area of Lower Manhattan.
The last session of training has taken place Monday night, of the side of Manhattan de l'East River.
The orders given to move in the park have managed last minute, has declared an accustomed, referring to the operation as to "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen that I know and who have been called did not know that they would go to the park Zuccotti", has declared the person under anonymity.
"The only ones that is to say that they would go there are to the summit of the hierarchy of the department of Police."
The city has known to keep a lesson, of where the secret of the operation.
On last October 14th, policemen wanted to clean the park but have made to reject by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
The operation of Tuesday implied officers of diverse unity of Police, of which of the operational strengths of the whole area - of the tens of officers accustomed to the areas particularly criminal.
M. Kelly has declared that many people went and came to the park for the day, to the way of migrants. An hour of the morning was therefore a propitious timetable.
"He admitted to proceeding while the park counted the least people" it has asserted.
Of the vehicles of the services of urgency equipped with spots and of speakers have gathered itself on Underwear Pipe and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, close to the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resounding with the speakers have seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
Even though the officers to the community businesses came to the park equipped with their coupe-vent blue light, numerous demonstrators simply have gathered their businesses and have left.
No tent has been touched before 1h45 has declared the Police, it that has left the time to the occupants of gathering their businesses.
Other teams of policemen have been seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests proved necessary.
Present journalists inside the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the leader of the department of Police, has maintained that this measure had been taken uniquely by safety.
But according to numerous journalists, the Police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly kept by the officers.
M. Browne has declared that the present trucks of cameras of television on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were in measure of capturing pictures.
Even though the Police moved to the west crossing the thick jumble of businesses of the demonstrators, including the luggages, the lawn in plastic and the bags of leaves filled with clothes, teams of the department of the decontamination followed, cleaning all what the occupants left behind them.
The few demonstrators who have refused to leave have been dragged. The pictures have been broadcast on Internet little time after.
The main group of demonstrators has taken place close to the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a fence that the Police have moved to stop methodically.
Ten people feeling to the epicenter of the camp have clung together.
Finally, two people have chained up themselves to trees, has declared Mr. Kelly.
The services of urgency have been called to cut the padlocks.
No arrest has taken place in the park before 3h30 has asserted Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the operation of cleanup has ended about an hour and quarter more late.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people have been stopped in the park.
the majority for "confusion to the public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, leader of the department of Police, is the officer the more gradé to s"être taken on on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, the leader of the department of the detectives, was also present.
M. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations" has declared Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen waited along the side is of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the event of intervention essentials.
Barricades have been put on Cortlandt Street, a city block to the north of the park, as on Pine Street, southwards.
One has seen the Police broaden the perimeter well beyond the park Zuccotti.
Several officers, the majority equipped with shields, even would have been seen at moving people to move them away.
Nearly 28 people found themselves north from the side.
One of the actions the more weevers of the night has place taken to the south of the park.
To 5h00, to the south of Prick Street, a demonstrator has jumped on the great-coat of a police car. Others have been seen at bursting the tires of a truck of Police.
At a moment, an end of plywood has arisen flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator have been hospitalized.
The union of the school aids prosecutes the city for dismissals
The union that represents hundreds of school aids having lost their job last month foresees of bringing Wednesday a trial to the city for useless and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportioned on the schools receiving disadvantaged schoolboys.
The pursuits are the ultimate weapon of the union, Advice of the 37th District, probably to try to make the dismissals cancel.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aids, coordinators of parents and other employees, being part of the ones less well paid from the city, have lost their job on last October 7th. The union leaders have compared these dismissals with a political revenge not to have let the city reach a bottom for care of health led by the groups of workers, and who would have allowed closing the gap of budget at the last spring.
The municipal authorities have denied categorically this accusation.
During an audience of the Town Council last month, the chancellor Dennis M. Walcott has declared that the dismissals constituted a part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Advice has riposted, mentioning that the dismissals of the school aids n"étaient in no way specified in the budget.
The officers of the Advice of the 37th District have declared that they would fill an opinion with complaint, warning the department of the education of his being pursued; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to announce officially the judicial pursuits at the High Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the department of l"éducation of the city will constitute the defendant part. The plaintiffs will be represented with eight dismissed workers, all of latino-américaines black color or origin, as most of the school aids that have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the legal department of the city, has declared that the municipality has yet not been able to see the reasons of the trial and can not make therefore comments on the allegations.
According to an outline of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would bet the most discriminated against of the city to support his complaint against an inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the most aids because of a regular under-financing, on the number of dismissals in the schools of the areas.
While one does not count any dismissal on Staten Island, and some hardly in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aids have lost their job in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the areas south of the Bronx.
Noticing the loss of five school aids on eight employees to the state school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of the schoolboys live in the poverty, the pursuits assert that "it Is not an area of easy parents that can take funds to fill in the budget lack."
The budget of public l"école 36 has been reduced of 3,26% this year. Funds have also been lost while the city has changed his calculation from the disadvantaged additional financing for every registration d"élève.
The union asserts also that the managers of secondary schools have can to be led in mistake by some terms in a mémo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The mémo used the term "overtaking" to describe the action, "overtaking" described more generally the action of moving a teacher of a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the project of complaints, sixty-six coordinators of parents have been dismissed, and "not only for cause of overtaking".
Downright mission: the Conference takes on an agreement on the question of Libya
It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats have found an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Lybie.
A successful uprising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long date Muammar Kadhafi as the American involvement will have been needed.
The committee of the foreign relationships of the Senate will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by the President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with the senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution consists to honor the courage of the Libyans even though they start reconstructing their country" has declared John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language is maybe inoffensive but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, legislators of the two parties have gone in conflict, as with the White House, on the expression of several resolutions aiming at approving or not the military role of the United States in the mission of the NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have presented a resolution aiming at authorizing the limited job of American military strengths in Libya.
The bill has been defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and has never been the subject to a vote to the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the bill, Parliament has also thrown back a measure aiming at reducing the financing of the American operations to Libya.
The American mission therefore has remained under a form of legislative purgatory - the Conference sufficiently annoyed to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut it the grass under the foot.
The indecision of the Conference has been exceeded by the events.
Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi has been killed on last October 20th.
The mission of the NATO has officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate can at present to act.
The resolution of the Committee of the foreign relationships "congratulates the Libyan people for his "extraordinary" courage and determination with a view to the freedom" and "congratulates the men and women" of the American armed forces and their partners of the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution asserts also "the national interest of the United States to get to a transition irreversible and succeeded to the democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure take away all the support of the Commission of the foreign businesses of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as in last June?
The senator and president of the Commission Moneybags D. Lugar (Independent) is itself opposite to the last version.
His spokesperson has declared project last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the very last version again.
Within the Capitol, the Bedroom must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority nearly for all the Republicans of the Conference, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bobsleigh Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relative to the budget, or every other question, to obtain from floor to the Bedroom or to the Senate a vote.
Other legislators do not have so far not succeeded to make their amendments approve but it is not without having tried.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been presented to the Conference, on a broad fan of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed at the same time to the Bedroom and to the Senate - and others are light variations of a precedent.
One counts at least 15 versions to the Bedroom uniquely of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that "would control the federal expenses".
Some of these bills are identical, but give to their supports - notably the new Republicans that wish to gild their CV - the luck of priding oneself on being "the author" of such a measure.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in last August asked the vote of the Bedroom and of the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators one voted in favor of a not constraining resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Conference can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a lot of amendments guaranteeing the right to an education of quality and to the care of health, among other subjects.
An amendment forbidding the marriage among individuals of same sex is perpetually proposed, all as the amendment forbidding the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators wish to authorize also the annulation of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed to it.
Also eager that have been the members of offering amendments, they are not so fast as by the past.
During the 111th Conference, the legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 during the 110th.
The rhythm slows down by relation at the beginning of the years 1990, while the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers supplied by the library of the Senate.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have some today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - has been ratified in 1992 but he has been proposed to the Conference in 1789.
"Slaughtered but not beat" asserts Gabrielle Giffords during his first meeting televised for the shooting
Ten months after an armed man has pulled it top at point-blank range to Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) has appeared Monday night in a televised emission, has sung "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and has declared to want rather to recover above all that to return to the Conference.
During his appearance to the television news "20/20" on the ABC chain, to the side of Reveille Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has fought to form sentences and needed help to walk.
L"émission has approached his difficult return with reference to the ball that has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, it had made the text relative to the ceiling of the debt a return surprising in the House of Representatives to vote.
During his first meeting televised for the shooting of January, which has killed six people and hurt thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords has smiled, laughed and sung - and described his restoration of "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer has asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, has replied "rather well".
The meeting with Gabrielle Giffords and his husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, has taken place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", diffused the eve of the exit of the new book of the titled couple "Gabby: a history of courage and of hope".
Special L"émission has related the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords for the shooting of January 8th.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, one sees it on his bed of hospital, the shaven head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She manages to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragements of his husband.
Some months more late, Gabrielle Giffords is sat in a wheelchair even though the doctors teach him to carry out simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "Which".
Some days more late, Gabrielle Giffords has whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu from his small breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of the music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: one sees the Representative at singing the air of Cyndi Lauper with the doctors "Chorus girls Wanna Cuts Fun" and of Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
During the meeting with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with the doctors, has declared not to remember the shooting.
According to his husband, it was reading it an article on the shooting of March 12th while it has stopped it and asked for the first time for information on the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison of Missouri and sturdily treated waiting for the trial.
"There have been many deaths" has declared Gabrielle Giffords in Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his restoration, has declared Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, it has said "I have been beaten."
"Therefore I would say," Gabby, "you have not been beaten", has asserted Mark Kelly.
You have fair summer slaughtered.
And you are going to put through, restore yourself and come back still more strong that never.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to gather millions of dollars for the veterans without home of the city of New York.
Kid Rock has sung a ballad on the impotence, the frustration and the loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Sailors around it.
The crowd in suit-tie has put itself standing at his feet to acclaim it.
"The servicemen, men and women, heroes are considered", has declared David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of fund of the spring.
A military haut-gradé present at the gala, which also the admiral Mike Mullen participated in, leader d"état-major of the armies of the United States, has seen the role of the troops in a different way.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan", has written the military haut-gradé in an e-mail.
I am sure about the organizers having good intentions.
I know it.
But this n"était not of the respect. Just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the servicemen and a passionate American public but often distant.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have some price, declare some servicemen.
The public acts more and more as if he was distressed for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims" has declared the general sergeant Sean B. MacFarland, who has directed the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way of supporting us is of closing us in in the role of unlucky minds."
It is a matter of a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, which do not wish to seem not grateful or in disagreement with the public that they serve.
They realize that the anger of the troops coming back from the war of the Vietnam has been well worse also.
Thus, most of the conversations on the pity take place in every confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons of the fighting with the Navies, the colonel reprocessed Mark Cancian has warned them of the public considering their service under two perspectives.
Some would concern them with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and have traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "a veteran in anger and violent hides under the surface" has declared Cancian, which has fought in Iraq and has come back to work to the Government in Washington.
While it searched for a job, it has declared, it felt what any people that made to him to pass the maintenances asked in a subtle way if it would be capable to keep the blow under the stress of a job requiring his return of the fighting in Washington immédiatement après.
"While you approach the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions", remind the colonel Cancian while he talks to his sons.
The difficulties of the servicemen arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
The victories are seldom congratulated by an as little familiar country with the army and who sees few direct advantages of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
"As nation, we do not value anymore the heroism in the same way as for the Second World War" declare the general lieutenant reprocessed David Barno, who has directed the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead of that, the congratulations of the politicians and of the people largely concentrate on the depth of the sufferings of a serviceman.
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of services endured, the number of lost friends or the area of the injuries.
The army in view of the increasing pressure of raging against the rapists
This week, a major audience will decide if 28 men and women will go in trial against the army for an inactivity required regarding rapes.
In this case, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the neighbor.
The soldier of 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was aged of 25 years and pregnant with 11 weeks the night where she maintains to have been raped by a soldier.
C"était in October 2008. It fit at his barracks in Miramar Air Station, to the north of San Diego, after having dined with a friend, while it has met a colleague transporting a pack of beers.
He has asked him if it could join it in his bedroom to drink a glass.
"C"était an alarm signal" declares Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has left aside his anxiety.
I have thought: not, it has 19 years.
"It is of Texas" it says.
"I will have had to follow my intuition."
Some minutes after having entered to the bedroom of Elizabeth Lyman, the man has caught it by behind, thrown by earth and violated, it claims.
This week, on November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 others military, certain still in operation and of others not, will wait with anxiety for the decision of justice during a historical trial that will take place to Arlington, in Virginia, and that will decide if a trial carried against the previous secretary to the defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are marked of not having stopped the generalization of the rapes within the army, going thus contrary to the constitutional laws of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, the trial implied to the departure 17 plaintiffs. This number has risen at 28 the next months - 25 women and 3 men, everyone claiming to have been raped or to have been deceived sexually by soldier colleagues. They claim also that the army has not held an inquiry, hounded nor supplied with justice adapted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares to blame the servicemen trimmed, because the problem begins by them.
"The army is a vertical structure" suggests.
"Who are the individuals in position d"éradiquer the culture of retaliations? The leaders."
The lawyer declares also that since the month of February, she has been contacted nearly by 400 other survivors, of which the majority can to be part of judicial future pursuits.
His strategy: instead of rallying all the plaintiffs in this business - putting thus all his eggs in the same basket - it will bring several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The team of the defense, for the Department of the Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has put down a motion to throw back the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defense, and mainly the fact that the army can not be pursued by soldiers in operation or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the High Court, named the Doctrine Feres, the federal Government is not a person in charge of injuries undergone by the staff in operation active.
"The alleged harm is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs" indicate the documents.
The department of the Defense has refused to make every comment.
The things have changed for the years 50.
Even though the women do not have always the right to go to the fighting, officially, this distinction is noted down only on paper: the lines head-on recent wars are seldom uniquely male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers play a more and more important role, to get with the local women in contact notably.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost the life - two thirds in situation of fighting.
It is time for the army of modernizing itself declares Susan Burke.
It is not alone to lead this fighting: three other trials are in process on top of hers.
To l"école of right of Yale, the center of legal services of the veterans prepares a business against the four main military academies to have so-called to encourage a misogynous atmosphere.
On the other hand, the foundation to not lucrative goal Vietnam Veterans of America prepares one trial against the army, concentrating on the diagnoses of "confusion of the personality" attributed to the victims of the rapes in order to dismiss them - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women sec Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for the human rights.
His group has started proceedings in December to the Administration of the Veterans, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way of treating the requests of advantages for the people declaring to have been victims of a sexual agression in the service.
Nine independent bills ones of the others have been presented to the Conference by a mixture bipartisan of senators and representatives, proposing diverse solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 agressions sexual have been recorded according to the center of intervention and of prevention of the agressions sexual (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the department of the defense.
But well it is known that numbers it of agressions sexual is underestimated. Indeed, according to the own appraisal of the Pentagon, this number represents about 13,5% of the 19.000 incidents occurred that year.
The relation seemed in March studies also the percentage of judicial pursuits: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army have been the subject to a trial - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The plaintiffs of the business of Susan Burke describe their agression as the first of a series of traumas.
In the business of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of the rape less than one hour after the facts.
Tonight it says, one has asked to him to tell 11 times in details his rape to different policemen, doctors and majors.
It has undergone a "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of his aggressor - owed to a break to his arm - has been found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sat in front of a judge, to a trial in the course of which one questions it about his sexual relationships with his boyfriend earlier the day of his agression.
Six people have testified as character references for the author of the crime, which has ended up being settled.
"I remember of the day where the verdict" has been given back declares Elizabeth Lyman.
"I have believed that I was going to start having contractions. I have started to cry after the court."
"I have been put in psychiatric unity, and while I have gone out, I remember to have told to my major It was not his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman has been forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who has ended up diagnosing a confusion of the personality, making it incapable of the service.
In January 2010, it has been dismissed under terms less that honorable, preventing it from receiving indifferent advantage.
The business Lyman and other plaintiffs will advance or not, it is a long history, declares John Turley, teacher of right to the Faculty of Right of the university of Washington.
However, it makes to notice, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance".
Only this doctrine criticized for his introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the doctrine Feres.
The army finds itself of the decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of dissuasion put by the responsibility.
"The chances are heavily against them... but it is important "that they try", it adds.
These things change uniquely while the good ones have the will of fighting.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will rally his hundred other plaintiffs for other trials.
"We will continue fight against the army on this question as long as reform will not be" it asserts.
Where jusqu"à what we would die, one or the other one of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple lad making part of his anti-immigration opinions online.
Monday, Breivik, which has admitted to have been seized by a murderous madness in Norway at the month of July leaving 77 victims, has been confronted with his first trial.
Even though Breivik has acts alone, it was far from the being on the cyberspace: he had spent a great part of the time preceding the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the million nationalists who support the groups of extreme right on the sites of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wish to know some more on these people.
But how to take them on?
Easy... Do you connect to Facebook.
"We have realized that him n"était not as difficult as that of finding them", declares Jamie Bartlett, main author of a relation published lately by the think tank of DEMOS on the numeric populism in Europe.
Facebook abounds in so many personal information, asserts Jamie Bartlett, which the researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to consider it the people that they look with a precision for scientist - the way whose marketing experts make it for years.
L"équipe of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that a half-million of members are fans of the groups of extreme right in Europe. She has targeted them with announcements, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the announcements invited the users to reply to an inquiry. The asked questions concerned their level of education, their attitudes in view of the violence and their optimism as for their own future.
Getting with these people in contact thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to question 10.000 partisans of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It is a new way of making research", declares Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all amazing: the online partisans of the groups of right are rather men, young and against the immigration.
But astonishingly, "those that associate online activism and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that remain behind their screen of computer."
L"étude of DEMOS is only an example on the way in which Facebook has become the new inescapable tool between the hands of the scientists.
The think tanks, the researchers in medicine and the political scientists use the site to study all the subjects that affect the questions of health as the social tendencies, thanks to the "I love", publications on the walls and updatings of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three contents by day, the "supernova of the data" generates an explosion as regards research, increasing the number of works of research of which the name of the site appears in the title nearly of 800% in relation to the five last years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook resides in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not bring closer to the street.
"Before, while you tried to carry out inquiries on the people of the British national party, identifying them was very difficult."
"You had to surrender to the party, but never they would have allowed to you to go", declares Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook spare all that to you have directly access to their information. "
Others say that the site could offer a means of identifying and of treating the sanitary and social problems.
According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the university of the Wisconsin-Madison, and of his colleagues, the young students who talked about Facebook of their exploits in a state of intoxication had enormously more chances of being alcoholic than the discreet students on that subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could watch the site and intervene to help possibly a student whose statute would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can not treat a problem if you do not diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and manager of the center for the health, the behavior and the development of the children at the Institute of research for the children situated in Seattle, asserts the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify the children with risks, and that would not be in another case not recognized."
Facebook also reaches the information of his users constantly.
L"équipe of the site that takes care of the data has studied the statistics regarding the passionate situation and the day of the saint Valentin, the rate of participation to the elections of mid-mandate of 2010 and a clue of national happiness (thanks to the uniquely available information - the champions of the numeric freedom have during long elevated that the site could make available his treasure of data to other people at ends of research).
But the users of Facebook know that the site observes them, that that enjoy them or not - in return for being able to play at the Scrabble with a friend that feels at thousands of kilometers, the site is allowed to reach your information.
But what does he pass to itself while the users of Facebook are part of an inquiry whose same step heard speak they do not have?
Even though the researchers have orders well defined as for the way of gathering the information otherwise that going by by the Internet, it is every other online thing.
"I do not believe that a great number of users already have thought by the way that a researcher can study their profile" declares Neil Selwyn, sociologist to the Laboratory of the Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 that it has led observing the walls Facebook of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going by by Internet, there is not any guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, experiencing the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user is impossible.
"It that you say about Facebook and what you make in the reality is two totally different things", asserts Neil Selwyn.
It is why, in spite of his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a desk pad and a pen remain the best tools that one can use.
"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with the people," it declares.
"The social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social one, it is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man having admitted to have organized the two attacks that have made 77 dead men in Norway this summer, is described itself as a combatant "of the resistance" during his first appearance to the trial that takes place in Oslo.
"I am a military major of the movement of Norwegian resistance and of the Templars of Norway", it explains in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"In what concerns the ability of the court, I challenge it, because you have your mandate from organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim has interrupted Breivik during this monolog because he did not "want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, it has refused to let talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the audience Breivik, which has taken a speech with it on paper.
The judge Nesheim also has asked to the Police to keep Breivik in possession twelve weeks furthermore, has it taboo of speaking to the media for four weeks and has warned it of the authorities watching of very to all the visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
Thirty of parents of survivors and of victims were present to the audience.
Some have come to the hope to concern Breivik in the eyes, of other to be sure about his being put behind the bars.
Everyone have participated in the audience with the aim of seeing the end of the trial.
"I have found it cold and inhuman" has declared a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"Me n"étais not comfortably, but a bit I have advanced personally after having seen and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and in a blue tie, Breivik has remained quiet and professional during the whole trial. It has concerned the journalists and the survivors in the eyes entering and going out from the court.
In spite of the strange idea according to which Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge has determined that it was not mad. Also he has declared that there is not any proof that it has acts with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22nd seem to be therefore the work of an extremist rather that of a whole group of radicals, what will comfort maybe some.
But that does not reduce the sorrow or the confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I will have preferred that it looks like a monster, but it is not the case", has declared a parent of a victim.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons of the interview lost of Steve Jobs, to the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on last October 5th, some have compared it with Henry Ford - being distinguished by the genius technique and inventor of the modern computing.
But it that the fans of Apple can find of more revealing in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found lately and who will be broadcast this week in first part of a film on the main markets, is to what point this creative mind had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. It identified with a hippy but was also very meticulous and organized, as an améliorateur of flowcharts - a man who believed that numerous leaders of firms suffered from an "illness leaving to them to think that an inspired idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a sizeable quantity of manual work separates an inspired idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series relates the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long one and rare conversation.
At that time, that made about 10 years that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He worked already hard on his new computer firm NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
Even though a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he declares that the main copies have disappeared to the transport.
It is uniquely after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the director.
This video, lightly gone back, is the base of the film of 68 minutes titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be diffused to the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For well known somebody to hate the maintenances deepen, Steve Jobs seems here astonishingly enthusiastic of displaying technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.
And unbelievably attentive.
On four different points during the meeting, the replies come a long moment after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of thought, during which Steve Jobs weighs clearly his thoughts, with the aim of bringing a reply clarify.
One discovers also moments that the perfectionism of Steve Jobs reappears, where hearing the questions of Cringely, giving him blows of elbow to make it accelerate and to go by to the questions or subjects of greater importance, seems impatient.
Filmed before l"ère of Pixar, of the iPod or of the iPhone, one finds a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers of of good or of bad among the other firms and made part of his own vision on the future of the computing.
It is a thing to read the posthumous evaluations of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something of brute and of inspiring on the man that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of the size.
It has a vision on the way whose things can be and must be.
It explains them then take them of continuation in work.
These are a fast recapitulative one of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On the way in which he has learned to lead a firm:
For all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you make the things'? and the replies are constantly the same ones: 'oh, simply because they must be made."
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks in depth about the things in a firm.
It is what I have discovered.
Steve Jobs continues giving details on his efforts aiming at simplifying the accountancy at Apple.
Perplexed as for the way whose costs were recorded - one begins often by a "standard cost" evaluated in view of nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a turn to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue box" that it has created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to pirate the telephonic networks and to phone for free in longue-distance.
The device has been the subject to numerous written languages beforehand, but the euphory of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is infectious.
It describes the way of which it and Wozniak have tested the box using a public phone, passing a call connecting oneself then of a network AT&T to another all bypassing as many satellites that possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things a half-a-doz of time and you shrieked in the public phone and that a minute later arrived to you to the public phone of nearby," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we have learned that we could ourselves to create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructures in the whole world. "
We did not know much all two, but we have known to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have a day been without that.
Steve Jobs continues telling a wonderful turn that it and Wozniak have designed: he has phoned in Vatican with the Blue Box to the beautiful environment of the night being made be taken for Henry Kissinger and has asked to talk to the Pope.
Even though several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convoked in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in mad fair laugh before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with the technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett):
To l"âge of 12 years, to the hunt for the spare parts to produce a frequency meter, he looks for the number of Bill Hewlett in the yearbook and passes a phone call to him.
Little after their conversation of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs obtains a job from summer part-time at Hewlett-Packard.
"That has had one remarkable influence on me. C"était the only firm that I had seen to that age and that has formed my definition of a firm and the way whose employees are treated."
Steve Jobs has thereafter become one of the employees HP to visit the laboratories of research of the firm, situated in Palo Alto, where he has discovered the "first computer of office ever conceived."
It was as big as a suitcase was, possessed a small cathode ray tube. I have fallen of it in love.
The adolescent that j"étais has returned to HP and has started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of the innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks of inventing new products on a blow of head.
At the beginning of his career, even though he settles to sell some cards of printed circuits, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only on 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembling as of the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties met to develop a mouse of computer:
"I remember big arguments... one cried me top claiming that I would need five years [to produce a mouse that would cost $300]. I have had enough, I have gone out and have gone to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could produce for $15 and that proved unbelievably reliable.
On the great firms that exhaust themselves:
Well before it does not make to live again Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way about which of numerous industrial leaders were going to make a mistake and the control of their part of market lose.
Let's "admit that you worked among IBM or Xerox, you make a better cheat or a better printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the firm does not meet more success.
The sales and the marketing can make it to evolve, therefore [it is these types of people] that ended up leading the firms and the staff specialized in product is put to l"écart of the captures of decisions.
The genius in product that has driven to this position of monopoly completely is rotted by the people that can not imagine to conceive a good product in relation to a bad product - the required manual work.
It is what has happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to hold all the computer industry.
It would have been able to make ten times his present size. Xerox would have been Microsoft of the years 90...
They have torn away the defeat from the victory.
On the innovation as artistic form:
"An enormous part of manual work separates an inspired idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn enormously on his subtleties.
There are compromises to make... Some things that you can not make, the electrons can it, the glass, the robots, the factories also.
You must keep thousands of things to the mind (these concepts) assembling them ones to the others.
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is a matter of trying to expose yourself to the best products that the men have created, and to try to bring these things at the product that you create.
Picasso has said a day that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing excellent ideas.
It is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked above were musicians, of the poets, of the zoologists, of the historians, who have simply proved the best computer scientists at the world.
If it is not for the computer science, they would have made things extraordinary in another domain.
Scalia and Thomas dine with adversaries of the right of the health even though the court meets
On the day where the High Court meets behind closed doors to examine the question of political discord, that is to say if the opposition to the law of the President Obama of the health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed during a dinner sponsored by the office of lawyers that will defend the business in front of the high court.
The event was located last Thursday, while the nine judges have met for a conference aiming at discussing petitions for examination.
One of the businesses in question concerned a trial brought by 26 States contesting the reform of the care of ambitious health voted for by the Conference last year, a law that has been a point of rallying for the conservative militants to the national ladder.
The judges have admitted to hearing the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5h30 is waited in next March, and the result will be probably by nature to favor the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full expansion to the moment where the decision of the court will be exhausted.
The lawyer who will stand in front of the court and will argue about the rejection of the law, will be likely Paul Clement, who has served as general supplicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal office of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of the two dozen offices that have helped Federalist (Federalist Society), a group of long date dedicated to defend the conservative legal principles, to sponsor the annual dinner of the Society.
Another office that has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that have contested the law, the national Federation of the independent firms (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter has been the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presents an enormous financial stake in the result of the dispute.
The dinner has been held at a Washington hotel some hours after the conference of the court on the business.
Was there, between others, Mitch McConnell, republican beep of the Senate and adversary declared of the health of the law.
The guests celebrity to the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is not new: the two judges have been present to the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is not anything that goes contrary to the rules from deontology.
Actually, the judges are exempted from code of behavior that governs the actions of the federal judges.
If they were it, they would argue no doubt by the code of Canon 4C, which stipulates: "A judge can attend collections of fund of the organizations related to the right and other although the judge can not be a participant, a guest of honor, or extra on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the office of lawyers of the business, as to a firm having a massive financial interest, has sufficed to alarm the activists of the governmental ethics.
"This violation of the ethical and superb one indifference with regard to the code contradicts the declarations from several judges that the Court respects the same applicable rules to all the other federal judges", has declared Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined and to a collection of fund of gala with lawyers that have cases in authority in front of the court".
Their presence and their participation to the collection of fund of this event takes apart every complaint of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little consideration for the criticisms maintaining that they mix too much easily the businesses of the court with the agenda of such groups that the Society Federalist.
And the woman of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative militant of top-profile.
Besides, the conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan that has a problem of ethics, both not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan has been a general supplicant of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law have been carried at the level of the county court.
His criticisms have made pressure so that Kagan refuses to give an opinion to hear the case, saying about the law that she had too much given itself into the defense to be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that it would make it.
Boeing records a record command of 18 billion dollars for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, airliners bi-corridors, with the possibility of buying 20 furthermore.
Boeing sells also six Boeing Dreamliners at Oman Air, a market valued at more than a billion dollars.
There is not anything extraordinary to what a company receives a command contemplating 50 of his products.
It is on the other hand a whole business while the company in question is the builder of airplanes Boeing and that the amount of these 50 airplanes affects the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Tout aussi incredible is of whom Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a gold mine magnifying future commands of airplanes.
In forecasts published Monday, the company of Chicago considers that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the 20 next years of 2 520 airplanes of a total value of 450 billion dollars.
In the course of the weekend, Boeing has informed of the command of commercial airplanes the most expensive of his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that has passed this Pharaonic command.
Boeing has announced to the Lounge Aeronautics of Dubai of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 airplanes furthermore, what would put up the total amount of the command at 26 billion dollars.
Of another side, Boeing has indicated Monday that the Oman company Air has commanded six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model who flatters himself on important economics of fuel and of conveniences for the passengers.
The amount of these six devices s"élève at more than a billion dollars.
"It is clearly very positive for Boeing," has declared Neal Dihora, analyst of the Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have an immense value."
In the Middle East, the producing countries of oil possess many of their airlines.
They have therefore not only the means of paying these airplanes, but an ascent of the price of the fuel - in a usual way prejudicial for the airlines because it does not represent their most important expenses - would not be them so harmful since the country earned money with the ascent of the price of the oil.
It is an important point because these companies will be less susceptible than of others of canceling or of deferring their commands of airplanes while the price of the oil increases, has signaled Dihora.
"They have a natural blanket of risk", it has said.
The command d'Emirates reinforces the predominance of Boeing on the market of the jumbo jet airplanes and helps Airbus to slow down the attempt of encroachment of the competitor with his airplane A350.
The victory of Boeing at the lounge of the aeronautics happens four months after the announcement of Airbus of taking back the beginnings of the greatest version of l'A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects his beginnings to increase the pressure continuation at the request of his customers of increasing his capacity of load and his autonomy.
The actions of the company Boeing have increased in 1.5% to reach the 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president obviously beaten at the elections of the Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon declares that the traffickers of drug have helped his adversary Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race at the post of governor.
The sister of the president Felipe Calderon seems to have lost his attempt of access to the duties of governor of the Michoacán in the course of violent elections, and she has declared Monday that the traffickers of drug have favored one of his adversaries.
The first results have indicated that Fausto Vallejo du Parti Révolutionnaire Institutionnel, or PRI, was in mind of the race to the post of governor of this State of the west.
"The intervention of the crime organized during the whole process of vote and in particular yesterday is one alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the very whole country", has signaled Luisa Maria Calderon to the radio in the course of an interview on the Monday in accordance with the elections.
"They have threatened our candidates, our canvassers... They have seized the ballot boxes, have installed roadblocks... and have obliged to the people to vote "for the PRI.
The PRI has governed Mexico for seventy years jusqu"à to lose the presidency in 2000.
But it organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win presidential l"élection in July.
Vallejo does not seem to have distanced that of little Calderon, which was in mind surveys before the day of the elections.
Calderon, candidate of the conservative party of his brother, the Party National Action, or SECTION, has refused to recognize Vallejo as winner.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate of left of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which occupies the duties of governor presently, has arrived third, a hard defeat before the presidential ones of 2012 for this divided left and unfortunate.
Aureoles has also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, previous mayor of Morelia, the capital of l"État, has denied every connection to the traffickers of drug and lively has recommended to the other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the cartels of the drug specialized in the traffic of marihuana, of heroine and of méthamphétamine.
It is a matter of l"État of origin of the president Calderon, and he has chosen the Michoacán to throw an offensive serviceman against the traffickers in December 2006.
Nevertheless, the violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the SECTION has been murdered even though it was campaign for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates have renounced locally the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, also corrupted that the elections of the Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in his boost.
The man that one waits for to represent the PRI in the race to the presidential ones, Enrique Pena Nieto, has congratulated Vallejo from Washington and has declared, "I think that this victory is very encouraging with a view to the next year."
The BASD incites lively Asia to come in aid at the euro zone
The Asian Bank of Development has asked to India and to the China of getting ready for helping the euro zone to go out of the crisis of the sovereign debt to avoid a decline in the long term that would prevent the development of Asian l"économie.
Rajat Nag, the chief executive officer of the BASD based in Manila, has declared that the two economic powers to the fastest growths of the world had to make all what is in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone by the device of the International Monetary Bottom or of direct bilateral agreements.
He has advised to the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) of looking at the difficulties of the Europe of an "indifferent eye" and has notified that an Asian financial support to the sides of the leaders and of the resources of Europe would allow d"éviter a collapse in the long term of world l"économie.
"We are everyone together in this crisis."
"Consequently whoever can help Europe to go out of the crisis is useful", he has told to the Financial Times in the course of an interview during the Economic World Forum to Bombay.
"Asia can be protected jusqu"à some point but it is not under cover."
"Therefore if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them."
These last months, the euro zone has seriously been shaken by a crisis of the sovereign debt.
Lately, the cost of the Italian borrowing has dangerously gone up in arrow and the Prime Ministers of Italy and of Greece have resigned.
The flourishing crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has made to spurt out the fear that world l"économie does not bring in in recession, and has aroused the call of the main emergent economics to meet to help the euro zone to take on a solution.
M. Nag has predicted that the IMF would dispatch every Asian help, but also it has declared that this bilateral assistance - as buying the obligations of the fund of financial rescue of the United States, the European Fund of financial stability - offered a greater to be able of negotiations to the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the minister of the Business and of the Indian Industry, has indicated that "India will make" all "what it will be able" to help the euro zone given that his own economics suffers now from a fall of the exportations and of a drying up of the arrivals of foreign capitals.
"Nobody wants the euro zone to be unstable and shaken", it has said.
"We have monumental challenges to raise and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where found us of the work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others maintain that the economics in development such as India should not help the European wealthy persons even though they make challenges economic in view of their important specificity.
Ashutosh Varshney, teacher to the university Brown in the United States, has declared that it would be politically very difficult to make a help accept in Europe to the 1.2 billions of Indian, of which at least 800 000 live with 2 dollars a day, indeed less.
"A day, they will discover that the Greeks take their retirement at 50 years and that they go on holidays to the sun and will have harm to swallow it", has signaled.
Lee Howell, the president of the economic world Forum, also has wondered why the reserves of India should be used to maintain numerous Greek officials well paid in badly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railroad sector.
M. Nag has declared that the crisis of the euro zone risked to cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The forecasts of the BASD of an economic growth of 7,5% in Asia in 2011/2012 face maintaining "risks of loss" because of the European threat.
It has notified that the vulnerable emergent markets needed d"élaborer "of the plans of help" to protect itself from an economic reversal and from important escapes of capitals.
Severe warnings of the Pentagon on the potential reductions of the defense
The Secretary to the Defense, Leon Panetta, has made the pressure on the Conference go up Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget compressions would sap the national safety. It has started a financial chain reaction of the corridors of the Pentagon at the battlefields of Afghanistan, passing by the unions from civilians.
The Pentagon digests already 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next decade, but He fears now that an additional amount of 600 dollars or more compressions is imminent if the Conference does not get to an agreement on the expenses.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry", has declared Panetta in a letter to the Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He has declared that the failure of the Conference to get to a budget agreement resulting as far as one calls the confinement, would take 23% of reductions as the frost of numerous new projects.
"A so important reduction, applied thus without discernment, would not give back most of our ships and of our impractical projects of building - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or of a building - and to undermine seriously to the other efforts of modernization", writes Panetta to the senators.
"We would be also forces to separate ourselves from some number of our civil staff and, because the reduction was imposed so rapidly, nearly probably we should send civilians in leave without salary with a view to reaching the objective."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those that support our servicemen and would damage our preparation seriously."
The reductions would touch possibly the combatant troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of the operations of contingency abroad is directly not touched by the confinement, the efforts of war negatively would be affected by the serious disruptions in the budgets of base ", has warned Panetta.
"The contracting staff would be reduced, taking delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract that support the war".
"The staff managing the salaries would be reduced, taking delays of payment to the purveyors of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted".
The two senators had written days to Panetta 10 earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequence of a confinement on the department of the Defense would have would start a fast decline of the United States as uncontested world leader of the military power".
"We are shyly opposite to this draconian action", have declared the senators in a common communiqué Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"It is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is probably not the one that we should impose to ourselves".
"The confinement is a threat for the interests of national safety of the United States, and it should not have to happen".
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to see.
Panetta has been more and more virulent about the possible compressions, even if it has arrived himself to the highest posts of the Pentagon accumulating years of expert evaluation of the budget to the Conference and the White House and knowing that it was confronted with difficult choices.
To a past press conference the week, the secretary to the Defense has painted a dark picture of what could appear - a serviceman with a shell, but not of kernel.
"It is a ship without sailors".
"It is a squad without balls".
"It is an interceptor, without enough formed pilots".
"It is a tiger in paper, an army of barracks, of buildings and of bombs that do not have enough formed soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission", has declared Panetta during his remarks preliminary to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed strength, badly prepared and incapable of making opposite potential adversaries".
"De facto, it induces to the agression.."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has stated specifically how new reductions could generate important operational risks: deadline of reply to the crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits at our capacity for spreading out and starting in the world; and unacceptable accepted risk in operations of future fighting".
And Panetta has declared that certain of the greatest projects of defense could pass to the cleaver, including those already tested and certain just to the first stadiums of the planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new predicted bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new ship of coastal fighting and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace the Humvee of the army and of the navy.
Putting a term to the development and to the testings of the F35 could generate 80 billion dollars of economics towards 10 years, but his partisans say that it is an essential stage about improvement and about reply to the potential threats of China and of other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A glance on the recent headlines indicates at what point the deceit and the lie are omnipresent in the daily life.
The republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy with exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; every side accusing the other one of lying.
The administrators of Penn State have been marked of perjury to allegedly have covered relations according to which a trainer of football to the retirement has attacked boys sexually.
Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken on by an asserting open microphone to the American president Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The member of the Conference of New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has been taken for an idiot emitting rapidly denials contradicted by irrefutable proofs.
The previous candidate to the presidential one John Edwards has been marked of violations of the financing of the campaigns related to the blanket of an extramarital link.
And then, none of the one that has lived the history will ever forget the media circus that the president Bill Clinton has started lying during his second mandate on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating to the tests of the school and of the university are a legion.
There have been cases where the teachers have given the students the replies of the tests in order to be made well see on their evaluations of performance.
The mentors that should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and the cheating are satisfactory.
How much deceit do we meet?
Towards a given day, the studies show that you can hear of 10 to 200 lies.
Actually, many of these are pious lies.
Another study has shown that the foreigners lie themselves to three resumptions in the 10 first minutes of their meeting.
To detect or to spot lies is an essential ability that each must acquire, at the same time for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a similar boardgame to, let's say, of the riddles, where the objective is of exclaiming: "I have had you", the detection of the deceit is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data gathered in the course of the six last decades in prestigious universities having led a research in depth such projects, notably in psychology and in physiology.
One of the search results is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
The liars look at you in the eyes.
They do not stammer, blush or do always not fidget.
Not to conclude only the liars is difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A detector of qualified lie can discover the truth examining the structure of the declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of reply.
I have passed several years to examine scientific results in the vast body and always emergent from the knowledge on the deceit, and it is clear that the detection of the deceit is a modern ability that is easy-to-learn and useful to sail in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include notably the hiring, the meetings, the negotiation or the management.
The good liars are skillful at well reading the others, taking them comfortably, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how the others perceive them.
We know of after investigations that the extroverts lie more that the introverts, what the men to call more lies "centered on them" even though the women say more lies "centered on the others" - usually to protect the feelings from somebody that the married people lie less often to their partners than the people not married (but that the lies that they tell have tendency to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as a heathen, the others are going to feel less culprit of lying to you.
How can you say if anybody lies?
First and Foremost, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
It is what one calls "to establish the mark data".
That helps to supply a reference point to measure the ulterior changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laugh, the vocal quality.
You must know if somebody moves in a normal way his feet permanently in order to not launch unfair accusations when you see it move the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for clues of verbal and not verbal deceitful behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not of the proofs of the deceit.
The deceitful people can immobilize the top of the body while they try to remember their history, they can point their feet at the door, bend themselves to an exit, change posture in a significant way or present a relief of "post-interview" - one exaggerated sigh of relief, one change of posture when all the difficult questions are past.
The interrogators indicate often that the maintenance is just finished to try to start the post-interview reaction fakely.
Also, mind the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has veered using the past all claiming that his murdered woman was alive, starting a national research to find it.
The deceitful individuals can also use an outdistanced language: "I have not had sexual relationships with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or to repeat entirely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Somebody can use much of "language of wood" during his reply to a difficult question: "Eh well... for true statement... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
That makes the reply perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is not magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of the abilities to recognize the deceit is possible.
These abilities will improve the chances of whom of avoiding the victimisation by swindlers in their professional and personal life.
The plan of controversial pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States
Some days after the administration of Obama has threatened to delay the approval of a project of pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - arousing the anger of the unions all appeasing the environmentalists - the society trying to build the pipeline says that it is ready to relead the project to replace it on the rails.
TransCanada has declared Monday night that it is going to move the pipeline thrown out of the ecologically sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project all the same is going to win his approval.
The society has announced the decision during a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, maintains that the company remains confident that it will end up obtaining the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
That makes with reference to the announcement by the Department of State the last week that it would delay of a license his decision of concession federal for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes allowing avoiding the zones of the dunes of Nebraska and of the aquifer Ogallala, of vast underground sources of water.
"It is a real way vers l'avant", indicates Lee Terry, a republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new examination of the environment ordered by the Department of State would probably have rejected every decision up to 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a declaration written the last week, has described the decision as being the decision of the Department of State, and it expressed his support.
The pipeline of 2.735 km would spread from Canada to the gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700.000 barrels by day for of the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
For it to make, it would need to cross six States.
It is hated by the ecologists, but he is loved by groups of work, which have bet on the 20 000 jobs valued related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposite to this plan make pressure that a law for strength the removal from the region of Sand Hills and of the aquifer Ogallala, a major source of drinking water and of irrigation.
The environmental study of impact in the process of the Department of State has thought that the project would put only limited negative environmental impacts, but the industry of the energy has declared that the general inspector of the ministry has organized an inquiry distinct from the process of examination, centered on two questions.
One is that a lobbyiste hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other one is of to know if a firm that has been hired to lead the initial study has been an inappropriate choice throughout his relationship to TransCanada.
Pursued Patti LaBelle for allegedly caused a young child to vomit of fear
A family of New York asserts that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle thrown to an explosion of violence in the hall of their building of Manhattan, has terrified their small girl to the point where it has vomited some of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" has frightened the small Geneviève Monk aged of 18 months, so much so that it has undergone "changes of personality, disturb sleep" and "the increased fear of foreigners", said his family in the course of the trial of the High Court of Manhattan.
It was on November 10th of the last year then that the technician of scene Kevin Monk, his wife teaching of kindergarten, Roseanna, and Geneviève got ready for going off on a trip in family.

"I have replied to it: "it that you say or think does not interest me".
It has become mad and has started using swearwords - the word"and the word" of a strong voice...
It had a bottle of water and has started spraying me with the water of the bottle.
She has declared that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
I have told to this woman: "Look at what you have made to my girl", says the mother of the child.
LaBelle has thrown at the mother - which kept always Geneviève in his arms - and has had to be kept by his environment that has it entrainée to a car that waited for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The small girl cried so loudly that she has started to vomit, it adds.
Later, the family has sent a bill requiring excuses of LaBelle, but it has not obtained any reply.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle have not turned over our calls to comment.
The complaint asks for not clarified damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, has declared that he has taken the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received at a work of charity against the cancer for the children.
"The goal consists in having responsible Patti LaBelle from his behavior", has declared Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a teacher of nursery school carrying a child of 18 months."
The climatic adversity has slowed down the economics
For the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, at Sinaloa the unemployment and the informalité have increased, the foreign investment has lowered and the economics has contracted
2011 is a year of which one will remember Sinaloa in the economic history, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called of the change, which has generated great expectations in what concerns the advances of the economics, but being given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange it is one deterioration of the main indicators of the economic development.
The low temperatures of the February, apart from of talking about the losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the economics of the State for the growth, have caused a contraction of the economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first semester of the year, justified by the historical one principally fall of 31.16 percent in the agriculture, that has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the relation of allocations by the frosts stemming by the Mexican Advice of Development Rural Tenable, there have been damages of 582 million 835 cultured hectares, of which one 78.03 percent have suffered of the damages total and the rest of 21.07 percent have suffered from the partial damages, the main disaster-stricken cultures have been the vegetables, the corn and the chick pea.
The fall of the economic activity has generated, until in November, a constant rise of the unemployment in the State, according to the Institute National of Statistic and Geography the unemployment rate of the State for the three first terms of the year one has observed a rise accelerated, because while of the January March 55 a thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed persons, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economic Population Is Activated, in the second term the rate has become 5.28 percent and of the July September the average has continued raise up to to the 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 a thousand sinaloens unemployed persons, a rise in relation to the first semester of 18 a thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
The unemployment to Sinaloa for the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, manager of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise of the unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the realized actions by the public policy.
"What one observes it is a rise of the unemployment that diverse factors is owed, among which the loss of liquidity on the market owed to a restriction of the resources by the legislation approved of in the Conference to fight the laundering of money, because for the people who win of the dollars in an illicit way it is not easy that they work to win them, that they surround them and use them in something", it says.
Held migration
López Cervantes has notified a demographic factor that the rise of the unemployment is also owed.
"The number of people who abandon the State to go to work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because going they have already many difficulties to take on work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, it that makes that the unemployment raises," has declared-you him.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the sinaloen market of work deteriorates considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between the conditions of work, according to the INEGI, the 60.38 percent of the population occupied in this state works without subscribing as worker by any institution of social assurance.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason of interval for the state are the low salaries, the entity has the lower remunerations of the Country, according to the registers of the Institute Mexicain of Social Assurances and the Secretariat of Work and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly incomes of the sinaloens workers has been, until September, 5 a thousand 352 pesos, very inferior to the national average, which is located to 7 a thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Apart from fall of the economic activity and the rise of the unemployment, in 2011 one has recorded the strongest reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment of the 10 last years, according to the Secretariat of Economics from January to June the IED of the State has reached 630 a thousand 697 dollars, what represents a fall of the 87.74 percent in relation to the 5 million 143 a thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same one period of the previous year.
Successively, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State counts a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per annum, recorded by the companies of the service sector principally.
The debt
Being given the script of economic contraction, the Government of the State has solicited in July to the public conference the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, destined for the investment in projects of infrastructure in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economics, the approval of the conference of the State has been of 2,600 trillion pesos and until November one has not observed any profit of the indebtedness in any sector of the economics of the State.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of capacity of management of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Bedroom of the Industry of Transformation, has declared that in 2011 there has not been a harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, ci-inclus the Government of the State.
"The yield of the economics of Sinaloa for this year has been really very poor, one must work intensely to recover the ground that we have lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, the effort of everyone and especially the already synchronized smooth running of it new has had to be lined up team of Government, let's hope that the next year is better much", has said-him.
Economic slowness
Loredo López has declared that events as the frosts of the beginning of the year have kept the economics of the State and have restricted his yield and growth.
"The bottom fluxe economic is product of several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economics that does not turn rapidly enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows having a satisfactory level e flood in the trials, products and services and consequently, at the end of the year we close a lot below the expectations "that we had", it says.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employer Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa has declared that one wants to channel the State to productive activities of more of dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that one has worked, we think that it is necessary to develop a program in the long term that redefined the vocation and the economic direction of the State, because it is important that one detonates all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa", it says.
To make much
The president of the Coparmex has underlined the importance of establishing a vision of future that channels the efforts of the Government better.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different domains, as regards economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop one programmed to long term", it declared.
It has notified that the present administration has shown advances in the way of management of the public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say it is that much one has worked and the Government is conscious of the fact that it is still much to make", it says.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
A résidente person at Novolato has been sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The General Parquet of the Republic has informed that the small condemned trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for offense against the health, in his variant of possession of marihuana destined for the sale.

Debts to the contributions to the works
The works of social character contemplated in programs as Hábitat, Rescate of Espacios Públicos and 3x1 adorned migrants risk of not being finished where of recording serious delays owed to the lack of economic resources, has signaled Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The manager of municipal Social Development has indicated that even if until now the programs of building have progressed, they are in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State has not fulfilled not of his obligations to offer contributions that overtake the 11 million pesos in the three programs.
It has notified that in total, the investment of these three programs is of approximately 50 million pesos, with which the State must supply on the 25 percent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have supplied resources for the works, consequently there is the possibility of a delay in their finalisation.
"They must supply a contribution with 12 million and in spite of the fact that the year is soon going to finish anything to us they have not given, even if since July they had to give us a part, it says, and us, for not to record not of delays, we have begun the works and much we have advanced, but we need the money".
He has mentioned that the past year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the correspondent contributions, consequently at the beginning of the administration the Municipality has had to solicit a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided for that occasion.
"Already we had suffered that in the period previous sexennal because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue work and this year us, to be able to have access to these programs, we have duu to obtain the resources to cover what the State" had not "paid", he detailed.
In spite of the fact that there is a commitment on behalf of the authorities of the State of supplying these resources, he has declared that they had made asked it to the Secretary of Administration and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the correspondent percentages happen the more in a fast way possible.
"They must supply nearly 12 million and in spite of the fact that the year is soon going to finish, they have not given us anything".
The Court validates "the analogical break" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of the signal analogical by the digitalises is one of the more important exchanges than the world has suffered the last years
The High Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has nonsuited the constitutional controversies that the Senat and Parliament have stated against the presidential decree that brings forward the one said "analogical break" of 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, ci-inclus the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, has considered that the president Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his attributions while it has issued the decree that details the actions to follow to realize the transition on television land digitalis.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, has been nonsuited for not to have not reached the majority described as eight vote so that the Court gives an opinion on the constitutionalité or non constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues be in force.
The project of sentence, elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, has proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because of the fact that the rules as regards radio and television are an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in fine of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reserve of law.
On account of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even have voted.
With this argument, so much the Senate as Parliament have promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and admitting the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions foreseen by this for the digital transition.
The plenary of the ministers has solved to nonsuit also the complaint stated by Parliament, without discussing the project whose minister Sánchez Cordero is as responsible.
In his intervention, the president minister has said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive can not structure through general norms measure them so that the public administration gets ready for it.
"Neither I do not consider that if it made it one would feign the autonomy of the regulating organ", and it has reminded that the planning of the public policies in strategic domains as the sector of the telecommunications is the responsibility of the federal Executive, which has the direction of the State as constitutional mandate.
The substitution of the signal analogical by of the signal digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the latter years and that is translated in a better exploitation of the radio ghost, a better quality of the signal and more chains.
Adjourning the change, has supported-you-him, would be to adjourn the profits of the digitalization that implies a decision of public interest that does not have a technical dimension only, "because that includes also economic, social, political questions and national safety".
These questions, has underlined-you-him, "require the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution grants Executive of the State to the faculty".
It has reminded that a great number of countries of everybody have already finished the digital transition and they have made it through Executive, in spite of the fact that they had the loudly specialized technical organs.
One can not conclude that the Executive, issuing the contested decree, has invaded of a form the sphere of abilities of the Conference, because it assures in the administrative sphere the respect of the issued laws by the Legislative, it assured.
One analyzes the possibility of a deduction "vote by vote" to Michoacán
According to the data brought by PREP to the fore, the difference between the first and the second puts of the election of the governor is only of 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 a thousand 74 total statements.
The possibility of the deduction "vote by vote" is a reality in what concerns the electoral trial this year to Michoacán, where according to the data brought by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) to the fore the difference between the first and the second puts of the election of the governor is only of 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 a thousand 74 total statements.
In this sense, the president of the Department Council of the Institute Électoral of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, has reminded that there are some days, the past 9 November, the electoral organ has approved of a series of guiding lines to harmonize the local norms to re-forms it federal in electoral matter.
One will remember that Michoacán has not ratified either his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the Conference of the State has approved re-form them little before of that finishes the legal deadline so that this electoral trial can come into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted his publication in the deadlines foreseen by the Law of the Official Newspaper of the State, with the argument of that it had some objections.
On November even 9th, the Supreme Court of Law of the Nation (SCJN) has solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Power Legislative place and has qualified as "disabled and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for re-form them constitutional, because it does not have the right "to sanction them or to contest".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal has declared that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guiding lines by the Department Council of IEM it will be possible of realizing the partial and total deductions of the votes by the electoral organ place.
Thus, the partial deduction of votes, of a or several electoral packets, it can itself that: the results of the statements do not coincide; there is not statement of ballot and deduction in the file of the ballot box is not at the president's of this; or there are mistakes or evident alterations of the statements.
Furthermore, the total deduction of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election will be able to be realized while there is a clue of the fact that the difference between the winning supposed candidate of the respective election and the one that has obtained the second place in the ballot is equal or by underwear of a point of percentage; to condition of that at the beginning of the session exists an express petition of the representative of the party and/or coalition that has presented the second of the signal candidates.
The total deduction of the ballot can be fulfilled also if at the end of the common deduction it results from percentage that the difference between the winning supposed candidate and that of the second place is equal or inferior to a point, to condition of that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has gone out second, case in which one will exclude the electoral packets that have been an object from the partial deduction.
One must mention that that is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 pourcent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total statements.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The Prime Minister referred to, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will make opposite one crisis who has put this country at the edge of the economic disaster
The Prime Minister referred to, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government that will make opposite one crisis that has put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has put in peril the whole Eurozone.
A communiqué of the presidential palace has announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
One waits for it to present a composed office in her majorities by technocrats, even if it is not oyster bed when the new executive will accept his post.
Monti has said about his conversations with the political parties that it was going to present the result to the president in his testing of forming a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute trust in the capacity of our country of surmounting this difficult stage", has told the previous European commissioner to the journalists.
Monti has not said explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of his comments have indicated that the obstacles have been surmounted.
The "frame well is drawn now", it added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time more reduced than in a normal way, while Italy fights a crisis political and financial that has pushed the costs with his debt at levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by the previous European commissioner Monti must approve of a hard packet of austerity required by the European leaders to recover the trust in Italy that had been affected.
Underlining the pressure on Monti so that he hurries, the instability of the markets to put the yield of the Italian obligations BTP at 10 years over of on the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the patronal Italian Confindustria, has said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we would support this government much".
We think that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy goes out from this situation of urgency.
The possibilities of success of Monti have been stimulated considerably by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, at which the crisis has obligee to resign on the past Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the teacher Monti will have a good result", has declared to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the party of center-right.
The support of PDL, the greatest Italian party, is significant because until now many of his members were themselves opposite to the Government of technocrat majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply it that probably will be of the re-form of austerity unpopular.
Every blocking or delay in his efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack of the stock markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches has added to the pressure observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti has begun Monday his consultations with the political parties, unions and employer groups both of the youthful organizations and of women.
It will finish his round of meetings Tuesday at the night.
Monti has been appointed Sunday by Napolitano, which has entitled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of the past week, while it has been clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt now have brought back to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillions of euros, it would be too much for the present financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti has said that his Government should persist up to the future elections, foreseen for 2013, in spite of the predictions generalized on the fact that the politicians will give to him only the time of applying re-form them before bringing forward the elections.
Monti has said that he would love to include politicians in his office, but the great parties stress the fact that this must be formed only by specialists, a clue of their objections in the face of a process obliged by the financial pressure.
Political sources have notified that the reciprocal mistrusts and the disagreements between the parties complicate the testing of including political faces.
The experience of the Spanish ones is superior to that of the costariciens ones
Of the 22 footballers called of the Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On behalf of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked ones has participated in 50 meetings.
An enormous contrast to that of Costa Rica, if one compares the 22 ones convoked by the two countries for the friendly one of today, to 15:05 hours, to the National Stadium of San José.
While the national champions and of Europe, the number one of the monthly classification of FIFA, count a roomy register of games inter-select of class A, the Tricolor only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This number has been reached on the Friday spent in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who act stars in the League and in of the powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain at the year one intense activities in championships of league and cup national and arguments in European cups as the Champions League.
To all that the experience with Furia Espanola must be added during the preliminary heat complicated of the European Cup and the Mondiale of football.
The costariciens footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited at a zone, as the Concacaf, that is considered of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greater record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal keeper Íker Casillas, that on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) has equaled the record of the previous goal keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will work today against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for the Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral steering wheel of the Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even have been recognized the previous week by UEFA to quoted of the other centennials of the ibérienne team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the center-forward of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Loan of the centennial number finds itself Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, the two with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
Of the costaricienne part, and close to Michael Umana find itself the left one side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have overtaken the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The minuses.
Those that have some less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) appear.
Of the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does even not happen to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only a and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not begin yet.
The historical striker of the Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, follow-up through Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records the more, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has includes the country in his turn to celebrate two decades of path
"To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bass player Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, has said that the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts on the next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them happening in this country will also be a dream become reality.
It is that the bass player and member founder Jeff Ament has assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, the past week.
The group finds itself in the wing sud-américaine of her turned of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make his unique stop over in Central America.
That day will appear on the National Stadium, from the 19:30 hours, beside the group of Los Angeles The X and the national ones of Las Robertas.
That is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in La Nación on Internet.
For his costariciens followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream become reality. Are you conscious of what your fans live?
To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us also.
This is our second time in South America and Central and until now that has been grandiose.
I have spent in Costa Rica only a time the vacations; it is a so beautiful country and I think that we will be able to spend some days.
It moves us therefore to carry our music over there.
I ask for you, because there is a kind of devoutness to the group, the fans live the previous days with intensity.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank-you of remaining beside us during everyone these years.
Him have needed 21 years so that we arrive to Costa Rica; thank-you of having waited for so much and we are sorry of the fact that so much time has had to pass up to this concert.
Some people say already about the year that his concert is the greater show.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the greater shows that we have offered for the last 21 years have taken place in the two last weeks.
We have offered one two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient to produce us on it.
We like this country, we love to make surfing and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.
How have you discovered Costa Rica and his waves to make surfing?
We have many surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives at Tamarindo and the waves are incredible over there.
My friends went always to make surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, to quoted of Mexico, are great places to make surfing; it is as we have learned it, through the gents that like the surfing.
Seeing the round, you offered aves of the enormous shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never happened over there, we do not have any restriction in what concerns what we can make.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a great variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of every album and to offer our fans a good and diverse notebook.
You never repeat the notebook.
At what is that owed?
I believe that it is partially because we have nine disks and can interpret more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, it is for that that it is very difficult to choose what songs to interpret every evening.
While we have two or three songs in the notebook that we have not interpreted anymore for very long, that helps to us to remain concentrated and surprises us because that reminds us the reasons for which we like these songs and that we can have forgotten.
That fact that the show is more interesting for us and consequently I think that it also becomes more interesting for the people.
With this round, you celebrate 20 years of path.
Looking backward, is believing all what you have succeeded at difficult?
Yes, absolutely.
In first place, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a great rock group, and the fact that we have made it for more than 20 years fact that that seems a dream.
We continue tell our benedictions and the fact of being able continue play music together moves us much.
We love ourselves and we adore to create music.
We are lucky of to go to places of the world to which always we have wanted to go.
The things could not go better for us.
That means for you makes it of having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
Forming part of this group of great groups has been always an honor for us.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is amazing while a movement arises of a group of friends and is little common.
From time to time, a group arises of a city, but it is much stranger while five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and forming part of the group of Seattle is an honor for us.
We play still with some of them from time to time.
The past year we have participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen to Soundgarden in their round, therefore we are lucky of being still friendly with all them and it is an honor for us to form part of this sound of Seattle that has arises.
It is as very strange as a group as the your is maintained itself uni and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us have been a unity for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is a lot more time that many groups owed in a normal way.
In first place, I believe that we are everyone lucky of being still in life and, in second place, we worry everyone for the others.
We are all personal friends and grace has that it is of the musical boulevards that give freedom to each of experimenting.
We have trust ones in the others with the music of each and that could not go better.
Your relationship with the celebrity word has not been easy; though, thanks to your success, you have been able to make what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, that has been easier for us of finding a balance.
We check on the fact that we do not spend too much time in round because beating in this game great multitudes and people who like your music is easy.
If one does not forget that the people are there for the music, that us help to not to forget that the music must be respected and it that has brought it, without putting itself in mind the fact that one is famous and a star rock, what does not interest really in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think that we have written good songs and initially that has been grandiose.
We have been a group nearly for three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There have been many frustrations for the fact that it has lasted so little and the most important is makes it that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that have begun in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think to the incredible person that Andy has been and how it made me laugh, that it has been always a pleasure of working, laugh, to talk music, football and a lot autres things with it.
He was an amazing human being and we miss it.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen it for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent videos to us with different suggestions and that has been the group that we have loved the most, therefore we are impatient to see it that Las Robertas can offer en direct and that must be very entertaining.
For what do you change always the words from Yello Ledbetter en direct?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), therefore I do not know.
It is it that sings it and I believe that it makes it with the first words that he imagines.
As bass player, what are his influences?
There is so much...
Among the first of which I remember it is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, against J. Sweeps, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could speak all of it the afternoon on the bass players that I adore.
How has succeeded Pearl Jam has to maintain raising the grunge in spite of the fact that this is not no more in fashion?
I believe that us all we feel a bit disconnected of the grunge word.
While I think some, that reminds the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have to me arises at the same time and, if that is raising now, I believe that that is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth the trouble to listen and the groups as Mudhoney make now the best music that never.
Initially, his music had some darker contents and now this has become more positive.
At what is this change owed?
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem slighter, but there are also songs, as The End yet Just Breathe described as songs very dark, even if these can ring a little positive.
With the two of them, when Ed has played them for me, I have cried when I have listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think that if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friendly, these things start influencing your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that for me.
I also think that one can also be happy and even so one can play music dark.

The mustached man plumber passes at the three dimensions with "super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, indefatigable, for 25 years to save to the princess Peach of the claws of the sulphurizing Bowser, but never it had been it in three dimensions: in "super Mario 3D Land" it will fight for the love of the teenager in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which happens this month at the stores of everybody, has been conceived from the beginning to exploit well the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, which allows working in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character that must say as the stereoscopy must work without glasses", has declared of the video game the person in charge of specialized press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez has indicated that "super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo conceived initially for this support", because until now of the successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was adaptations of the existent titles.

In these video games Nintendo makes a wink to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the games previous, which consists in the fact that the mustached man plumber must skim through platforms mined of perils to free to the princess Peach.
Me player finds of the novelties in the movements, the environments, suits and enemies and also in the cases of "feasible" Luigi.

To quoted of the Regional president of the government Catalan (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, have attended the act the previous minister of socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the previous mayor attached to the mayor and present alderman éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
Have attended also in the great room of Fabra i Coats the present minister of Social Well-Being and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the chief executive officer of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas has maintained that Trinijove has been born in a very difficult time and that present is it also, but it has added that the work realized until now "is a good base".
The president has given Trinijove as example to know to fight against the bad circumstances and to give the people hope in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something again for the entity and for the work that this realizes", it declared.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated of 11 of the 13 apartments of the edifice, to Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property to midday yesterday without no resistance
All seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of the number 51 of Street Balmes lived has taken end.
Twelve people have abandoned à midi the building that they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-parties that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without necessity of an intervention of the police, yesterday voluntarily.
At the end of the operation one has changed the bolt from the door to avoid the situation repeating itself.
"From this day a control of the access will be", asserted the administrator.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the edifice - the rest were lived-, have raged the wiring and a part of that of the water, apart from of painting the walls and leaving residues of every sort there, especially of the are shaky of alcoholic drinks.
The three first apartments were the scene of the parties of masses, which lasted until two days and despaired the tenants.
Beside the edifice there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, who has also been affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat has explained for Europa Press that from the occupation of the edifice his business has lowered a 80%.
The owner of the discotheque has evoked that the invaders of the property made disloyal ability to him, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the place of leisure had had to reply to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to this, the boredom was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the busy house and especially the participants to the parties organized over there, that were more frequent and intense the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the zone.
The person in charge of the discotheque has explained that the boredom was so big that it has even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and that makes the rent nine months that this forgives him.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) has also confirmed that the last weeks they had received more complaints on behalf of the neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had solicited the week passed "the immediate evacuation of the building to finish with the problems of life in common and civic responsibility that this caused to the residents and the degradation of the zone".
The popular leader has explained that before the summer only a story of the edifice was busy, but the last months the squatters had occupied all the stories of the edifice and nearly all the apartments and that in some apartments there have been flights also.
It is that "it is needed to finish with the impunity in this sense that it has added and to be implacable against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Yesterday also, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) has evacuated an edifice in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police have moved to the number 35 of Mount Street-ral, after having received the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people reached the edifice.
The four of them have been stopped immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of the summoning beyond the debate on the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
To the environment of the years '80, in full apogee of the déjà-éteinte Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed affichettes of promotion of Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona subway.
Furthermore, it contained also a comparison, in numbers, with the Central one Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, limits it superior of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the alone that does not direct on the north-south axis, otherwise top (mountain) - bottom (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was not anymore Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
That was the situation until, in September, the town hall has convoked a mega-competition composed by 16 compete for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door replaces in the idea of park, undoubtedly.
It is that, or well somebody wants to put doors at the field.
The apparait question very alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, so much in what concerns his organization as in what concerns the thought on the city is a theme of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is nearly a recurrent theme that two members of this old caste of elected representatives talk while they recognize themselves in an elevator about.
And that is precisely one of the rare opinions on which three architects of Barcelona, academic teachers, coincide that have appeared to it.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the forehead littoral "it is essentials of" to discuss on "the forehead mountain" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the city blocks green has not been led at end.
"One" must leave from the base that the vaster park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", has fallen the verdict the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" contains one "trap lexicon": these does not need to think "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some zones in which it is needed to act".
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies the suggestion as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Of the perils that are derived of "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the years '80 and that has had in the zone of the Forum "his singing of swan".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means to establish already the step in accordance with", in other words, his overtaking.
"One must think about new urbanistic instruments, of planning, because the present ones [with reference to the Plan General Métropolitain (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters".
Being held more to the question, Modol has an opinion that, simplifying, the side of the region El Valles of Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol reminds that there is already a work done by the Employers of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to her corporation of intervening in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he understands that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that allows the architects to enter to the debate, but "doubts" if it shapes technique must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success", it says) that one has of the to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the reply to the question that gives the title of this part is complex, because from the bases of the competition he misses a global vision of Collserola: "One has convoked 16 transverse competitions - dit-il - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is not a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the zone in his unity".
This makes, at least in that case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the gang immediately superior to that of Ronda of Dalt should foresee, in all his stretching, a zone of equipment that carries out a sweet transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this will be replaced at liberty
After 72 days of preventive custody, the founded one of legal power of the Casino Red has granted the forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against it for alleged blackmails
After having spent 72 years firm, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be replaced at liberty after the founded one of the legal power of the Casino Red it grant the forgiveness in front of the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack of the Casino Royal, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, has published a series of photos and videos in which présumément Manuel Jonás required it the payment of an economic quotte so that the mayor of Monterrey allows the secret working of the gambling club.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet has opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and on September 2nd this has been stopped and maintained in preventive custody for 30 days.
After four hours in the face of the Agent of the Magistracy 3 of Patrimonial Offenses, it has been transferred to the Detention Center 1, situated in the Old Area of the capital of the State.
It has remained there for the 49 next days while one has pronounced it a second order of possession after the agent of the Magistracy has nonsuited the offenses of corruption and organized criminality.
On 19 of October it has been transferred to the criminal center of Cadereyta présumément to have made to sing with a million and half of pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he has spent only some hours in the detention center of average safety because there were death threats against it.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25th an order of capture has been emitted by the clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who has said about the sufficient confirmed proofs that nearly after two months of inquiry it was to determine the guilt of Jonás, as that relative to the collection of 1.5 millions pesos of the representatives of the gambling club in return for allowing his working.
This Monday, the founded one of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, has appeared by in front the judge José Luis Pecina to solicit the forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; consequently it could recover his freedom in the course of the next hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Magistracy attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, has questioned García Gómez if the shame had been recovered and who of the associates of the gambling club had been the one that had granted the forgiveness, but the lawyer has tried not to communicate the name.
In accordance with the file 197/2011 one grants the legal forgiveness to Jonás Larrazábal and ulteriorly one will not be able to present no complaint relative to the trial brought against it; neither one will not ask him for any repairing of the damages and any punishment.
After the audience of the founded one of the legal power of the gambling club, to 15:50 hours one has organized the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón.
The clerk of the Court, Jorge Yánez, has moved up to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate with Jonás that it had been forgiven legally and his file would be classified.
It will also communicate him the order of immediate freedom that the judge has expressed.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives communicates the details of the aerial accident in which has lost his life the secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) has informed that the results brought to the fore on the accident in which his life the secretary of Government has lost, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, has mentioned that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot has noticed that the conditions of climate were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unity has had diverse contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unity has lost the fuselage".
It has informed also of the fact that the unity was conceived for 19 people, therefore this satisfied the particularities necessary to transport the staff.
Furthermore, it has said that the investigations made in the zone of impacte do not bring back the appearance of parts to the ground.
"In a research one has reported that there are not parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has appeared in a structural way.
"The helicopter had been conceived for 19 passengers and satisfied the particularities to transport them.
The ground presented a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is of having the results the more in a fast way possible; but the investigation can last some months, it can even last a year.
Successively, Gilberto López Meyer, chief executive officer of Airports and Auxiliary Services has assured that the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State worked quickly of cruiser and that has happened on a rising soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a working normal cruiser at the moment of impacte it", it says.
During the press conference, the SCT Pérez Jácome holder has enumerated six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical normative one, the flight has been realized according to the rules of the visual flight, what implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and to the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The relations in the AICM mentioned conditions appropriate to the takeoff, and to the fur and as the aircraft advanced to the bordering zone between DF and the State of Mexico there were coats of nebulosity to weak height.
Selected roads:
It is probable qu"à cause of the conditions of nebulosity the crew has looked a weaker zone of height and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impacte it.
The coordinates of impacte it and the last recording of the aircraft on the coincident radar, probably before impacte it it has not been neither loss of the control nor alteration of the path of flight.
Scattering of the rests of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The available information until now allows of to require that impacte it has place taken on a right and side path.
The model of scattering of the rests of the aircraft allows supposing that the helicopter has collided with the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
One has not detected traces of fire or of explosion:
In the place of the accident there is not always any trace in the rests of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had numerous contacts with the ground.
During the works of ground one has found parts of the aircraft to a height of 9 a thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground presented a slope that goes for seven derig at 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which maybe it has dismantled at the length of his journey.
The information supplies elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter can have had of the impactes multiples with the ground.
After the meticulous research in a zone roomier than the place encircled, around the accident, one has not found parts disperse of the aircraft, what supports the presumption of that the impact has taken place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of the obesity
Social Assurance leads an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of the children and youths; this is borne by specialists of the IPN
The Institute Mexicain of Social Assurance (IMSS) has announced that it leads an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of children and youths, called protocol 'Genetics of the obesity of the children and adolescents' that will allow having the markers associated with the excess weight.
In a communiqué, the leader of the Unity of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, has explained that one had formed one multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and attend social.
This team is pressed by specialists and students of third cycle of the Institute National of Public Health (INSP) and of the Center of Investigation and of Studies Brought Forward (Cinvestav) from the Institute Polytechnique National (IPN).
To the investigation one induces to participate the population having or not right, to present itself to the unity participant sportswomen of the IMSS to Valle of México, where are carried out the proofs to the minors every Saturday to leave of 8:00 hours.
It has underlined that the protocol has begun Cuauhtémoc (Estado of México Poniente) in the Sport Unity and that from October 8th, the activity takes place in the Sport Unity of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado of México Oriente).
After having reached the objective of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Unity Independencia (to the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sport Unity Morelos (to the north of Distrito Federal).
It has explained that the objective of this investigation and that e connaitre the components and the importance of the genetics in what concerns the development of the obesity and of identifying by the children and young Mexican of the factors of risk to warn the appearance of the chronic degenerative illnesses.
As one will celebrate on November 14th on the World Day of the Diabetes, he has mentioned that the objective is that of gathering three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the surveillance of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relative to the feeding.
They will also be asked for on their physical activity and their antecedents of family heredity of their illnesses, to avoid the factors of risk that start affections as the diabetes or the renal shortage.
He has detailed that the Saturdays one will apply to all the participants of the anthropometric measurings (weight, size, circumference of the size), arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one tries to identify the associated people with the infantile obesity).
Cruz López has notified that this investigation is the fruit of the worry of the professionals of the health for the alarming capture of weight in the case of the minors.
'The inquiries of health of 1999 and 2006 have notified that only in six years there has been a rise, in the case of the boys, of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of the girls of the 47 percent; in what concerns the excess weight one has observed also a dramatic rise', underlined the specialist of the IMSS.
It has indicated that the justification for the research of the markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by his genetic history.
He has informed that on average, the Mexican ones have one 65 percent of indo-américaine heredity, one 30 percent European and one five percent African and this condition is reflected in the associated people to the diabetes and excess weight.
It has explained that in general, the genetics of the obesity is translated in the inability from bruler the excess of energy that one consumes (calories), which settles under the form of fat.
The researcher has explained that the profit direct for the participants it is the complete evaluation of the children, what allows detecting if they present a degree of excess weight or of obesity.
Ila even says that the presence of the folds of color sinks (acanthosis) on the neck and the forearm indicate the probability of suffering from the metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors hand it over by written language to the parents, to whom one explains each of the measures and changes in the way of life that they must realize to warn the illnesses.
Cruz López has explained that there are three main components that cause excess weight, obesity and of other chronic affections: the sédentarisme, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to remain the majority of the day sat in front the telly and to use means of transport instead of going on foot on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric contribution, in other words the greatest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - pâté of meat at the cornflour wrapped in leaves of corn -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a top contained from fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to cause a mixture with a better yield, independently of the conditions environmental and of temperature
If signal them that the cobblestone were solved, it would not be no more necessary to repair 200 about a thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who has assured that if the process of building and maintenance of the bituminous cobblestone is appropriate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion about the blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of the Chemistry, it has announced that the laboratory of which it is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to cause a mixture having similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, so much to high as low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera has considered that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places in which the climate is heat, as some cities of the north of the country, extremely to improve the yield, and consequently, the training of the blackcurrants.
It has explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a unity of molecules of hydrocarbons, of the molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltènes, and of the molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, that unity give to the cobblestone her characteristic behavior viscoélastique.
The viscoélastique behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of nearly 180 degrees, comprises as a liquid, at 120 degrees C his viscosity is very big and at 50 degrees C it presents a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, it added.
That means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not regular and is altered for the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ has observed that the streets of Ciudad of México in their majority were covered by a flexible cobblestone, compound of six coats of materials, the three last ones of which imply the asphalt.
Between the more superficial coats finds itself the coat of asphalt, formed by small stones soaked in asphalt and compacted ulteriorly.
Each of the small stones that forms the coat, it signaled, is bathed year asphalt.
While the vehicles pass generating efforts, this lets the strengths spread very well in the cobblestone.
If one had modified asphalt, these would spread better, had an opinion to strive it chemical.
On the coat of asphalt, it says, one puts a last coat called coat of rotation, made in thin stone, in other words, of the sand that is also soaked in asphalt.
As this is the coat in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more de force mechanics than the coat of asphalt and supply adherence in the street.
Being the part of the cobblestone that receives and distribute the efforts, the coat of rotation also requires that this has an appropriate thickness and the material of which it is made must be looked.
The climate, especially the dampness and the variations of temperature, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, it says, because these affect considerably the yield of the coat of asphalt.
While the ground wets itself, the water spreads inside the coat is it is difficult that this goes out, it that soft all the coats of the cobblestone and consequently cause of the blackcurrants.
In the trial of training of a blackcurrant, it says, the first who is wasted is the film of rotation and only ulteriorly is affected the coat of asphalt, but the shame does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be cured to the first signals with appropriate programs of maintenance.
The member of the National System of the Researchers has explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrant and consequently the thickness of every coat of the cobblestone must always be bound pending vehicles and to guarantee his satisfaction, to avoid the frequent training of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera has warned of it being still a lot to investigate and to work the bituminous emulsions on the asphalt, for example, which in other countries exist already on the market and allow repairing the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
How the candidate of Valle has missed to be the new Colombia beauty queen?
Analyze factors that have made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not obtain the crown from Colombia beauty queen.
Valle receives his title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca has stayed with the desire to beat the crown of Colombia Beauty Queen.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna has had to content himself with the fact with finding himself of the winners on the podium, carry the crown of money and the gang that accredits it as new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday night to Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has gone up with the crown and the scepter, the department charges already 14 titles of Princess and Melina him one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who have been close to the crown but have been declared princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many people land is:
What has he missed? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in every presentation has demonstrated that it had it all to be the new Colombia Beauty Queen, because it had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Better Face Pretty of Fashion, of the titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who have raged the crown of Colombia Beauty Queen.
The first factor considered clé in the decision made by the juror of naming it First Princess is the fact that she has not convinced with his reply to the question "?Quel has been the book that has marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, from the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the reply of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form to culturalize itself, definitively I believe" that the book that has marked my childhood is "The small prince", it is a book deep enough.
At present I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should read everyone; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called "The ardor of the blood".
This reply does not have plait first and foremost because of the term to be culturalized and second for not to explain concretely in what way every quoted book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina has declared that she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and sage, he passes what must happen to itself.
And for everybody, read please a little, "The small prince" is a great book"
Between the launched hypotheses there is that according to which Valle has been destroyed by the favoritism.
A journalist of Bogotá has insinuated that being the favorite, the one given an ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prices (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best artisanal suit, and Queen Mother), "that has wakened the jealousy of the other candidates, has stressed out the queen and" it is not "for that" that it has not sparkled on the scene".
And one has noted that down in his first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and his two processions of the eve of the coronation.
Even if to the two processions it had seemed sure about it even, one has noticed that it did not have the strength and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como put up some" (as at home), of the Canal RCN has declared that is it that Melina had been referred to princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains the majority from the prices during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
Furthermore, Valle has avoided the press in the end, and that has been one mistake.
Another hypothesis it is that Valle has not succeeded in convincing the jury on his interest in the social initiatives, which is the gasoline of the National Competition of Beauty in fact.
It is for that that two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty has declared that they looked for a woman engaged in what concerns the social necessities of his country.
"Only the beauty is not sufficient at a Colombia Beauty Queen, it is needed to look beyond the appearance and to base itself on his social sensibility, that before beginning the Competition projects are already involved in", it explained.
One speculates also that Valle has erred through his defects of his bottom and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but that is contradictory, because precisely the jury has elected him as the candidate 'natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good feeding and responsible physical work.
The assistant of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco reconnait that Melina did not have the best body, that him in had best, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, that in reality for me had not been too notorious, has left it points last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the review Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle have been the surgical interventions that it had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle has not known to make them.
His body has never been his asset and it has lost because of this aspect".
For this price, which the National Competition of Beauty replaces for the first time, after the procession in swimsuit has arises one cruel prediction that has been fulfilled yesterday night, one said that that it was a small present that Raymundo made to Melina not to give him the taste about the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, a position that gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
Though, it will go by in the history as one of the queens that in spite of his dazzling passage by Cartagena, has not obtained the crown.
Thus has been the work of the person of Cali that has identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali has passed to the history as the man who has confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste of the CTI of Cali has passed to the history as the person who has confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes that work places of the CTI in the offices, this week it was up to 'availability' of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada that works for 21 years in the domain of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González has worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he has had to spend more than five days in the forest to happen to the place in which the corpses were than had to be identified.
The year 2000 it has become transferred to the capital of Valle and after having follows appropriate lessons, it has specialized in fingerprinting methods, which are the study of the skin of friction, in other words the palms and the feet.
For the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano one had warned to Eliazar of taking clothes at least with it for three days.
Something very big waited for it.
Friday the night he has left for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.
He knew that it had to identify two corpses and that one suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the guérrilla older of the world, consequently one has asked to him to take itself the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
But while it has arrived with the team of investigation to the place of the corpse, it has not pleaded it by his aspect physical, because this was very different from the one that he had seen in the medium.
It did not have beard, it was dressed as a farmer of the zone, without glasses and much thinner.
But the imprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a galtonienne magnifying glass, from the ink, a préleveur and a lantern, Eliazar has compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye has not deceived it not: it was a matter of "Alfonso Cano".
This same night, the man originating from Puerto Tejada has been the person in charge that has confirmed to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was a matter of the supreme leader of the Farc.
In search of the imprint
For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali the gratitude that the president Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people of connait not our work.
The fingerprinting methods are an exact science, without margin of mistake, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from of identifying the corpses, the dactyloscopistes press the investigations for the offenses as the flight and the homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people.
When are captured, many delinquents present fake identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the data base.
The researcher has related that in a case of flight it has had to take a part off wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to make to take out a safe full of jewels and of the money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get out a fingerprint, but in that case we have been able to obtain the imprint from the whole hand and to identify with the delinquent who had participated in different flights", he remembers.
The imprints can also discard or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Lately one has found a man died, with bottles of drink around it.
By interlude of the investigation one has determined that a parent can be a suspect of the crime and an imprint indeed on the bottle coincided.
That no does not guarantee that he is the murderer, that puts it on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopiste of the CTI has explained that one extracts "the fingerprints from the objects with chemical or physical reagents".
While they appear, one uses a préleveur or a gang to remove them.
Subsequently, the imprints are sent to Asif, the data base of the déclinquents, or to the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that it is still much of Colombian undocumented", indicated the expert of the CTI.
It has explained that everything is not how one shows in the program of television CSI.
As all what sparkles is not gold, all that one touches does not become forcing an imprint.
It can be used though, if one realizes the necessary confrontation.
The "incensed" ones challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators jostled themselves in front of the place Zuccotti to put on it.
A great part of the people have reached the order of evacuation and has moved to a neighboring park.
The integrating ones of the movement Occupe Wall Street have challenged it Tuesday the authorities of New York trying to go again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, of where they have been evacuated à l'aube and while they have tried to occupy another park of the Great one Forms a head.
Hundreds of demonstrators jostled themselves in front of the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to reach thanks to a judicial order that allows the 'incensed' ones to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement has replied to the evacuation occupying a park more to the north of the city, where there have been new stoppings.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we are going to settle on another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and pacific demonstrations", dit-un of the door-words of the movement "Occupies Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray has detailed that the reply of the ones 'incensed' to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has arrived up to the courts, where judges it Lucy Billings has expressed an order that forbade the evacuation forced of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the 'incensed' ones have occupied a new park situated to the confluence of the central ones Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entry to the tunnel Holland, which unites New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they have succeeded in occupying the place, but after the Police has moved and has stopped some demonstrators, even if Bray has not been able to confirm the concrete number, assuring Efe of the fact that he has seen whatever journalists to whom one had also passed handcuffs.
The organization assures that centennials of people are who had settled on this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved as a sign of support at the members of the movement and she has tried to intervene in favor of them in front of the Police.
Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti - who is a wall of private property - remains closed expecting the celebration from a judicial audience foreseen by this Tuesday during which one must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some demonstrators moved hitherto carried and distributed at that hour copies of this judicial order and they delivered it even to the agents who watched the place, what has caused 'some small confrontations', has indicated Bray, which has denounced the fact that some officials have struck the demonstrators.
The judicial order banned to the authorities of of evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or of applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or of forbidding to the demonstrators to reach again the park with tents or other properties that they used beforehand'.
The mayor Bloomberg has indicated in the face of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, to which though it has alerted of the fact that the local laws do not allow them of settling with tents and bags to sleep.
The alderman has defended personally the evacuation realized à l'aube instead Zuccotti, an operation during which one has stopped 200 people and who has been decided because of the fact that the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg has explained that it had given the order to evacuate the place because this became "a place in which the people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to make other people harm", because "some stores had received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation from this morning to the dawn has been repugnant and demonstrates that basically Bloomberg more is interested to defend the financial interests than those of the American workers", added the spokesperson of the movement, which accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of expression".
The persons in charge of "Occupies Wall Street" have indicated also that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with the community organizations and the unions to commemorate the two months of protest, which have begun on September 17th.

Japan renait after the earthquake
The GDP raises a 1,5% thanks to the domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of fall of the beginning of March
Since the month of March the Japanese economics was paralyzed, convalescent still after the devastating one earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Japanese country for the Second World War.
The first appraisals of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material losses at 300.000 million dollars, a blow that, in spite of the difficult world context, seems to have died down.
After three consecutive terms of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have served to turn the page definitively: the GDP has raised a 1,5% in relation to the previous term and a 6% in annualized rate.
That registered the second term - for the Japanese ones, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - imagines, besides, the more big rhythm of rise for the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery understands, partially, by the resumption acquisitions of equipment to restore the zones devastated by the earthquake and the posterior one tsunami.
In fact, the firms have increased their investments by 1,1%, in relation to the fall of the 0,9% of the expenses of capital observed from January to March, the first retreat after six months of non-interrupted rise.
Though, the truth stimulate of the Japanese economics is not based itself exclusively on the impetus Keynesian that invitation to take advantage of the crisis to strengthen - or to reconstruct - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies for croitre from scratch.
Japan has woken up especially thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, that presently represents the 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable has raised a 1%, pushed by the rise of the expenses on vehicles, journeys and activities of diversion.
The scar of the yen
Tokyo has taken up the domestic market while the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the elected representatives "safe investments" by the investors who escape the crisis of the debt in eurozone and disturb them forecasts of the States Plain, a privilege that weighs as a flagstone in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a divided stronger, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious back for a country of which the line of economic wavering is determined by the health of the great technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have made the contribution of the yen person in charge of their weak results between July and September.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
"The risks that persist must be followed, as the deterioration of some foreign economics, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen", has signaled yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And the perspectives indeed, are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) has mentioned that the majority of member countries have presented in September clearer signals of economic slowing down.
The indicator that anticipates the points of change of the world economics has put in relief that the main ones powers are braked.
Because this has lowered four decimals up to 100.4 points, in relation to 100.8 in aout.
Eurozone even has been underneath of the average, which is in the level 100, not lowering eight decimals up to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds the doubts again
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved of, but the conservatives will not sign no written commitment
With the peripheral bonuses of risk started and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues be confused in the labyrinth that drives to the exit of the great crisis of the European debt.
The sensation of that the "consensus" of the new Government of hellène transition is rather imposed by the particularities of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political strengths start being confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos notified yesterday that there is not alternative for re-form them structural and that the period of a hundred days establishes in his designation will be can to be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it was not going to support the new measures of austerity in any case and has reiterated his particularity of new elections for the predicted date, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is that of applying the decisions of the summit of October 26th", has declared Papadimos while it has opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will finish tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A packet of 24 programs to stimulate the job, re-forms it of the disciplinary code of the officials and of the news measures against the fiscal evasion will be the first initiatives.
Though, the message of Samaras no brings out the doubts on his position: "We have committed to helping the Government of transition, but we have not committed to anything furthermore".
The conservatif leader has gone a step more far in his pulse that EU and IMF, the organisms that must unblock the 8.000 million that Athens requires with urgency, and has said clearly about realization of the adjustments that he will not approve of any letter of commitment.
But the European Commission, irritated still by impacte it provoked by the va-tout of the referendum of Papandreu, has reiterated yesterday that his particularity is firm: it will unblock the help if the new Government and the leaders of the main hellènes parties do not sign "a commitment written without ambigüités also early only possible".
The spokesperson of the Economic Businesses, Amadeu Altafaj, has explained that the inspectors of the troika would return "in a very fast way" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth slice" of 8.000 million, even if neither there is not a definitive date.
The Greek ones have still much to make.
The Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for the progress and the hope"
The Queen underlines the "predominant" place of the Spain in what concerns this type of finances
Spain "has reached a predominant place at the world level in the role of the micro-finances".
The Queen Sofía has reminded that the country has become in these two last decades the second giver of the planet in what concerns this instrument of cooperation "whose gasoline" resides in the fact that this is an "instrument for the progress social, the justice and the hope in a future better for all the humanity, based on the trust in the human being".
The Queen has inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Summit of the microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty of there not being doubt" only this type of operations are "absolutely essential" to reach the Objectives of the Millennium established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has as goal the reduction at half of the volume of the people who live with incomes under a dollar a day, to which the "poverty line" is set.
Spain "continues work" to enlarge the network of beneficiaries "in all the corners of the planet, and accepts this task with "responsibility"," has signaled the Queen Sofía, who has hoped that the initiatives and the origin contributions during the Summit, which will persist until Thursday, "guaranteed the creation of new capacities and of the opportunities better for the poorest and especially for the women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have reached many objectives and we make opposite many challenges.
The Summit of the microcredit is envisaged not only as a heart of debate, but also as the platform has to leave of which "two goals of base" must be boosted.
Thus, His Majesty has explained that the objective is that at the end of 2015 175 million poor families are that have reached these financial services and that a hundred million of these families take out of the poverty line in which they live maintaining.
The impetus in the conception of the microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated some years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, has underlined the Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and gratitude owed".
And it has described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against the poverty", the work of which it connait for 15 years ago, while the Queen has traveled in Bangladesh for connaitre on the ground his policy of loans.
This experience has been followed a year later by the first World Summit to Washington and of other meetings as those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "to every meeting I have been able to notice an evolution continues", has explained His Majesty, of which the relationship with this project has brought yesterday the qualifier of "leader of family" to him gathered in Valladolid of the part of the "to banquer poor".
Finally, the Queen Sofía has finished his intervention encouraging to the present people to participate in the debate and in the research of solutions to advance in the fight against the poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The minister of the Exterior Businesses, Trinidad Jiménez, has warned of the solidarity "being an ethical imperative" for every democratic State.
In this sense, it has exposed that it would be a mistake of vinculer the cooperation with developping countries at times of economic prosperity, because this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez has considered that the microcredits imagine "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of the poverty", and maintaining "more than never" the governments of the developed countries owe to work under criteria of solidarity and not to leave not that this is the victim of the compressions.
For the Spain, the microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for the development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, has applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the "excluded" people "to whom everyone close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, has wished the present people in a city that "opens his contaminated doors of the supporting mind" the welcome.
The CDU offers to elect the European president to the universal suffrage
The first day of the conference of the Union Christian-democrat (CDU), Monday, November 14th, in Leipzig, has taken place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor's wife but also president of the party Christian-democratic.
The future of Europe was not initially predicted to the program but it has imposed itself at the autumn, to satisfy notably the militants who consider the policy of the government too lax in relation to the Greeks today and maybe Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, has been adopted to the almost--unanimity.
On 1001 delegates, alone nine have voted against and ten have abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which have had straight, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel then, some hours more late, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile minister of the finances, did not leave place to the doubt.
The idea-mistress of the chancellor's wife - and of the motion - holds in a slogan: the reply to the crisis "is" not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe, it is the peace but because nine million jobs "depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor's wife, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
That could be translated by modifications at the treaty of Lisbon allowing reinforcing the control of the European Union on the budget policies of the countries of the euro zone, but that could also lead on to the election of the president of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
Such a is in any case one of the suggestions of the motion adopted by the conference whose initiator is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Indeed, it is little probable that the twenty-seven of them match rapidly on this revolution: Great Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU think to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is it also.
But the ranging-pole is put.
Similarly, the delegates have thrown back to an overwhelming majority the suggestion of balancing the weight of every country to the board of directors of the European Central Bank according to the weight of every economics, it that evidently came back to reinforce the weight of Germany.
Concerned about appeasing the climate inside his party, the chancellor's wife has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl Mais it does not have either looked to win his conference piggyback of the "small" European countries or of the countries in difficulty prompt to criticizing assuming it Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "the franco-allemande friendship", Angela Merkel has not evoked France.
Except in hollow.
Reminding that there are two centuries, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the more humiliating undone of the Napoleonic army.
That represents the fraud to the stoppings illness?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the stoppings illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November in Bordeaux 15th to visit a crate of family allocations, and to pronounce a speech on the theme - recurrent for 2007 - of the fight against the social frauds and the assistantship.
And to accompany this offensive, which leaves of a will of saving money in a context of rigor, but is not an annonciatrice of an axis of the presidential campaign less on the right, the majority wants to concentrate on the stoppings illness.
First in a goal of budget economics: the government plans to impose private sector to the wage earners a fourth day of deficiency before the responsibility of a stoppage of work.
In light, without agreement of specific firm, a wage earner who falls ill would lose four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks to arouse anger, but that would allow bringing back 280 million euros, according to The Echoes.
And who would be accompanied from another measure, of more symbolic range: imposing to the officials a day of deficiency not indemnified in the event of stoppage of work (they do not have so far not grace period, against three days in the private sector).
Even though these questions are under discussion, the majority relaunchs also the themes of the frauds, targeting this time the abuses related to the stoppages of work.
"The controls are going to be much more important and, besides, if you are taken on, you will reimburse, has warned Xavier Bertrand to the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13th.
As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem about little disproportioned with the reality of the frauds to the stoppages of work.
This is indeed the subject for 2002 of a constant follow-up and of offensive policies, which have the most often carried their fruits.
The French not iller that elsewhere in Europe.
Let's delay us first on the national numbers.
According to the national Crate of illness assurance (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensations have been issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of research and of documentation in economics of the health, the daily compensations represented as 2008 5 % of the expenses of health, with 11,3 billion euros.
On this sum, 46% concerned the leaves maternity and industrial injuries, and 54% concerned the stoppings illness, or 6,2 billion euros.
And therefore 2,5% of the expenses of health.
In 2010, the French have known on average 14.5 days of stoppage of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting.
An average that hides certain gaps: another inquiry, published in 2007 by the site of management of career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40 000 questioned French wage earners said not to have taken any day of illness stopping.
Another study, this time of the illness Assurance, clarifies that in 2010, 37% of the stoppings illness were of a duration inferior to 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days at a month, 15% of one to three month and 11% au-delà.
When one compares them with their European neighbors, the French wage earners are not more prone than elsewhere to the stoppages of work.
A long study led in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence (for reasons of health or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% at the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud to the stoppings illness represents very little in view of the moonlighting.
As for the fraud, it reaches only a weak extent.
The reinforcement of the legislation for 2002 made that the controls are systematic on the stoppings illness of more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1,5 million controls, the CNAM has noticed that 13% of the 285 000 ones realized for stoppings of short duration were "unjustified or too long", or 37 050 cases.
In the case of the stoppings of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, one counted 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases on 1,2 million, or 132 000.
Altogether, therefore 169 000 "unjustified" cases, on several million wage earners having had an illness stopping.
A number that represents face, for example, well little at that of the moonlighting.
According to the deputy UMP Dominique Tian, author of a relation on the question in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billions euros of lack to win fiscal per annum, or more that the total cost of the daily compensations, and therefore infinitely more that defrauds it to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new program of adjustment to right his economics.
It is it that has declared Monday, November 14th the owing Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, the Parliament, adding that the a hundred days given to his government of union would not suffice to fulfill this task.
"To hound the efforts of recovery with the economics, we need the support of our European partners and of a new program of budget adjustment", has declared the leader of the government, which pronounced his first public speech to the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions made during the summit of the euro zone on October 27th will be the "main task" of the new government, because the participation from the country to the euro zone "is at stake", has added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos has foreseen that the public deficit of the country will be reduced "to the surroundings of 9%" of the GDP of here the end of the year, after having been of 10,6% in 2010 and of 15,7% in 2009.
The right refuses new measures of austerity
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, has brought Monday his support to the measures already approved of to try to go out of the crisis of the debt but has warned that his party would not start on an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures", it has said during a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He has told to itself agreed with the objectives of reduction deficit both of the debt, and of fight against the wastings but hostile to every policy that would prevent mends it economic.
In Olli Rehn, the European commissioner responsible for the economic and monetary businesses, who has warned all parties that they would support the predicted measures that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the loan of 8 billion euros necessary without written guarantee, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word sufficed and that he would not sign anything under exterior pressure.
The euthanasia and the attended suicide, said a committee of experts, must be legalized
The Canadians live in the denial of the death, according to the relation of the Royal Society of Canada
As regards palliative care, the publicity committee that the governments, the institutions of care of health, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in the denial of the death.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept indeed to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take arrangements for that purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing relation of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts connected to diverse domains have participated, of which the ethics, the right and the medicine.
This committee commends itself to the government of modifying the criminal Code in order to allow the attended suicide and performs euthanasia it, while this choice dominates, next to a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
Of entry of game, the experts quote a recent inquiry of l'Economist Intelligence Unites, who has compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada has ranked 10th, the bill study that "the medicalization of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the people are afraid of approaching the subject of the death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, bring back us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And in spite of the wish that most of the Canadians of dying at home have, 68,6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
On the Whole, from the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is the most raised, with 86% of the dead appearing at the hospital.
On the delicate question of the euthanasia and of the attended suicide, the authors of the relation arrive to conclusions that go contrary to the position of the federal government, which already has said not to want to change anything to the criminal Code regarding the euthanasia and the attended suicide.
Yet, according to the experts, who have also passed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized in review, there is not any proof that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, in other words the practice of the euthanasia or of the suicide attended on people not competent or not willing.
On the contrary, asserted yesterday in conference call Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the relation, one would find more numerous case of these overflowings precisely in the countries where the euthanasia and the attended suicide are not legalized.
"The euthanasia is practised in the Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"The attended suicide is practised in the Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians favorable to the euthanasia
Remind that 85% of the Canadians have already pronounced themselves in favour of the euthanasia because they believe that it would allow the people in end of life to reduce their sufferings, according to a survey Angus Reid carried out in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing the euthanasia will not have less value as effect of sending the message that the life of the aged people or handicapped persons has.
As for the people having practised the attended suicide, the probed ones value at 41% that they should not be pursued.
As regards maintenance or of suspension of the care next to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the relation.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the criminal Code that the withdrawal of the care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The committee of experts also asks that the professionals of the health are formed to the duty of respecting a refusal of the care in end of life, without fearing criminal pursuits.
As regards palliative care, the publicity committee that the governments, the institutions of care of health, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, as regards palliative or terminal sedation, already largely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the committee asks that it is considered, while it is not used to reduce the physical pain, as of the euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the domain of the right of the health have already expressed reserves regarding the conclusions of the relation of the experts of the royal Society of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, specialist in right of the health, has described as "extreme" the position of the signatory experts of the relation, among other things because it does not limit practises it of the euthanasia to the patients in terminal stage.
"That opens the door to a situation where everyman who would be tired of the life and who would have more than 18 years could ask to what one helps him to commit suicide", calls Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the relation yesterday.
Me Deschamps underlines also that the authors of the relation seem to put the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participate in the fabric of society of the society.
Yet, "in society, it says, there are beacons and pressures".
The specialist in the right of the health Margaret Somerville also has expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the relation, that it has described as "manifesto pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, which is itself member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular the data of the relation as for the absence of abuse in some countries where performs euthanasia it and the attended suicide are legalized, or to the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls the president Assad to leave the power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is isolated more and more
Partisans of Bachar al-Assad have shown yesterday in front of the places of the ministry of the foreign Businesses.
The diplomatic pressures have intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arabic League, the European Union has reinforced his sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring of Syria, have taken position in favor of a departure of the president Assad.
The king Abdallah II of Jordan has been yesterday the first Arabic leader to call the president Bachar al-Assad to "leave the power" in Syria where forty civilians and members of the strengths of the system still have been killed.
"If Bachar had the interest of his country seriously, he should resign, but also it should create the necessary conditions for a new stage of the Syrian political life", has told the king of Jordan, country neighboring of Syria, in an interview to the BBC.
For his part, the leader of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu has lamented that the efforts of Turkish mediation attracted from the beginning of the year next to the Syrian system have shown a failure.
"Those that are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and can not satisfy them will "leave", it has declared, referring to Syria, neighboring country with regard to which Turkey adopts a more and more hard line.
The United States are themselves of their side blisses of a "reinforcement of the consensus against Assad and the intrigues of the" Syrian "system", after the decisions of the Arabic League and of the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arabic League, countries as Turkey adopt a more and more hard tone" in view of the repression in Syria, has observed Toner Mark, a spokesperson of the department of State.
For this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the strengths of the system have perished in the region of Deraa, in the south of Syria, has announced the Syrian Observatory of the human rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have perished "during exchanges of shootings and of bombardment to the heavy machine guns to Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian minister of the foreign Businesses Walid Mouallem nevertheless has valued that the country "headed around the end of the crisis".
Moreover it has lively reacted to the decision of the Arabic League of suspending Damascus of his works, which constitutes "a dangerous step" according to it.
Syria "will not weaken", it has added, assuring that the plots woven against Syria will fail.
After his decision of suspending Syria, the Arabic League studies at present a "mechanism of protection of the civilians" and wishes for the sending of 500 members of Arabic organizations of the rights of the person, of media and of the military observers in the country.
The French minister of the foreign Businesses Alain Juppé is itself also called favorable to the sending of observers of the UN to help system that according to it is closed in in the "paranoia" to protect the civilians from the repression.
One news extraordinary meeting of the League is foreseen tomorrow in Rabat to make decided on November 2nd the point on the implementation of the plan of exit of crisis and foreseeing notably the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities in prey to the protest and the release of the firm demonstrators.
The Russian minister of the foreign Businesses, Sergueï Lavrov, has considered yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arabic League, while China exhorted to Syria of making of the plan of exit of crisis use while avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.

The previous European commissioner was under discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and the employers.
He should set up a relatively limited office composed of technocrats exterior to the Parliament.
"Monti has talked about an important program with many sacrifices", has said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups engaged in the maintenances, after having met the president of the Advice referred to.
The president of Parliament, Gianfranco Fini, has as his part said to expect what Mario Monti solicits a vote of confidence to the Parliament of here at Friday to check that the new government has a sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the leader of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti has commented on the nervousness of the scholarship holder and debenture markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and his program, it has underlined, calling itself "certain that the markets will be patient and will "understand".
His designation by the president initially had been greeted by the markets, but the anxiety has recovered the top notably after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in zone euro in September.
The Prime Minister referred to should appoint an understanding team especially of the technocrats, even if it has underlined that he would love to include "policies" in it.
The new government must last up to in 2013, date of the legislative neighbors, it has valued.
According to the president of Parliament, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain the trust from the Parliament of here Friday.
M. Monti has committed, once entered in office, to working in the urgency and in the goal that Italy "becomes protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of the European commissioner Olli Rehn has underlined that even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economics does not change.
The EU, convinced of Rome not reaching his objective of balance in the budget in 2013 in spite of the plans of austerity adopted these last months, has asked notably for new measures of rigor.
"Patronizes it of the" Italian "bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it Tuesday, has stressed also the necessity of relaunching the economics, "because a country that does not have growth can not respect the parameters of deficit".
M. Monti, renowned for his ability and his independence as European commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change in time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme", the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of the seriousness" and another "Italy", according to the editorial writers.
The great stranger will be the longevity of his team.
The president Napolitano would want to avoid elections anticipated, because Italy must put April 2012 for 200 billion euros of obligations of State from here.
A Russian scientist has helped in the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped to Iran to develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, has asserted Monday an American NGO specialized in the atomic risk.
The Institute for the science and the international safety (ISIS) bases itself on the recent relation of the international Agency for the atomic safety (AIEA) and of other documents emanating of this agency of the UN to identify this researcher.
The AIEA has made part the last week of his "serious anxieties" as for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing from documents of the AIEA, Mr. Danilenko, largely born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the years 60 in a Soviet military nuclear center to Tcheliabinsk (Ural), and the manufacture of synthetic diamonds would have been involved by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a firm producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have driven it to contact the embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
It would have cooperated of 1996 to 2002 to the Iranian program afterwards, before his return in Russia.
In his last relation, the AIEA evokes "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a system of nuclear detonation "has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, that not only knew well this technique, but that, as a Member State has informed of it the Agency, has worked during the main part of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his country of origin".
The crimes and anti-Muslim offenses have increased in 50%
The crimes and offenses against the Muslims have increased in nearly 50 % of 2009 to 2010, even though in the same time, the other racial and religious violence has lightly lowered or little progressed, according to the statistics of the FBI made public Monday.
According to these numbers, the total number of the violence perpetrated against the Muslims is passed of 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% of increase, against a progress of 13% of the violence against the Catholics, a fall of 4% of the offenses against the Jews and a global rise of 14% of the crimes and anti-religious offenses.
The total number of "crimes of hatred" very lightly has increased to 6 628 cases, of which 47,3% motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses increase again", has underlined the organization of the human rights Human rights First, "the increase of the anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", has added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First long has underlined that the violence against the Muslims, as all the forms of malevolent crimes, a serious violation of the human rights must be considered", adds one of the persons in charge of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must be more to attack these abuses", it adds, valuing that that could pass by an improvement of the relations of police on the "crimes of hatred".
The "crime of hatred" in the American federal right is an inheritance of the time of the fight for the civic rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence related to the race, the color of the skin, the religion, the origin and maintaining the sexual membership.
Twitter modifies his platform and looks more like Facebook
The site of micro blogging Twitter has introduced Monday of the changes in the presentation of his platform, to allow notably his users to observe the activity of those that they follow, what makes to look his service a bit more to that of Facebook.
A new tag "activity" and another "name" allow following more readably, en direct the activity of the other "Twittos", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") one follows and those that follow you.
That allows knowing if they make messages follow, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new formula of Twitter has been tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the unity of the network Monday, has indicated the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner, to the AFP.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinctive working, with terms about little esoteric (RT to repeat a message of somebody else, #followfriday to recommend of following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens thus to a wider public with a more comparable handling to that of the networks general public Facebook and Google+.
On the network, the users discussed by dint of "tweets" settled on the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, intrusive, and that looks too much like Facebook", written @jemb123.
"The Activity functionality is going to help me to follow better some elements of my flood Twitter", has sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
registration of a "budget "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of great coalition social democrat/démocrate-chrétien to the power in Austria has decided Tuesday of noting down in the constitution a "budget "golden rule" in order to reduce the public deficits and thus to avoid a possible degradation by the agencies of notation of the sovereign bill of the Austria (triple A).
It is the social democrat chancellor Werner Faymann that has shone even announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, even though the Austrian public debt is of 74,6%, largely above the criterion of maximum 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly in-underwear of the debts of country as Italy, Greece or the Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered only only of one notch, of AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interests besides every year, has argued the vice-chancellor and démocrate-chrétien minister of the foreign Businesses, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria falls thus with reference to a request for the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro zone of last October 26th: the leaders of State and of government then had asked for the registration of here end 2012 of the reduction of the public deficits and of a return to the balance of the public accounts in the constitution or in a law of same value.
The mechanism adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Of here 2017, the structural public deficit will have to reduce every year of 0,75% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, as from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State will not have to overtake every year 0,35% of the GDP, while the regional States as the towns will have to present budgets to the balance.
The objective is of making to pass the public debt to the horizon 2020/21 under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen had to continue go up.
"We will intervene as us have made it the last time if we notice an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, has explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen went back not to the historical levels that have driven the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
That day, Tokyo has sold massively yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor for 1945 opposite the green back.
But the yen regularly has gone back for, doped by purchases of investors who consider it as a "safe investment" in these times uncertain about economic world slowing down and about crisis of indebtedness in Europe.
The dollar has ironed Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has brought down under the bar symbolicalness of the 105 yen, close to the levels having started the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar quoted around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the Japanese currency night to the exportations of the archipelago because it increases the price of the cost of the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the incomes gotten out of the foreign country by the Japanese firms, while they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan fights to reconstruct itself" from the earthquake and the tsunami of March 11th that have devastated the region of the Tohoku (north-east), has underlined Mr. Noda who fears that this rise of the yen kills the fragile resumption in the egg.
The third economic world power has renewed with the growth at the third term -1,5% in relation to the previous term- for the first time in a year, thanks to a bounce of the exportations and of the consumption of the households weighted by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister has judged that the dearness of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamental ones of Japan".
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, has as his part called the Bank of the Japan (BoJ), which has opened Tuesday a meeting of two days of his advice of monetary policy, to take all the possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the assistant governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, has warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriated measures", letting understand that no additional monetary softening was Wednesday to be waited for.
During his last end meeting October, the institute of emission has increased in 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euros) his purchases of good of the Treasure, making to go by at 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts that it devotes diverse financiers to the purchases of titles to flood the market of liquidities.
Zone euro:
the rates climb, the Stock-Exchanges crack up
The risk of contagion of the crisis of the debt always drains the European clues.
In spite of the designation of new heads of gevernment in Greece and in Italy and of better numbers of growth in France and in Germany, the rates of the weakened countries pursue their rise.
Always worry for the stability of the euro zone, the European Stock-Exchanges sink a bit more in negative territory, this Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hr, the CAC 40 loses 1,4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gives up 0,4% and London 0.1 %.
"With the new tensions on the yields of the borrowings of the States of the euro zone in difficulty, the markets of actions across the world continue make a part of their earnings recent".
"The investors, nervous, are only too conscious of the risk of contagion" explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker by IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
The Stock-Exchange of Tokyo has enclosed on the decline of 0,7%, suffering successively from the renewed fears of the participants of the market about the capacity of Europe to contain the crisis of the debt.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has the eyes held on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as long as the investors will not have proofs that the situation is stabilized", values Mitsushige Akino, manager of fund by Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewal of anxieties towards the future of the euro zone penalizes the unique currency, which pursues his fall Tuesday.
The euro evolves at his lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 hr, the European currency is 1.3570 dollar worth, in fold of 0,4%.
According to the brokers, it has moved back after the party of the chancellor's wife Angela Merkel, the CDU, gathered in conference Monday, has adopted a motion foreseeing notably the possibility for a country in difficulty of going out of the euro zone without for all that leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The rates of borrowing of Italy and of the Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian obligations at 10 years affects 6,85%, that of the Spanish titles of same maturity 6,2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue feed the fears with the participants.
The leader of the Italian future government Mario Monti has asked for time at the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with suffocation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has, it, asserted that the implementation of the decisions made during the summit of the euro zone on October 27th would be the "main task" of his government.
The Spain finds itself in the line of test pattern of the markets, even though are had Sunday from the legislative elections in the country.
The gap of rate ("spread") between the obligations at 10 years of Germany and of the Spain has affected a historical higher new one.
In the waiting of the numbers of growth of the euro zone
Side statistics, France has recorded an economic growth of 0,4% at the third term, or a bit better that the 0,3% waited for, range by the consumption of the households.
The Insee has reviewed the number though to the fall of the second term, with a retreat of 0,1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And, it is truly the fourth that worries the more the economists.
The Germany, of his side, has recorded a growth of 0,5% towards the same period.
A first appraisal for the unity of the euro zone is waited for at 11 hr, even though the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energetic policy:
the facts must beat it on the dogmas
If it is a subject that one can not treat short term from considerations or under the blow of l"émotion, it is well the energetic policy.
The availability and the cost of l"électricité influence directly on the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of the firms.
It is healthy that an electoral appointment is the occasion of thinking at such stakes and instead that the nuclear one keeps there.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the unity of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, of the rational data.
Even though we are 7 billion human d"êtres on the planet, demographic l"évolution will take a doubling of the request d"électricité of here to 2050 unless one deprives an enormous part of the world population of a vital element.
In the same time, the rarefaction of the fossil resources will have to be compensated to continue produce of l"électricité permanently, without forgetting the imperious necessity of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas to fight against the climatic disturbance, a subject disappeared of the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.
It is why Germany is isolated in his decision of renouncing to the nuclear one.
It is not the case neither of the Belgium, which subjects hers to the necessity of being able to find a source of substitution capable of substituting oneself, nor of Switzerland, who intends not just to build last generation more than the central ones.
Conversely, the Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for not to quote only them, pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, them, have decided after Fukushima to add a unity to their park recovering the building of a central interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on the renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality annoys the speech.
The choice of Berlin is going to be translated by the rise of the price of l"électricité, an energetic dependence aggravated by the increased resort to the imported gas, in particular of Russia, a leap of the emissions of CO2 taken by the building of central to the gas and to the coal.
In some months, the unity of these regrettable effects are made itself already to feel.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Champion of Europe of l"éolien, of which it gets out 30% of his electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and of gas because of the irregularity of the wind; in accordance with which, his emissions of CO2 and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% more raised than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the constancy of our energetic policy, our neighbors settle a superior bill d"électricité of 40% at that of the French households.
Even though in a globalized economics the cost of l"énergie appoints manufacturer a key factor of competitiveness and a security of the maintenance of the tool on the national territory, the French firms benefit from less expensive l"électricité of Europe.
De ce fait, every significant reduction on behalf of the nuclear one would generate a strong rise of the price of l"électricité, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.
One prices that a broad majority of French refuse to pay the surveys, especially as they do not show opposition of principle to this energy, show it.
Remind that the energetic policy of our country has allowed building an industrial path of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 resulting jobs.
Strongly exporting, it takes a galaxy of SME specialized on the international markets and makes them very creative of not dislocalizable jobs.
If France decided to go out of the nuclear one, it would be to sacrifice a good number of this SME reducing the 6 billion annual euros of French exportations as shagreen d"équipements and nuclear services.
What electrician would order an EPR conceived to work sixty years even though the decline of his manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve energetic l"équation, it must be admitted that there is not source of production d"électricité miracle, not more that are not of diabolic.
The development by Areva of little emitting solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, reveals the complementarity of the sources d"énergie.
For the nuclear one, to maintain the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France an Authority of safety that exerts an intransigent control and transparency on the existent central ones as on the building site of Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are lived of the same obsession of safety.
In a demi-siècle, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, is intervened in conditions of normal exploitation; it has remained without human nor environmental consequence.
At Tchernobyl, the conception of the reactor and unforgivable human mistakes have caused the drama.
To Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of an extent unprecedented that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will get out the educations of this accident, as it had made it for the two precedents.
Fruit of this move and of a cooperation between the authorities of safety, the farmers and the French and German builders, the EPR presents a conception making it capable of resisting such phenomena.
Even though it is considered by all the electricians anxious to build a central one, the stopping of his building at Flamanville would be a magnificent present offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF leaving them the free way to seize the supremacy in the inescapable development of the nuclear one.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energetic bunch for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let l"émotion, the dogmas and the partisan maneuvers dominate a debate also determining for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is the immigration a load or a luck for the economics?
The policy as regards immigration taken under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized under diverse corners -obstruction of the police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of the number, compatibility of this policy with the statute proclaimed of "country of the human rights" of France.
More lately, it is the administrative harassment that are the subject to the foreign students that has been the topicality, the minister of the Inside (to read Release of May 23rd) proclaiming at the same time that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waiters of restaurant".
But it is seldom only analyzed under the economic corner.
It is that there is on this subject a broad enough consensus between left and right.
On the right, the your has been given by Jacques Chirac that declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed persons should not be a problem in a country understanding close to 2 million immigrated workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can" not "receive all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as on the right.
For the two edges, the immigrants are perceived as a load for the economics and the French society.
The only difference stems from the degree of generosity which one will deign to grant in relation to the immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines itself to banalities, indicating that the codevelopment will allow solving our "migratory problem".
This idea of the immigration as a load, a problem, is maybe paying électoralement; but it is economically very expensive.
As remind it the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthetizing the most recent knowledge on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact in the migratory floods on the economic growth, the salaries and the job in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting the anaemia immigration the growth and harms the job.
The fears in relation to the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these risk to substitute themselves for the national workers, very particularly the little qualified, exerting a pressure to the fall on their salaries.
But the experience shows the national wage earners, exercising professions for the main part in sectors in shortage of job, that, in reality, the immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes.
The little qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the national wage earners, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training does not follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on the salaries
In the same way that a surgeon will have harm to work in a country that knows a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between national and migrant makes as the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and the job of the national ones.
Giovanni Peri thus has calculated that a rise of 1% of the migratory floods leads to an increase included between 0.6 and 0.9 % of the real salaries in the long term.
And it without setting counts the fact that the diversity brought by the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economic growth (strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the prices Nobel American; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).
The migrants are as contributeurs net of the social systems, on average to height of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The world Organization of the esteem work for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving to the age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (receipts less spend) of 150000 euros to the public budgets on average on the unity of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of mandate, to go to look for the points of growth missing "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, being used to dissuade the immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented the democracy, stays to think the European democracy
The democracy is a pretty precious one; it is also a pretty fragile one.
The European continent owed to be able to remember it it that, to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has known at the length of the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, of the totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that it would suffice, so that the democracy triumphed definitively over his enemies, to exercise the vote, and of training it in the way the most direct that is.
One knows, for Napoléon "the Small one", that it was there a matter of an easiness of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of the democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even make "instrument of oppression" to itself as called in the past the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
Not, the democracy requires more well: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, of the Lights, of the economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis of the Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is both first a crisis of the political one and democracy very as much.
The palinode of the true-fake Greek referendum will have had value of revealing copy to this consideration: that of the necessity of a powerful return of the political one, but also that of the disturbing feeling of his impossibility, of his incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the lines head-on of the democratic fighting today have moved itself, and that, for many of them, the republican soldiers do not get out more to the good direction.
We do not have anything to improve at requiring a succession of national referendums, organized to the liking of the necessities and in unsystematic order.
A signature to a blank document to the European absolute monarch or a jump at feet joined in the space of the nationalist fold: what a choice for the citizen!
Not, we do not want cleavers but an exercise, common, of full right, serene and continuous, of the choice and of the democracy, this time at the European level.
There are not crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in the Portugal - moreover one would not know where to stop l"énumération anymore - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the very whole Europe that submits to the diktats of the markets and of the agencies of notation, which suffers from his impotence and from his defect of solidarity.
It is the very whole Europe that is humiliated on the international scene.
One worries about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the very whole Europe that loses his sovereignty sweetly, and with it each of his nations.
The urgency, it is to return the piloting of the European project to the popular sovereignty.
Because it is a unity, that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, they free themselves markets and they prepare the future investing.
The exit of crisis will require decisions at the European level that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimity, except of course to drive us to the disaster.
After having long fought this suggestion of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everybody asks today for the European economic government.
Is.
But to think it without a political and democratic integration stronger, and lived as such a by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock.
We must accept a new stage of the European building.
To be the Republic in France, republicans have had "to be "made".
The Revolution in the interests could not meet it.
This valid rest lesson.
We must build a Europe more integrated on the economic plan.
That will be able to be made only building a more democratic Europe on the political plan, a real European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, make Europeans.
The cards to flea "without contact" spread
The world lounge of the card to flea opens Tuesday to Villepinte, close to Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should end indeed on a rise of 11% of the world sales of cards to microprocessor (bank card, tells with card SIM...), at more than 6 billion unity, according to the office Eurosmart.
The more carrying segment is that of the technology without contact that allows paying the transports in common or settling his purchases simply approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million cards to flea without contact should be sold across the world, against 320 million a year earlier!
Their part should still progress in 2012 (580 million unity waited for) and represent close to 10% of the global market of the card to flea (6,925 million cards).
Long at the train of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe wins from the ground for the payment without contact.
About 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 terminals of payment accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the hypermarkets put the double mouthfuls.
Carrefour thus has emitted this year 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To be taken superior to the speed, the banks must equip their customers henceforth.
"Two great French establishments have engaged themselves to diffuse in future systematically to their customers of the equipped bank cards for the without contact", announces Gérard Nébouy, chief executive officer Visa Europe France.
The banks test the payment by motive
But it is only a first stage to the means of payment of the future: the mobile telephone.
Few devices are today equipped with the essential technology NFC (Near Field Communication) to carry out transactions.
"They have fallen behind".
"But they should finally experience a real flight next year".
"We count on the sale of 80 to 120 millions unity in 2012 in the world", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take owing them.
The agricultural Credit has announced yesterday the launching of a test from December to next June to Caen.
The iPhone of about 200 customers and colleagues will be equipped with a case authorizing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a project similar to Strasburg and Marseille.
And the general Society, it also, has said yesterday to prepare the bet on the market of an offer allowing his customers to pay without contact with their motive.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist forehead spreads
Paris worries about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Suspected of long date, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian vice-ministre of the foreign Businesses, Abdelkader Messahel, has even maintained that Algiers has henceforth "acquired the certainty".
"The way whose two organizations occur and whose cooperation the relations of the services of information show there is well", has explained without more precision.
Paris seems to make an analysis similar.
The inquiry on the abduction of two French in Niger in last January would have put bridges at the day.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by close relations of Aqmi, Antoine of Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the day after in same time that several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special strengths.
In the rubbles of the intervention, the French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephonic fleas belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the past calls directs to several interlocutors based to Mali, to Niger and to Nigeria.
According to France Radio International (RFI), two numbers interest particularly the investigators: one leads to a Nigerien who has stayed in a long way to Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other one to a man that tells to itself near of Aqmi and of the sect.
"It is an overhang but it is needed to wait no doubt for more formal proofs before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"One knows for years that the sect benefits from exterior financial and intellectual supports and that it appears more and more active", tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These last months these "supports" had been more and more evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his operating fashions, that imply henceforth the resort to kamikazes or to more and more complex explosive devices and similarly invoice that those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin through Washington, has made pressure on Abuja ever since so that it takes into account the problems put by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities long have considered indeed the group as a community of illuminated little worthy of interest.
A fast success
Founded in 2002 at Maiduguri around a mosque, of a school and of the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - who means "the western education" in Hausa "is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association knows a fast success.
She politicizes and requires a strict respect of the sharia while his militants engage the fight against the impious central government.
The latter aim first at the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram appear particularly active, multiplying the attacks on the police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as to his habit, without shades.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead men.
Mohammed Yusuf, alive order, is killed in prison.
Ever since the sect is going to radicalize itself and leave his fiefs of the north.
At last Noël, it claims an attack that makes 80 dead men to Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram blames the reassured QG of the police during a suicide attack, her first.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations will be his first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail of the Mauritania in Somalia going by by Nigeria worries henceforth all the specialists in the safety.
Then that Aqmi has surrounded Mali and the Niger, which the Somalis of al-Chebab operate on in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a maintenance in Nigeria with the president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and has told loan to itself to share all the information.
The world according to the republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on the help in Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are equal in simplism and in ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, indeed simplistic ideas?
To listen to the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
From some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others multiply the thundering declarations and the short cuts as regards foreign policy, traditionally a republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on the help in Israel, the slogans - often not supported - ring out.
Mitt Romney, the one better put in the race to the nomination of the "Great Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese owing OMC and to question them "for handling of their currency", a carrying theme in an America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of his industry to Asia.
So much worse if that must imply the release of a commercial war, it has said.
Jon Huntsman, ex-ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, has nearly strangled himself in view of an attitude that "flatters" the emotions.
He has called muscular but constructive to a dialog with Beijing (the present position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military touches on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he has boasted."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He has also promised to increase the military help in Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations in relation to this partner.
The contractor Herman Cain, second candidate the better placed one, displays as for it an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Lately, it called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China holds the military atom for 1964!
The texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants touches against Iran, is called ready, as for it, to encourage the American army Mexico against the cartels of the drug.
The resort to the torture against the presumed terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy truck talks about politics foreign country.
The adversaries of the present president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that it has won the cold war.
They remind that Obama itself was an amateur and that he has had to put water in his wine as regards antiterrorism.
They stress with reason the failure of his naïve dialog with Iran, on the too fast departure of the "boys" of Iraq, about his equivocations in Libya, giving him thus a label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers rather positive the assessment of national safety of Obama, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
From Iraq, she mistrusts from the military interventions that drive to the enlisement.
And, accusing that America must be reconstructed economically to resuscitate his supremacy, Obama strikes fairer.
The North Stream, portal news of ntrée of the Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, connecting directly the Western Europe to Russia passing at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has gone in operation.
It must supply gas for the equivalent with 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with splinter.
More than 500 guests of which four heads of state and of government have participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of Baltic, between orchestra and thin sideboard, to the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly Russia to Germany, under the sea.
Symbolically, the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte have turned unity stealing it of the valve ordering the entry of the Russian gas in the west network-European.
With this new gas pipeline, 27,5 billion additional cubes meters of Russian gas are going to happen every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km connecting the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklembourg-Poméranie.
A second tube must be finished thin 2012, allowing issuing altogether 55 billion cubes meters of gas, or the equivalent of all the French consumption.
And one evokes already the possibility of building one third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and in hour of this enormous building site has airs of victory.
The project had strongly been contested by Poland and the Balt countries.
The North Stream is indeed going to allow delivering gas directly in Germany, avoiding every land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to weigh on Russia threatening to close it the access to the markets west-European.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream with a "new germano-soviétique pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Staline to occupy Poland, in 1939.
Saying if the subject is politically sensitive is.
Western Europe, bringing his support to this Russian project, has improved it a greater safety of his supplyings.
But it is at the price of a weakening of the Europe of the energy, since the project has created a breach among Europeans of the East and of the West.
Russia has known, in five years hardly, to make to triumph his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, strongly consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us in an organic way", has confirmed François Fillon inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating to what point the great gas contracts are as political as economic.
All that explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, presents in number at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The building of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploit.
The underwater tube is in steel sheathed from concrete in order to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, dating minefields of the Second World War have had to be avoided.
"A hundred has had to be taken or be destroyed, by precaution", indicates Jens Müller, spokesperson of the society Nord Stream.
It has been needed to multiply also the measures to protect the faun and the flora.
The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 turns Eiffel, which nothing interrupts on all his length: neither valve, nor station of maintenance.
A platform of control was predicted off Sweden, but the persons in charge of the project have renounced it even though the Swedish were little anxious to see a society of Russian State set up permanent employee in way off their coasts.
"In the event of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than one minute ", clarifies Jens Müller.
In the event of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes therefore to the air.
But this case is considered little probable by the builders who have foreseen the welds to know an escape every 100 000 years.
The surveillance of the state of the gas pipeline is assured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for the exterior observation, as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
Of the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, width of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
À L'arrivée, after three complete days of journey to the speed of 3 measure second, it delivers precise information on the possible distortions of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been conceived to work fifty years without having to suffer the lesser repairing.
The circulation of the gas is simply insured by the pressure.
It is of 200 bars to the departure, and of 100 to the arrival.
Five societies have united their strengths to realize this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parts.
Have joined with it the German ones E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Sweat (9% each).
These five societies have created a common firm, appointed Nord Stream, responsible to build and to make the gas pipeline.
It is based at Zoug, in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has rented afterwards to this society, for twenty renewable years, the whole of the capacities of transport of gas.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever is the quantity of gas really transported", clarifies Jens Müller.
The financing of the building of the gas pipeline has been assured to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works should reach the 7,4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Sweat, for example, the investment has amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure about fitting in their expenses, since only Gazprom accepts the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast hammered with pines.
Of the valves, high of 4.5 meters, form the exit of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and the specificity of the gas that happens, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubes meters of Russian gas at every hour that goes by.
At full capacity, they will be 3 million by hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a notebook of brand.
Created it is a fortnight of years by an Italian firm, the Moleskine wants to return the taste of the writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, of hours spent to write in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with his black rectangular blanket, his elastic, his leaves of a white color broken, as aged by the time.
Nevertheless, the Moleskine notebook such than one knows it today is born... in 1997.
The Italian firm Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at that time to throw a notebook of bills design but distinguished.
Married Sebregondi, then consultant for the firm, takes care of the launching of the new product.
The notebook an old technique of production inspires, the mole skin (skin of mole) who refers to a varnish cotton used to cover banquettes for example.
This type of notebook was very taken of the writers and of the travellers.
"Moleskine has replaced up-to-date an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-gardistes artists, up to the XX e century", tells Maria Sebregondi, become from the person in charge of the brand by Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales have increased in 26% to settle at 12,7 million past parts.
One is far from the confidential production first years, that only 3 000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult of establishing a portrait-robot of the purchaser, because the notebook of bills seduces the businessman as well as the student and the professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, his consumers are cosmopolitan, open of mind and cultured.
The small Italian firm, which counted 12 employees at his beginnings, counts nearly 100 today and has two offices for 2008; the one in Milan and the other one in New York.
She distributes his notebooks in the bookshops, of the Fnac to the small stores of downtown and has known to impose his identity.
"We have followed the air of the time and this new need of writing, in spite of the flight of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development with Moleskine: lately, the brand has launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists display their own notebook.
In August, it has also launched a blanket in leopard, on the occasion of the Festival of the film of Locarno.
Taking advantage of his success and of this cultural aura, Moleskine has known to diversify his products: bags, agenda, pens, covers of computer... The brand is declined on a whole scale of supports.
A success that has made envious ones: at the autumn 2006, Modo Modo has been purchased by the Major fund of investment SG Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Does the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remain why so high?
About 19% of the handicapped people are in search of a work.
The 15th week for the job of the handicapped persons opens today.
In spite of a voluntarist public policy arrangement in 2005, the unemployment rate of the handicapped people is still two times more high that obtains it: 19%, against 9% for the unity of the population.
Discouraging?
"Not, underlines Éric Blanchet, chief executive officer of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the job of the handicapped persons. "
"The progress fulfilled for fifteen years is sizeable. "
"At That Time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times more high. "
"Nevertheless it remains still enormously to make. "
It must be said that for the handicapped unemployed persons, the obstacles are numerous before reaching the job.
They are rather aged: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a little high level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and on the 2,3 million students of the superior education, 10 000 only are handicapped persons.
Finally, the unemployment of long duration is very widespread: 53% for the handicapped persons, against 38% on average.
In short, as many criteria that complicate the return to the job singularly, and that "constitute the knot of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, chief executive officer of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the firms to recruit handicapped workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
Rest the one non-says, the mentalities that evolve, indeed, but too slowly.
A study realized in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the City indicated that the questioned managers have "a level of weak knowledge of the handicap", with one" overrepresentation of the people in rolling chair, of the psychological deficient ones or intellectuals".
Result, the firms deprived of more than 20 wage earners are still far from reaching the objective of job of 6% of handicapped workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The last well known numbers, which date back to 2008, state a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now around 3%", indicates White Stone, chief executive officer of the Agefiph, the organism loaded with collecting the contributions of the firms that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "taxed", all as the versed amounts, have reduced between 2007 and 2011, passer-by 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and of 606 at 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has created a strong pressure on the firms, explains White Stone. "
"But this improvement translated also a true awareness, in particular in the great groups. "
According to the ministry of the job, only 59% of the establishments of 20 to 49 wage earners use workers handicapped, against salaried 82% of the firms of 100 to 199.

Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure that this match obtains for them friendly.
One will not go up to writing that it was of the connivance between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sat side to side on the platform of the auditorium of the Stadium of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace well and truly.
Five months after the gesture in the mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praises to make to his subject.

As for the contrastre between his benefits in club and in selection, "it is a whole, it is justified itself."
"In Lille, I am the whole year, what is not the case with Belgium."
"It needs that I take my brands."
Handled carefully against Romania Friday night with a view to this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint Denis finally "to sparkle".
Without omitting though the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, it has encouraged to them from the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"Always I have been a supporter", it asserts.
Inevitably, that participates to reinforce the character "individual" of this meeting still more.
Especially as opposite, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rummy)", rapelle-you him.
"One has passed a little while ago."
"Being able to play against them, it is only happiness!"
With good-naturedness, Leekens has as his part evoked of the "pride".
"Pride" of fighting "for a match of gala".
"Pride" also of noticing -as "neighbor" - that France has "become a team of very high level" a bit more than one year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has made a work of the thunder", he has been enthusiastic.
Even though Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see itself well share the airplane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians become big", it has underlined.
"One is building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You are going to realize during the neighbors face". That against France include.
Portugal very entrusting
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with much of optimist his return dam opposite the Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
To go it, the two teams had lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees itself, in Poland and in Ukraine.
For it, there is not the shade of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which it is to the levers since September 2010, is going to be qualified for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed minutes of the happiness only at 90.
But there are a match to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to unbolt.
Considering the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, him evident apparait that the games are not made.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than one hour, indeed, but marking this so precious goal, which would have relieved it, has been incapable.
"It is a good result, which comprises though some risk because we have not marked goal at the outside"
But at their places, in their luminous Stadium of the Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are persuaded to go by, in front a public that should be there as boiling, even if the part looks evidently very gripped, dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but totally we are persuaded to be able to take the top", has declared the trainer Portuguese of 42 years.
"We continue have 50% of chances of being at the Euro 2012", nevertheless has relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The none brought back Friday of Bosnia obliges to the Portuguese to stand out and to win.
One none can suffice to the Bosnians, which have them also need of standing out.
"It is a good result, who comprises though some risk because we have not marked goal at the outside", regrets Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and that has players with many individual qualities", it has added.
As to Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of putting a maximum of pressure of entry on the Bosnians in order to not "not to give the time of thinking to them. "
A good idea, to condition of appearing realistic, this time.
