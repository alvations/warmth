The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies need to struggle against spin in the elections.
However, in the centre of the native believe the last myth, saying that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
In addition, Republican Lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for 10 years.
One thing we can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for the federal elections in the United States.
This is why most of the governments of the states pass laws since 2009,, process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has brought a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only for one 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 2011 was taken 41 state.
new election laws require voters to produce photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting,, right voter registration day expression and undercut the citizens who have the right to vote.
before the 2006 elections, not a single American state insists voters show photo identification.
INDIANA became the first state, who introduced a similar requirement.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, enacted in Indiana in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to spread this practice and in other states.
In the last two years they have initiated bills, forcing voters to produce photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec American citizens do not have universal ID, such as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, there are 21 million people, under the required age, do not have photo ID for voting, given the government the authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
The cost of the required identity often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people easily less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
But that is not all.
students are eligible voters, who, as is, to vote for candidates from the Democrats, and in several states are not allowed to use the ID card with photo, issued their educational institution.
But these same states permit members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote in mainly for the Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
until 2004, no, demanded evidence of U.S. citizenship for voting.
Such a requirement was introduced for the first time in Arizona.
since 2011, more than ten states have laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
Obviously, these measures aim to limit the vote of immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have laws in 2011,, voter registration on election day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register.
This restriction was not without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign helped make in voter registration lists at about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a 17% fall in the level of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states, laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
During the 2008 general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance, were in Florida -- even though the last were only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened and come from Latin America.
representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike White, which, by forming 76% of voters, only 46% among those who voted early.
of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters are actively against laws restricting voter registration.
several draft laws was Was governors-Democrats.
the most ambiguous laws was suspended with the intervention of the Prosecutor-General of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws requiring the charge of identity card with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules were in effect will, of course, the implementation of the election law in the 2012 elections.
criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them the obvious focus, to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The Centre of native from 2011 report demonstrates that states adopted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election of 2012.
Only one thing clearly: these new provisions will have negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the dog sometimes makes erroneous test results, and sometimes Sometimes лжепозитивные, which lead to To medical intervention.
men, and so reluctantly undergoing clinical examination, have something to hesitate, even more.
pass the test or not?
We asked two experts.
The research, conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups, so the data is difficult to interpret and it is hard to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European found different mortality in patients who were screened and those who did not take place at all.
The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the likelihood of a metastasis by 30-40% higher than those who have not passed the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to take from 40 or 50 years, test, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
The men of the black origin also are at higher risk.
The key is making the right decision, as only the cancer is detected.
cancer can be as aggressive and And.
patients need to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life, and making the choice in the long run, in these cases, in favour of active disease surveillance.
Today, many of the men, who have detected the cancer, treatment will take place, as their cancer not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We'll offer active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we can define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not be a course of treatment.
Therefore, I would recommend still to pass the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not, you need to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of urology,, created the tool to assess all the pros and cons of the test on the dog.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe, to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all great people were and del raco enough move, 30 per cent of cases could have been prevented.
"If nobody smoked, this figure rose would be at least 50 percent," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of the cases of cancer caused by its heredity.
several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
for the Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
and it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to the health of the people.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said press secretary Andre Beaulieu.
encouraging fact: Ten years after the surrender of smoking decreases risk of dying from cancer by half.
weight
According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
they increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
"research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," added to the association.
food
The Association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat.
in too large quantities it increases risks of colon cancer.
you should also avoid sausages.
shutdown by smoked meat, drying or Or, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The past can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explained in the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists were studying the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But the results of these studies cannot be clear at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed the risk of prostate cancer, another gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D is also full clarity.
Mr. Beaulieu stresses, however, that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."
<S> Higgs in detail
Last summer a message stating, that scientists may be able to detect Detect Higgs, caused a real boom-- and not without reason.
It is believed that this This explains a lot all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model, our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and behavior of matter-but which have never before been found experimentally.
But physics is not yet sure what he was talking about About Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it greatly resembles Resembles Higgs predicted the standard model.
In addition, the new data, presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems this is confirmed, although some data still lacks confidence.
it's all the same, that we are talking about About Higgs, as the chances of error seem minimal, and see what it means.
There are, in this world of one law absolutely inevitable, said that two things may not be in the same place in one and the same time.
There is no way around this rule, does not even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves.
But although the particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of similar nature: The principle of excluding Pauli, which posits that the two particles can Can occupy the same space in one and the same time, if they are in one and the same "elementary" is a "condition" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, share the particle physics on the two categories.
In one corner, we find a decent citizens, called Called wisely obey the principle Pauli.
In another scurrying around Around, a stark gang anarchists, who have no respect to anything-at least to this principle, which means that they may be used to be in the same place in one and the same time.
According to website (by the way, is completely extraordinary) particle adventure Berkeley lab, these These shared, in turn, to two groups::, on which we will not talk, and "force", through which apply the basic forces of nature, and which in some ways is Is Higgs.
These same Same, it should be stressed, not all exotic creatures, such as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, thanks to one incredibly Incredibly банальному::, or "light", which is "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with the electrical charge, or changes direction, it "violates the" electromagnetic field in this particular place, like stone, now in a pond.
"violations" is born of electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is no more than a A-and, therefore, one of the The "vectors of force."
more stable field
The same is happening with the The Higgs, with the only difference that, to this This appeared, should be "violated" another field, the Higgs field.
But the Higgs field are much, much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to bring it to achieve very high energies, as if it was about About integrate, the surface of which could move only a very big stone.
So why do we need a huge particle accelerator, as the ring, which operated in the CERN large hadron collider, which with 27 km diameter!-- to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is useful also for explaining the relationship between Between Higgs and weight.
In fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will keep in the refrigerator.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact, have mass, while others (like the Photon, incidentally) It does not have.
So, what can bring "all these studies, asked Ms. Ms.?
in science, they are used to validate the standard model (CM), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the observations and forecasts see results.
In addition, some of them are eager to this divergence was because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (Ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates roughly 80% of the universe (ouch-Ouch!).
But until the CERN such disparities have never been found.
consequences
benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser in the Bell Labs research could not even guess what revolution to bring about their work.
they foresaw their applications in science, but no more than that.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at bell laboratories, where in 1960, the laser was invented, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous momentum) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget."
imagine...
and in addition, the application may be for instruments, accompanying the study.
For example, the same Same Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, though it wasn Wasn his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the The will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
palliative care is the best way to die... | "debt"
The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and is preparing the Bill at this time.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
"The debt" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. l. still lived alone in his apartment in In.
Cancer of the prostate,, within, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the orphanage in the palliative care Victor-- гадбуа where arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock to this it is impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease makes his work: incredible weakness, which does not own to go to the toilet and even to eat.
sitting at a table, on which there is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to eat.
He He, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medication, lead in the bath.
The courage before death.
"My greatest desire, cured me from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found the cure of this malaise.
"in life, we are taught that a man must pee standing up," says Pierre Pierre, a psychologist at the orphanage in the victor--.
regress to the condition of the child-for some an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the human ability to" live with the decline, "he said.
as, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events Events and in the midst of this decline.
patients who received palliative shelter Victor--, all suffering from cancer.
forecasts see them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms. and 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to see their children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I want nothing more in life," she said, before you allow to put her mask, developing breathing.
It is still waiting for her son's last visit in the coming days, recruited from Italy.
in the orphanage Victor Victor by groups of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is the palliative care, which remains, nothing more can be done.
to make death more comfortable.
one place in Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants in palliative care institutions.
This very little, given that sooner or later we all die.
life goes on in the best conditions, any possible, explains Dr. Christian Christian, one of the doctors shelter.
whether physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
dying, we agree to provide Provide wash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he will ask.
We no longer make diabetics control blood sugar levels.
and death is part of everyday life.
yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. X, who died today at night.
His son Son this beer in the legs late in the morning.
"We're helping relatives, as well as the patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care.
At the orphanage in the victor-- nor one day is similar to the previous one.
The 93-year old man, who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, settled on their chairs during the toast in his honor, die tragically young man for 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and And all to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," says a doctor Christian Christian.
53% of patients receiving shelter Viktor Viktor, come out of the house, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem is access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, the care is available, to ease the suffering of the patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
and some institutions, such as the victor-shelter Shelter and palliative care at home of the Montreal society, are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
It is this large gap in the system of public health in Quebec City that makes many doctors-palliative care experts fear the law,, there and help in suicide.
Since October manifesto signed Signed circulates in the field of palliative care, Dr. Dr. балфуром and Dr. Bernard Bernard and indicate their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Christian, Quebec health system effective, is not enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before they will be allowed to transfer to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my cases that I stop treatment, she answered me that regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.
with it, I said that my days are numbered!
powerful care
Dr. Dr. believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank doctors and nurses, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the palliative care team makes their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely the omnipotent in the struggle with the pain.
According to To Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to To in 8 percent of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, from time to time, or constantly.
can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
more and more patients who do not manage to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
patients suffering from pain, always speak with one and the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want I spent there", it means "I want me to become easier."
The creation of this report was made possible by the journalist grant from the Canadian Institute for Health research.
large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of the political parties and the Italian mafia experts day tell what they know about the colossal "system",, construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
"The industry", which is very costly to taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"Curiously, as this system just falls apart after they were put in the case of all means, Jacques Jacques jokes, MP and former Montreal police chief."
It is thanks to him, the scandal in 2011 as a result of the investigation, officials of crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, which Prime Minister from liberals, Jean, agreed very reluctant.
"The report Report found a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, is only one ministry of transport would maintain $1 billion on contracts," if some of the withheld their instincts to take share.
The Commission Commission "already Already two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "uncover schemes behind the individuals."
The constant fight against corruption, division was created in 2011
In the case of Of was created in 2011, continuing the anti-corruption unit, which entered a state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
and, in addition, the staff of the special unit "Hammer", which, after 2009, forced to "" cartel "Montreal, to stop pushing the value of the contracts.
In recent weeks there has been a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the franc Franc зампино ришару-the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
The queue-Gilles Gilles, recently retired from the post of the mayor of Of, the third largest city of the province of Quebec.
Suspect in In receiving bribes when they state orders.
In addition, the official accusation was charged with several service routes Montreal engineers and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Tony and Lino Lino.
The last blew up a bomb, after the inquest about the "system" of receiving government contracts.
In the next few years Years gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal, some intermediary, linked to the mafia, which, in turn, opened money Party mayor Mayor жеральда "joint Montreal."
In the 2000's,, замбито money right and left. He listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 million euros) to the various parties in the province, mostly liberals, who then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he had illegally collected funds for former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Nathalie Nathalie.
sewage value contracts, in which the victors
In Montreal, "" corruption system worked well.
Gilles Gilles, a former engineer for civil construction, described her in detail before the Commission: In the ten years he has received from construction firms of gifts, invitations in the travel, golf tournaments, in restaurants, on games of hockey and bribes in a total of $736 million in exchange for sewer contracts, which he overestimated the cost.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received on his paw,, account for 30-40% using fake add-ons.
then one organizer of the Party mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Mr. that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, dirty money. </s> </S> party cash
After these revelations of Mr. Mr. resigned in early November by Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Chantal was one of the first deputies in Montreal,, anxiety.
The mayor of district District-de-- on the east of the island, it faces with the 2010 sale of the municipal area, purchased for $5 million and And... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be started, "drives for For, allowing them to understand the operation of the system System ants, to stop Stop and identify those responsible."
This process it It as "painful, but it's positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation group and an observer, to avoid the return of dubious practices.
As we We at home.
regularly.
Jacques Jacques notes with his hand that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but especially his worry about the role of the "elected officials who knew about this", but not participating in the fraud scheme.
Given that the share of dirty money in the campaign finance in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of the reality."
The Quebec government donations to parties, but offers a limit to $100, according to him, it would not change the situation: "As long as we do not strictly restrict spending in politics will be dirty money."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of granting state contracts and financing parties: "We can Can go below; true to the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this history and casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Mr. calls on those who laughs, look in your own backyard.
"Paris St Germain-FC Barcelona!"
PSG this season you have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can-and the new dimension of the Paris St Germain.
The profits of the great players.
Next I I every day with them.
technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
and during the match, it is easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not Not.
From the outset, in the heart of the preliminary preparation in NIF Nif I always strode forward and before my arrival in Saint-Etienne.
Thus, you benefit from the competition, by Carlo Ancelotti...
not new in the replenishment of this summer to play matches very high level.
and they also know that every training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player such as I, eager to be on level and mailed out to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
to help deputies, such as Claude Claude, who played in the same position that I have.
Carlo Ancelotti, the position?
of course.
Ancelotti commands respect across the technical staff.
Today, in the first league does not equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs.
He worked with such great players.
I think he will bring new titles in Paris.
In January, I have a conversation with him was Was.
then I wandered away from a series of injuries.
trust me, which he has also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season, Paris St Germain?
In the first league of Lyon took the US leader.
But we remain ready.
one of our main objectives is Champions League: We qualify in one eighth finals.
What is the goal of the Club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.
First we want to finish first in our group, Porto, to have the opportunity to take the return match in one-eighth final.
whether PSG to be first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and secure long-term position.
Today, it is not so.
Financial and Paris St Germain have the means, to make this project a reality.
not to take in the first league title last season, will be a major failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we actual earnestly want to win this title.
last season we were close to it.
In May, it was disappointment, because we have all, to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
we finished with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be in order.
Despite the fact that such a strong team, joined in the fight for the title as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think, that we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troyes and we still find that That, of course, it is a little frustrating.
We wonder what the people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the project.
The team is formed from time to time.
We have proved in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.
look at Manchester United, which has two season fails to pass in one-eighth final, even though they have spent huge amounts of money too!
Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of you to winter Winter.
It would be a disdain for our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new Paris St Germain.
It shows how fascinating first league.
I hope that, in May, we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of the Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, if we say that there is a "". "
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is a star of the first league.
wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and star on a global scale.
In a group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people that surround it.
What he did, it's really only.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you have Euro-2012 team from France?
as a disappointment.
I earnestly wish to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a bit of game time.
I have seen many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I can play a good qualifier matches.
This is something that I have had since my baptism of blue.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now have to behave well.
What do you think about the first months led Didier Didier blue?
They are successful for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
strict coach, he is close with players and inspires victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.
Blanc has reached his goal, he qualified US in euros.
I hope that Didier Didier lead blue in Brazil.
A good honored draw (1-1),, 16 October in Spain-is a fundamental match?
The match gave us faith in themselves.
each fought for all.
Prior to this shock in Spain, there is no such matches in my career.

each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
The only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction, signed, using encryption with the double key system.
The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, perhaps check that That used in the transaction, there really are in public accounting book Book across the network.
A key stage in the registration of new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of the mathematical tasks,, computers, decided that, as a central bank, receives privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the phase of hashing file, there are large file conversion to digital signature, short and unique.
Computers are "a new transaction and add to her room, before" "" all together.
The aim is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros in the beginning).
As this number is found, other sites easy to verify that it correctly.
The transaction thus turns Turns related chain all other transactions; any modification change digital signature.
If the purpose of cheating a user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wished to pay one and the same money twice, was only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network and the other remained unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, undertakes the task gets 50 50.
to avoid inflation, regularly award is divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
However limited number of Of in 21 million, but they are divisible to one One, that leaves the reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the computing power.
The network has already experienced ups and downs.
websites providing Providing, were attacked, and services Services were stolen from the reserves.
"the defect is not used for the protocol," said Pierre Pierre, who recently launched Launched-- network payments using real money with company regulations.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this service.
But the cash also have this flaw.
major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as As blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and And Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger, speaking the book and found that nearly 80% of Of are in circulation.
"giant sell" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," glad Jon Holmquist,, that conversion Conversion working in gold.
Pierre Pierre, another author of the currency benefits, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating network.
his system,,, is the equivalent of the credit card (in the real money) or contact-less payment via mobile phone, but it uses Uses for check transactions, so is cheaper.
The winner of the better control of your personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not need to install the new devices or software.
It is enough to address, which can be "photograph and recognize" phone, clarifies Pierre Pierre, reassuring that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency of the revision of the hierarchical system in favor of a more horizontal.
"before the The settles itself, will take some time, but 2013 may be the turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, by the way, to a variety of risks, considered today elevated, in case of success of this system.
We have gone from Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left its zone of responsibility in Afghanistan ((каписа).
NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, hoping only to us.
We have suffered in the mainly Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists.
and we will, with 88 killed soldiers, wounded and And.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, the former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of foreign forces, as it was under the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their own traditions, old and archaic, even if they join the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they no longer will, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
withdrawal of French troops from the base Base, who I watched from the hills Hills almond trees through the French Credit, took place in the order.
convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by reached Kabul, not being attacked by helicopters.
With the end of 2014 there will be no invasion of the Taliban in Kabul.
circumstances have changed since their irresistible advancing from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, the country was in the fire and blood from the struggle between various groups.
taking control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid bigotry these peasants, in which their surpassed al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our days.
former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, exciting public lands, to resell them under construction new returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontract.
They even discredited; the majority of them, by the way, have not fought.
as I heard in the countryside, people want a government that was not from the thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed the American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
In the modern world they lived in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated it.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; now there are 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
public schools in the cities are filled with, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who do not want to return to To old parties, nor to corruption of some leaders.
all, including armed militants, like mobile phones, TV and Turkish soap operas, which are the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army there.
The government, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
The old, overland anti-Soviet commanders, already taking measures to restore provincial guards, who would not obey the central authorities.
Afghanistan, mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent Extent, on the model of the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the election, a pause in April 2014.
But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry was on its feet, nor one dam does not function, no No system is repaired.
All imported; nothing, except for fruit and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
in a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
This has only strengthened the feeling that western countries were there only to their capture.
without energy for iron ore processing or copper on the site, without the means of transport, to export through the mountains, there is the extraction of mineral resources.
The Chinese are already almost left the copper deposit months Months, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the most major employers in the province.
It is also necessary in order to one day an Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent, depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new agreement provides for the preservation of the traditional aid: French language school for girls, boys, the faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
since 2009, in an effort to win the "hearts and minds" and meet the impossible task of combining aid from offensive operations, civil-military activities "service (CIMIC) at the Ministry of Defence, was abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of local labor, could help to contain the uprising: irrigation, drinking water wells, the restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection, and increase of arable land area.
that we will leave the memory of spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget promoted the improvement of living conditions of the local population, often very harsh in these valleys, located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural work emanating from local communities in Kapisa.
to get rid of the uprisings, U.S. foreign groups, which want to farmers, as they told me, you need to give them a little involved support, which would be well controlled and came to him directly.
The birth of the constitution of Egypt
It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play the Wa-bank.
surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.
For two years, as Egypt is based on preliminary text soon, in which several times were amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "violate the word" and "flout the law."
his followers in the camp are sure that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
a very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon its intention to explain the Egyptians, the article after article text.
It is also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with US weekly time.
The more that the call for accelerating the voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "or buying our products you vote for my text, or I leave himself emergency powers", which, it is believed, will be completed after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, yesterday voted for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, where they slapped a door, feeling unable to convey their views.
Human rights advocates, religious minorities or civil society representatives did the same.
that the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants have been hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to fellow Muslims.
It is no wonder that, in most cases, the articles were Were unanimously.
commentators, amuse, by the way, the fact that one of the few disagreements arose around day... time for prayer, because some members of the Committee thought that the clock of the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.
The text, which was the vote yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, Article 2 in ultimately remained identical to the article of the constitution of 1971, reading, that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the major requirements, had hoped to replace the "principles" of the "rules" that would enable them more rigorous application.
for Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect to other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy", say the Liberals, who see this as only a PR.
because, according to them, the Islamization of the constitution is through other articles.
They point out in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University advisory role, in particular in regard to verify compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Sophie Sophie specialist in Egypt, it is alarming, "people, to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see a theocracy. "
many liberals, in addition,, fact that the rector of the university, seems to be much less moderate than the current.
"At the moment there is no particular religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
most of the lawyers who have worked on this text is not Ulema and people with a university education, some trained in the French system, "reassures Alexis Alexis, which is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around article 220 ambiguity can arise, as used in it terms borrowed from the religious language.
This applies in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence-PRIM Red].
and in the future may be wondering how civil judge competent to make decisions about this. "
in addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The brothers claim that significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers of the army.
in accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.
There would also be no illegal trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the association for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern over which they consider to be detrimental for freedom.
retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth non-smoking insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and particularly for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer says on the protection of women, emphasizes Emphasizes хеба, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word, which does not appear in the previous constitution.
While Egyptian president should act yesterday evening on television, protests are planned today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" and Moscow will: migrants will save money for language
While the deputies and human rights activists argue, that will give the law of compulsory language testing, fraudsters, who appeared in the country already "fake" certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come 13 million migrant workers.
for the most part, it is the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families remaining in their homeland.
The law, which entered into force on December 1, will each migrant labor to pass on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, and retail trade.
Over time, however, promised in the Federal Migration Service, tests will be obligatory for all visitors.
The lease will not only the language, but the Russian history and framework legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to confirm for receiving, and to extend work permits.
The one exception is only valid for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is the official language.
not covered by the law and people People get certificates and diplomas on education until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, "and the protection of human rights
The Board will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, points of peoples' friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
migrants will pass the tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centres were opened in Russia.
The initiative of the testing was also supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, managed to ask in the press question: many times and that it is, in fact, give?
What will change that knowledge of the language and for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, will meet representatives of the migration service, reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery" of labor.
Many say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, in Tajikistan, the head of the office of the FMs of Russia, Viktor Viktor explains.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
only 90 percent organized recruitment system will solve the problem of foreign workers.
The problems appear have migrants without occupation, education, not knowing the language, do not have a medical examination.
without understanding the language, I am sure Sure, future migrant is doomed to face with dishonest people, who under the guise of aid Aid "" "in a close Barak, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, induced on 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"at home they promise one thing, and on arrival they deceive, passport, not paid promised wages," confirms the head of labor migration management Ms Tajikistan Tajikistan Sharipov.
not Not ругайся!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, admit that not only know the language of the country, in which aspire to, but on their own and then write.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but the problem: few of the Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even Even primary education.
Even their families have nothing to feed the children, not to mention their dress, wear and And in school.
<S> to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.
It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, they confess.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
In respect of the law on language, human rights activists say, however, one important point.
The tests will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the no-exam will not work, nor the subsequent official status.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"welcome, or external entrance."
Many of the visitors claim that to get official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and all those same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
false registration can be done quickly and just 1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists, a citizen of Tajikistan Tajikistan умед.
"", do not be stingy with buy paintings. "
In the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that false are not only the registration papers.
several "sham" certificates of the language tests have already seized by federal employees.
fake paper printed on a color printer.
of course, got new owners not for nothing: Each of migrants,, thus facilitate that task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two times more expensive than an official test procedure: it will cost labour shooting of three thousand.
The fact that the main challenge in the near future, to protect the system from corruption, "crust" it was impossible to simply buy, and representatives of the authorities, and human rights defenders.
As long as the Government can promise to guest workers, not managed to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors do not know Russian, will be offered work in areas which do not involve active communication with people.
The Interior Ministry takes no market turnover of illegal weapons
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Interior of Russia offers to tighten law against the owners of the civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities on the recent incidents: press shots on weddings, when without victims, and Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov slaughter, seven people were killed as a result of which the press.
The police want to forbid wearing Wearing in public places and raise the age, from which you can obtain a license for the weapon-18 to 21 years.
The idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and counter corruption Irina yarovaya, and promised that the amendments in the law on weapons can contribute to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
In the open letter, which the authors-representatives of different public demand to reject the "senseless." </s> </S> organizations
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapon minimal, told the BBC Russian service lawyer-oxygen forensic suite Vasily forest rangers.

In the US, from fast food and supermarket
The office "McDonald" goes up to a quarter of all American teens
In the last days of America Corporation's wave of protests against low wages at Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's are "," Burger King, "" tacos Bell "," "" and "Kentucky Fraid Fraid."
So far, no one is predicting this wave in the ninth, a shaft or her destined to expire in the early stages.
shares of the support the trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
in addition to raising their modest salaries, which receive ordinary workers Walmart and a system of fast food, to the organizers of the protests is the establishment of trade union organizations in them.
As long as this sector of the economy Don Don reflect the trade-union movement.
46 cents in the year?
Stocks began last week, after the Thanksgiving holiday, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America has fallen orgy of low sales, annexed millions of consumers and sometimes accompanied by By.
In this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people all over the world, have left their jobs and And Corporation along with trade unions and left-wing activists, shops, whose product is counted on modest and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many underpaid workers Walmart Walmart only at work.
availability and range of goods made Walmart, one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods sell-off partly because little pays its workers.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, for example, the shortage of diesel or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" required to raise wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 US dollars per month.
the average employee Walmart Walmart 9.5 dollars per hour, this consumption can not afford, they said.
scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase Increase salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion.
It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If the whole Walmart Walmart wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the shop will get them to 46 cents more expensive.
For the year, they will spend on any; dollars more than now.
Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that the protest took place only in nine states and corporations have no No damage.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its point-of-sale devices made in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Corporation spokesman Dan Dan argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post, that jobs left "less than five" Walmart employees in total, and that the protest was just "another Another gimmick" slaughtering its union.
"free ticket!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target were not stores Walmart (in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore not yet), and "took" and other cheap restaurants.
Mcdonald says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn Didn even gives you a hospital and never pays you for honest work!
<S> Williams, a member of the City of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the Federal and New York legislation is Is dollars per hour.
fast-food restaurants it improves over time, but not much, and their rank-and-file workers receive on average in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How can exist in New York on such money, incomprehensible to me.
once through the "took" was almost a quarter of American teenagers who Who function for them after school, living with their parents.
few who saw in the main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly coming across in an interview with the "", who complain that should live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children.
On the other hand, the forum newspaper The Wall Street Journal, hangs a comment, the author notes that irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, that you're going to feed them.
Participants of the protest, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and beyond fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, have more than doubled their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that the fast-food sector trade union organizations were created.
American law prohibits this Administration to prevent and punish trade unionists ungrounded and layoffs.
On the other hand, the Administration rarely makes them life.
But a Union embrace fast food and difficult due to objective reasons.
One of the major turnover.
<S>
noisy protests took place in this day and a range of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day, McDonald's rally near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Council Williams, who says: "MacDonald's, that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you a hospital and never pays you for honest work."
Demonstrators have supported and other prominent Democrats in New York, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the city of Bill de De, insisted that "we must all join in support of fast food workers so that they have a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every new New!".
As New York Times has described what happened, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But it took only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of the quick catering, which employed tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is unclear whether this spark the flames will mass movement.
"As long as the fool the brain is secondary."
popular among fans of modern technologies with the subject of Augmented Reality in recently decided to take in largely through the prism of special glasses.
first summer at their annual conference, current model showed Google, and then it became known that the corresponding patent application filed in November and Microsoft.
But from our conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D technology in the laboratory Laboratory Microsoft Microsoft шарамом that points the company passed the stage for scientists.
attracted by the prospect of manipulation of them virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
tell us, please, in general, than your research group?
"We are human interaction with machines, but try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
As mankind in mass Mass on stage work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes Sometimes finger in them.
We want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, the standard Xbox and sensors Xbox Xbox is a step forward, and almost no one today without the The is not for sale, because all the interesting Interesting management.
"that still lies ahead of us?
"Despite the fact that the The had interaction at the physical level, much is still on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The improved data (the system gets more information), and the conclusion is not yet very.
We are trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional display systems on the basis of the various technologies, including Including.
We need to release a computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a more convenient form.
and, first and foremost, to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality!
- what do you think about voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate it?
"It's definitely not a panacea-raises the question of privacy, because they do not always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all of the types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own market niche.
For example, we had a project to control devices in public places, in the framework of which we thought gestures, but not over Over, and such being stingy, short.
The gestures were not the camera device, and And bracelet, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
He's big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristwatches.
But in general, the future is mixed, for example, the gesture control + voice type.
"This is how?
"For example, how can you ask me to give you this bank carbonated drinks?
you say and show at the same time.
"I usually just say.
Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
"You want to get users to adapt under what may or may not at the moment the machine?
"It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more precisely define the human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution for depth, it is very important.
"If you're talking about your work with the Xbox Xbox sensor, do you have any claims to the modern cameras?
The lack of resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation, from which you can work in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get Megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 to / from.
But it's not in the The themselves, and as a matrix and depth.
With the latest point of view all current technologies are not good enough for us-it adds the designers algorithms.
There is need to remember not only about a resolution on axes X and Y and Z.
It is also very important, the number of frames per second rate.
movements quite dynamic and current 30 to / with frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Stephen of our Our laboratory made touch sensor with adjustable delay processing-from 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
not all understand how this affects the interaction between people and machines.
I would be in my work was the equivalent of such a device, but does not require Require frames per second was more.
"and the number of cameras increase does not need?
"" currently have three cameras ", one of which actually-infrared emitter, and second, the reflected signal receiver.
But already the third camera is, actually, a sensor of the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
or exacerbate it, increasing the amount of payments.
It would be nice to create flexible similar to To, play with the curved location of cameras and see how it will help in determining the provisions.
"As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their points.
you don Don think that from the point of view of everyday use Augmented Reality glasses-it is one of the most promising technology platforms?
"of course, slob around all the time, holding a Smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the most tough option would be" restricted Restricted "reality, when the cloud-based platform you could switch from points on the Smartphone, the projection display and on everywhere.
points are very personal device, their strength (private things see weakness only you), and at the same time-restricted on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual reality objects together with other people.
"imagine for a moment that manipulation of the virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Tony from" iron man, "but an ordinary mortal.
there is one problem, which often indicate criticism of such ideas: No tactile feedback!
The hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
In his lectures, I often say that the amended reality is seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be additive tactile sensations.
So far, one of the most interesting tricks-use of second hand as a substrate for the image.
It registers perfectly!
But there is a technology that is really aimed at giving this "images in the air" "осязаемости several aimed ultrasound beams at a certain point, for example, where finger, gives a sense, but it is very weak-as if you blew on the PADS.
and there are the bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the toes is also promising direction.
"You tried to trick the brain?
to make him think he feels something like should feel at that moment, when he sees something?
"This is a good idea, we have not yet tried to do so.
There is another problem, which will have to fight for a long time-how to make human, physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is open, almost infinite-work and over the concepts of cross-country tracks (not in the clubs such as), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
Yet fool the brain is secondary, work is still very many years.
that's what makes working on virtual reality such attractive for researcher-many things in its infancy.

I think that the choice is small.
In fact, only two real planets that can develop at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute of State name Name Sternberg (projects) Vladimir Vladimir.
But if conditions more suitable for life on Mars, the temperature on the surface of Venus-500 degrees.

"It's like time was Was, but again, this is an experiment, and such research must be carried out," said Vladimir Vladimir.
After landing space rats appeared offspring.
But to approach the problem of duplication directly in space yet.
not an easy task.

"Because nobody on this question answered," says veteran Vakhtang Vakhtang rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just one year after flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.

On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.

The newborn is impossible, as an adult, put in a special experience costume for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will be vital.

Chief Security Audit: checking Schwartz-management system has failed due to the fault of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security Audit management, from an interview for the site Site
"The law will never be perfect, but apply it must correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have," commented on the current situation Kala.
such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of improper practice lead Peter Peter approach to so-called Schwartz-system.
The prime minister recently said that the The (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother audits are permitted-is prohibited or entrepreneurs?
"The law should be installed in any way and, if he does, and the prime minister can Can resist the institutions, which are required to verify and achieve the implementation of the commitments," concludes Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which it was associated public procurement legislation in both countries.
What, exactly, was it?
there is a parallel check, which we started in mind, probably two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the fact that European law says, how should be public procurement, the national legislation, and then also apply in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even when the still unfinished audit revealed some interesting differences-to put it simply, the legislation we have can be "accurate and unmistakable", but in practice we in certain parameters behind Germany.
It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, should focus on the application of the law itself.
but actually this project can help you, what it means for you?
Such joint control can contribute in efforts to stop the precise laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
economy means getting the appropriate things for a reasonable (but not always) price to avoid low enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
but not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps this system System "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than it would be if the restriction is not dropped.
you're talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
and how the control system operates in Germany?
is there such an organization as our security Security (kru) or is it works differently?
As regards the institutions, as our chickens there is the The, arranged according to our principle, there is also the Board, working a bit differently, but mainly in both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers are alike, but to a certain extent because Germany has federal structure, there are divisions of the audit and the level of federal lands in their system is different from our own.
<S> can only manage the federal money, we have public funds.
public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the federal level adding chambers.
As for the local legislation, easier than we have there?
In general, I would not have wanted to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can take for example, but you cannot say definitely that it better throughout.
This is because they are better at dealing with control?
Certainly there is no such comparisons, but, I repeat, I do not like.
But I must say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected in your establishment of the amendments to the law on government procurement, somehow manifest consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments very short, it has not worked in our control.
As we have control over the fact, you need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account in the preparation of future inspections, we have started to use our new "risk Risk detection tool", through which we were taken away almost 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will come, because the conditions change change restrictions, some types of contracts and so on.
Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or additional load on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will.
The problem that may arise, such that the rules "", "and it will be impossible to comply with.
During the operation the previous rules controlled companies intertwined with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programmes-with the Regional Council) that any violation of the law on government procurement means in violation of fiscal discipline.
In such a case, the enforcement of the law in this way?
I do not think that this way.
The system should exclude those who wants to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit the formal mistake of not influencing the decision.
Such a system only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
and then how to get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path does not lead anywhere.
More recently, the Prime Minister said that it will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does this mean?
"Schwartz-system" is forbidden or permitted?
The law should be installed in any way and, if he does, and the prime minister can Can resist the bodies, which are required to verify and achieve the implementation of the commitments.
you can say: "we we would change this law and solve it," but you cannot say that we pretend that nothing is happening.
The public procurement law contains a fairly strict rules, and that must formally be, and this is right. This protects the public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but apply it must correctly, which, in my opinion, we don Don have enough.

Shimon Shimon: at concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than one month should come the end of the world?
This is just one of the many disturbing news, on which we, the people,, so easily.
together with a group of the tap tap, we constantly Constantly on this and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy, to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give a totally unique play three against the end of the world.
Could you tell us about the readers?
We are talking about a national event on fundraising, that we are here for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, the end of which declared on December 21, 11: 10.
The day before, 20 December in 21: 00 start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will fizzle out, roughly speaking, in the moment when Kiribati on the island in the Pacific Ocean, which timezone on 12 hours earlier than we have, to be completed in calendar.
who came up with this idea?
It was my idea, we all then further together with our artist Artist гонзой.
In addition, that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to get together with the public consider in what state the world we pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of May the calendar we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original objectiveness against the end of the world. These things can be bought at the web site Site-- and thereby also to help US support.
The tap tap along with other musicians also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
It already fancied listeners YouTube anthem at these These concerts?
of course, in the end, if it will all work out in the end and the end of the world will not.
his His all performers all concerts simultaneously.
hymns ring also live on Czech television.
lyrics to the song he wrote and played the role of Jesus in video Tomas Tomas, participates in the performance also Also X...
as you started to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts.
We actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many would like to work with us, they are interesting.
that revenue from the concert will go against the end of the world?
The purchase of equipment for For educational center Center, for the sixth year, we work with the civil association of tap Tap in the Institute.
teachers regularly attend school students of the institute Institute and spend with them fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have the means to go to the teachers, and thus we tried to give them this opportunity.
In the framework of the additional construction Construction Institute project in the future there will be a separate building in which we 4 with this project.
Each concert will be several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make the program, which will be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Will, Support Lesbiens Lesbiens with Dan Bart, the tap tap, Marjan Marjan and Jiri Jiri.
You can find out about all the details on the website Website
whether you are planning any such grandiose event "in the future?
In May, will perform on the "Prague Spring" Festival for the first time and then, of course, will make an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad have serious plans, you already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics?
It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric wheelchair, their stroller should travel in the cargo hold of, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with instruments.
Nevertheless, as we have done with this without problems. Czech Czech airlines and British airline British Airways were always well prepared for us, how many times he was surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems.
you can compare different countries due to participate in such races in abroad in terms of availability, public attitudes towards disabled people, and so on.
faced with at the moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have witnessed that in the East is still at the basic level.
Compared with the Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and here is still in the new independent human movement in the electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
also there in the banal things such as give way to the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there already are public organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
and what, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
in London and Madrid, it is normal that people with severe form of disability can move independently on the streets, to go to the toilet, the museum anywhere...
There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we with the tap tap them a little ahead!
respect for the public or Or is one thing, but at the time, when we will among sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really begin to change.
As long as this isolated cases of people with a strong will.
the currently very popular tap tap, but go back two years ago, that you made it in 1998 to organize?
I entered the Institute Institute as a teacher, I've had a lot of young people around me, who wanted something to do.
and because I am a musician and play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized interesting music circle.
Well, over time, as our leading Leading says Says, it is a little bit out of control (laughs).
The popularity has only in recent years, or I I?
It is true, we helped that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on propaganda group.
We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can appreciate, in fact as if there is no.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
whether your goal as well turn the tap tap?
from the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
in a show-business full of things, one another. </s> </S>
This is logical, all new accepted with caution, and lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural...
but this absolutely Absolutely pity, because people with disabilities are not any different and all abandoned by the individuals, which we must regret.
They are the people who can live a full life and, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities, it turns out, this shift not only for them, but for the whole of society.
whether the success that you strict head, what you think?
If we want to do the job properly, we must be many things line and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that this is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they hear that twice a week they must go to the rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But as happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the early in 1998?
only one One ладя.
we open a group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the will power, our door is always open.
He will be held for a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday Thursday at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the The,, Club in Brno and Ostrava in the centre of Of with 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities join Join at the moment of the song the band the tap tap "end of the world is cancelled."
The aim of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for multifunctional Multifunctional equipment for educational center Center Studeo Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert cost 400 crowns, admission is free for children up to 12 years. You can buy your tickets in advance in In.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland twentieth member of the European Space Agency was adopted as the second country from the former eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the European Space Agency (ESA) on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1994 and in the subsequent years actively participated in a number of projects of the agency.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiasts were flights to space, but it is not always seen with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, lectures and And, which on December 6, 1933, in Warsaw astronomical observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to cosmonautics."
The young engineer (1905) have left the audience, after several years of Of indifferent recalled that Dr. Jan Jan was only interested in his work.
In 1934, France France won the prize Robert Robert эсно and Andre Luiz Luiz for "introduction to cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Jan (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great he was astronomy and space science.
hundreds of articles he published in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books, dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
<S> became known world he was in space, and his contribution was evaluated in including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.
The Railway was built in 1925 in Poland already Already equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear, even for acceleration or braking rocket trolleys should be used.
Information about this era Era known only from the press.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to worry about missile Missile.
research section of the armament technology in collaboration with professors Professors мечиславом and Gustav Gustav.
of the remaining material, you can see that studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the advent of German troops were interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press the idea of photovoltaic missiles-fighter, which offered Offered engineer, and the next year was the work of the "air missile and torpedo aviation rocket-bomb" author Author леливы.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects of military use rocket technology was a scientific Advisory Committee ((Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo), which coordinated the entire work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to the aerospace, appeared in the Polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (polskie Polskie Towarzystwo).
for the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954, "problems", in which four dimensional magazine articles Articles.
In one of them, Professor M. M. offered to organize society, which will be Be.
At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is a promising industry.
Since the start of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (() has been trying to join the international astronautics Federation (founded in 1951), and already in autumn Autumn became its member.
and in the following year, the first chairman of the The Kazimierz Kazimierz (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
from 1956 1956 contributed to the development of highly successful meteorological rockets RM ((Rakieta), which became the first Polish missile Missile scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first run was held on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable to overcome the distance 1800 m, was 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, the enhanced version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 1959 бледовском two-stage RM-2 missile tests were carried out.
The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this research-RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was overseeing Overseeing wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The heir to the first missiles RM became the meteor-1 rocket, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 over the years.
The rocket was conceived as a stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight-- kg.
There are three types of (marked as Meteor-1A,, and And), which varied in size camera for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A rocket had space of 0.4, Meteor-1B-0.34 L, and Meteor-1C--.
The maximum flight range of all three types of was 37 km.
between 1965 and 1968, took place at the Aviation Institute Meteor-2 missile development, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 missile with the initial 380 kg was able to cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
then the meteor-- versions were built and Meteor-3.
We should also mention the accession of Poland to the Committee on Space Research (cospar) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee of cospar two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the The, Poland, participated in studies of outer space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Miroslav became the second Second after Vladimir Vladimir.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The decision has provoked a lively debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issues from a broader point of view.
The liberal-oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that separate economic units, national economic system, are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade, and free, but limited the movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labour (wage) price pressure.
Under this concept should understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods to persevere in economic competition, "is that" the cost of a competitor with the aim of taking a large part of the market and, therefore, increase their income.
in the massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labour, compared with other high.
because private capital has no social responsibility, including for made them growing unemployment, the inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance by businesses to pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social damage caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to bring specific statistics.
<S> methods of private capital are at the level of the economies of individual states, when governments are forced to enter into competition with each other, to artificially reduce the social level of its population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the Government give its population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
First of all, this is reflected in changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to economically to its Its ​ people to obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
As a result of the increased levels of poverty, and with it the difference between rich and poor.
in Germany for several years already, there is the public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves in their own work.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly cases occur, when employed people receive a salary that the state they must pay extra to receive subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
economic measures in almost all the southern countries of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people, under the pressure of the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on On salary on the margins of society, in the hope that private investment capital will come when something in the country.
But the question is, where will it?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, poverty move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for a fraction of the European wage.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to nausea, argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, that managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital has consistently insisted that the state should not management action to intervene in the economy.
Further, the question to be answered, not whether private capital, now almost managing policy, and to the entire state, in their own selfish purposes?
a definitive answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of a practically Almighty and omnipresent lobby in all of the states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation,, in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the public ministry due to lack of financial resources assigned to develop Bills private law firms that are associated with the industry.
Then these Bills the claims the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of a western-style, and from the powerful financial groups who own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly in such Such ​ situation, as it is described in In "crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and pompey": "The state had already split, and agencies are engaged in violence.
bribes, illegal favours with stones and swords.
bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice, ""... decent people are not candidates for the position of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul "...." seriously began to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for a vigorous man ".... thought, that this will be the pompey, but they became Caesar, that finally replaced democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by own reckless interests without regard to the public interest.
Private capital has already essentially not intended for public purposes.
The result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform the deeper nature.
It means that the root causes of fascist and Communist regimes, we should look for in a foolhardy liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a type of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next tour.
First of all, tragically, the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims, humanitarian and social disaster in the future, that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of the competition both at the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social population level.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the contribution of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and private capital will weaken the monopoly position in favor of the state in society.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Violence will not do, and can never get out," Sting, the song "fragile", where the main verse Verse are the words: "Don Don forget what we are fragile."
"If my sons would not want wars, their" moribund Moribund гутель, wife Wife меера Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused many responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing its position, that he has the right to self-defense, and that the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists and other support to the Palestinians, arguing it is racism of the Israeli state, genocide, perfect over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel ascribed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don Don want to speculate about who these periodically repeated waves of killings-perpetrator and victim, in the end, today's Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born on the current political situation, and were not witnessing the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve going for 95 years voltage (apart from signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning as historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first of all the history of the struggle for power.
Each time we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
that is not so clear is whether these people are completely independently take their own steps, or for their throne was someone, who has guided them to the pre-set goals.
We must admit that we are living in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power could not happen for the life of one generation arising out of them.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be viewed as the head of the Octopus (I do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded)--.
Many did not write about them.
of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop Rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher areas, and that has always been in the shadow of which they were to strengthen their power, multiplication of wealth, or simultaneously and and to another.
They have large shareholdings in almost all of the world's central banks, and are against the countries whose central banks do not have its share, they are or prepare war (until the invasion of Afghanistan was just 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi was only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has taken his country's Central Bank in your hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank for For Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own ((- Government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963, Deputy Luis Luis was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
their thirst for global power in the period from 1859, in 1871 a year has led to the development plan of the three world wars, created great Mason 33-level Albert Albert.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, and the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and a third should lead to the reduction of the world's population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (such number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power.
method, in which working group of the richest families headed by By, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao-order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which should prevent a recurrence of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war by killing Killing heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, inaugurating the Bolshevik Bolshevik.
The first world war ended with a sudden, grounded in the warrior and economically surrender Germany (there was no longer a need for war destruction Tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, a fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austro-Hungary.
To facilitate the launching of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations to Germany, rather than created the premise to a radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans strong enough Enough perpetrators and offers simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and indeed has the function of a fifth column of fueling the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the The branch saw the founding of the Zionist movement, one that sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
the Balfour Declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began the first clash with the local Arab population.
terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to estimate, released whether Hitler of chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or all of, what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state, the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was provoked by military Military on the first world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed a war, to create a home third.
If international bankers will start, the Jewish people, and in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now together with Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of the people on Israel's supporters and opponents.
who is to blame and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if all started with greed individuals and their commitment to global power?
Here we need to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers palm off people for voting in elections for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's Hawk is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to the international bankers, doing everything, to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and, given Iran's control over the The Strait containing 20% of all of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as lead to the destruction of the world economy.
in which light now are the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "all that we need is the general crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their view is the world masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy,, comfort.
The world body, where every born at birth Birth chip, with whom he becomes a, which is under total control.
"and makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have on the right hand or forehead on stigma, so to people, which is not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could not buy or sell.
here's the wisdom: each, have a mind, can calculate the number of the beast.
For it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
The film "Argo" "operation: When worse call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students demonstrators seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be freed in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Mohammed Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which have been patron of his regime for decades.
for the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation not meant as she could not afford to throw away the Shah for board, because it is at the root of the allies could undermine confidence in other countries.
But to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations brokered by the government of Algeria.
their fate has triggered a wave of solidarity and And sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election year, and ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, "Argo" "actor Ben Affleck" operation describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.
Shortly before the embassy occupation six workers managed to escape.
After the complex changes they finished their way in residence at the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to pick them up from Iran, helped an legend cover, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as well as members of the crew,, place for filming science-fiction epic in the country.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert "evacuation" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
The legend was reliable, in specialized magazines wrote about the project, was to hold a press conference, fictional film production company had real office.
The details of the operation were held in secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
This particular combination of several genres. </s> </S> film
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film Film", the story of a successful ensure, fraud-an example can be a number of films about friends Friends.
in the film are constantly changing the mood, on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran in a caption displayed significant historic photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film-the large differences in this is not).
On the other hand, lighter Hollywood passages, overlapping with irony and moderate exaggeration.
and then you have scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies-men in suits discuss the situation at the tables of the negotiations in the stairways institutions, on the phone...
Ben Ben wonderful managed to make. </s> </S> career
from From actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"operation" Argo, "his third feature film, after dark detective" bye-bye, baby, goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" The town "(2010).
At the same time, this is the first film Film, which starred in hometown of Director-Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of this place belongs to the qualities, which had elevated the earlier films directed by Hollywood standard.
Affleck is in "Argo," where Tehran "plays Canada.
The best scene in the movie are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events-embassy entrance scenes fall was its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and And, which arise when the suddenly changing history.
like the effect of Affleck and his colleagues are scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at a Tehran Bazaar).
too many processes in too many places.
the director had to deal with the fact that the narrative suggests many exciting scenes of cinematographic values.
He quite successfully works with this little, sometimes something Something-there's all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America to prevent a looming crisis in Tehran's airport, and the chase on the runway look pretty farfetched).
The drawback of "Argo" is the distraction associated with the show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues would really Really, but their characters deserved a larger space, and they are not alone in the film.
The film Film lacks a little dramatic, this film, which you can watch with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating the news of the seventies.
But the captures.
However, this is enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions about Almighty and And special services.
Rules inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The portal Portal, conducted a survey of the most grotesque bank fees annually, now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd or project from EU workshop."
"We made this last event, in which the EU intends to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said "law" organizer Patrick Patrick questionnaire.
Among the already put in nomination Nomination-the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have benefits on life insurance, because insurance companies they are objectively less prone to risk.
"People can propose further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Said.
It refers to controversial EU directives, and compulsory adding Adding in fuel, for example, that as a result of damage to the nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury Mercury only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive, or about the size of cages for chickens, resulting in significantly rose eggs this year.
also criticized was a de facto ban on the use of the term "" oil "or exemption from sales of traditional light bulbs.
quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.
The pan-European device often makes the decision under pressure or other commercial or industrial lobby in Brussels, whose positions are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat of veto stands for the requirements of the banks).
The lobby interests are top quality: bananas, for example, in the European Union should reach 14 cm in length and would not have dared to exercise "unusual curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission-was justified but that only harmonizes existing disparate national rules, which complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some member states, the same reduced standards relating to fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to To products.
A candidate to win in the poll may become EU last year's resolution, according to which sold balloons should contain a warning that children under eight years may not be inflated them without adult supervision.
The EU appealed to American research, in accordance with which the balloons in the game are the potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
that restriction now applies to children up to the age of 14, which prohibited in trade fair Fair blow.
Fun ideas are born and at home
It is absurd and rule on the European officials: anyone who has any official position in the EU, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
The portal Portal in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez faire), proposed to vote, apart from a few above absurd EU rules, for example, the rule about the amount of food on the territory of the membership of the state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, Czech Republic exceeded the volume of canned mushrooms, for example, installed, she faced a fine for that.
The questionnaire also interested and some countries to pay for the fact that they have no idea of the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.
The European Union will ask for compensation, "he said in the fall of 2004, then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
The argument, he pointed out that the country was a high grain harvest and, as a result of the so-called state intervention purchases had full warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.
The Czech Republic is far from EU ports, according to To, had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the Commission went to the Czech Republic, the tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
subsidies for receiving subsidies offered to villages, the ministry of regional development minister Paul German (US-DEU)), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go to the statements on subsidies from Brussels.
EU: bizarre orders are an exception
Although the Regulation in the member states can easily become the object of criticism, EU efforts at regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.
a serious problem, according to experts, is Is EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget.
emotions among Czechs and that, just as in other countries of the European Union in Brussels, Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific identification of their traditional products, and it does not always wins in this event.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austria retained the name "" cheeses, "but" "rum" traditions, which are rooted in our country in the 19th century, our manufacturers should rename the "". "
called the rum can only products from From тростникового, and not from sugar beet.
The official list of registered products in the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "German German горгондзола of Luebeck or Or ham, have proved to be, for example, Karlovy Vary strictly stuck Stuck Rusks and And carp and And hops.
EU trademark can also be proud of Of carrot and And tubes.
People want to I guarded Republic, but I'm a fan, "says Says.
Mr. Senator, as a man comes to mind to run for president?
I don Don think about how to become a senator or president.
If we all function without problems in the country, then I would not run anywhere.
But I can Can watch the country Country, how about the thieves in the last 20 years, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don Don like, then try to find a solution, as it is to change.
and since I was four years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of Senator or president.
In the Senate, you were, but soon went to the presidential Castle.
Don Don turn you thus back to the people that you chose?
all the time I said that That in the fight for the presidential Castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
My purpose is not to post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
so I have the greatest impact and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty not only in the fact that we as a nation have Have in a bar or TV, but are ready to trample any who try to change something.
mass media, which are added to this person Person and confuse freedom of speech freedom with lies.
For example, I said that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Jiri.
Let's get to your views.
The struggle for the presidency the Castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal liability politicians and back property declarations on the amount above twenty million.
To do this, we need to change the law.
You have no such powers as President, and only a Senate may offer laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours is free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is Is-when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately were being thwarted, and it is the citizens.
As an independent Independent person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party Party on art, without even glancing at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
You think of yourself as a man more relevant to the right or to the left?
with the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to me left.
"It is not important for me at all-a little to the left or to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
It is not about what someone who belongs to the right-wing, and someone to the left, I want to unite the people.
I always support any good for society, will offer his His or convenor, and I'll just against bad ideas.
you are angry, when someone says that you populist.
but do not prove whether you are what you said?
when you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
and you are trying to get closer to it.
You can call it populism, but all proposals on which I say, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of parliament, you will only slogans.
But with this you don Don hold for a long time in politics.
or do you think that when you get to people and talk to them, then you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public, and to try to entice them on their side, that we have achieved.
If I was elected president, not be problems to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I shall refer to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
and, in case of failure, they should tell you why this will not want.
if it will be a strong personality, which will outline the abuse, will be to put pressure on the political scene.
take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
I say directly that I'm a fan, and not an intellectual genius and not.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I just a beginner in politics, and for its programme to try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it can Can finish, six years later and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if If should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that I don Don do anything, so I bypassed by a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to To радиму, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
I also supported the leading journalist Jan Jan investigation that revealed at least fraud with light fuel oil.
I put forward my candidacy because people really are dissatisfied with, but now I feel myself in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people went to the polls, and most of those who went to selected members of the establishment.
We are independent only two in the Senate.
people have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be carried out.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
do you think about the basis of their own party?
I haven Haven thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I have no money.
There is no money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You have no money?
you're talking about property declarations, and what your own things with this?
personal property estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague, worth approximately 25 million apartment at 10 million collection of works of art, another 8 million apartment, about 10 million, Aston-Martin on the 3.5 million and Skoda microbiological laboratory million, and a few million on the account.
The Aston-Martin, I have appeared, because it was my dream Dream-I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant, a Charmer with women, and at the same time, fought against meanness and lawlessness.
you ride the Aston-Martin, own property at 60 million and you don Don have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money to invest in this do not want to.
This is not very convincing.
I don Don have 15 million on the campaign.
I must inject themselves into debt?
I invested 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program not so interesting.
and I am not obliged to pay for campaign contributions from his pocket.
spending on the campaign, I essentially cover Cover salary.
But the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son of an English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I wanted to make money, so would not run anywhere.
that means, you will be further engaged in business, it is possible to live?
did you not say that reduce this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partly reduced its activities.
For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like that I was Was, which will store the Republic.
But I also need something to live.
how, as an entrepreneur, you are used to on a monthly basis?
from two to four hundred thousand, that get further.
and if I become President, its business would be finished.
you will find the full interview in after the issue of the newspaper "right".
The architects Architects argue that real adventures are not only in the popular imagination-for example Example and his recently constructed book Mountain-2 photos
"To me it seems like fun, it looks unique touch panels, finally we have again, you can see something interesting," says Says лизетте верхайг at the edge of the road.
and Stefan Stefan, a specialist in it the located near a large enterprise, said: "No, this is a really beautiful building."
But I ask myself: Why do we need another Library today?
all have the Internet,, and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily walks in such old-fashioned library, right?
<S> спейкениссе малопримечательному town under the following ports: Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges, which depicted on euro notes, in the form of a magnificently painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
and then the city fathers have realized that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Pooh maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm Firm, master of bold can diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, took to the task with his usual combination of calmness and appeared on the contest audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.
and while the jury members repeat looked and shrugged, defiant maas pulls from his original gift Gift size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "book Mountain" in In, the so-called Called!
Nine years later, the mountain worth 30 million euros has increased.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes the underground parking garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "Gore's book" was awarded the second prize 2012 competition "the best library in the Netherlands."
The project involved wooden buildings in the Dutch national contest of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything, except the postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades which suggest the The, wealthier one contemporary work of architecture.
But the most important thing in In first appeared in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The Long Road to book
first impression: the book Eldorado Eldorado for cheese.
here only one elevator, held in the center of the architecture and reading, because the real fans would prefer to explore the area on foot.
<S> from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors made from bricks and elegant street lamps create a sense of public city square.
The city environment perfectly recreated.
view involuntarily looking benches, dogs and playing soccer, boys and girls.
and everywhere-books, books, books.
"usually bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a big dark room, usually a A and faceless," says of the maas.
We have a classic configuration space with legs on the head and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the offices, library, Internet chess club, ecological Centre and technical facilities.
especially compelling black bookcases, which serve as the finish, then lined the walls Walls railing.
their appearance, texture and smell the unusual.
Even experienced architects and engineers are lost in the or, what is the unknown material.
"We were eager to work with secondary materials," explains Explains йоп, manager of the project, representing the community Community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
and once at one agricultural enterprise in In we met appropriate agricultural by-product.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as lining under used artificial Artificial roots thick material thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
The textile is one-two of the season, then it can emit.
The library is the canvas for the first time in such amounts was Was in the four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Called (() turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, according to smell a little bit like a new car, and a bit of sneakers.
on top are 105 steps.
Anyone who breaks the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch Dutch and tree Tree in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the right humidity in the literary Mountain.
The costs of a new soul
"It is hard to believe, but it is building, in spite of the many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment," says Says.
heat is used for the heating and cooling of the earth.
Although the book Gore stands under the glass Glass even on clear days, the sun gets inside only briefly.
vast farms of Of wood perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take on much of the sunlight.
The climate in the room very pleasant.
The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Stefan mentioned above skeptic of the IT sector, already visited the new library.
<S> лизетте also was already here.
as well as Cynthia Cynthia богард of traditional Chinese medicine, which called Called "soul Soul, which not long enough."
The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of every resident received an invitation to sacrifice one of their own book.
These books should occupy empty space on the shelves were still not fully staffed libraries-at the time it was delivering books.
The idea worked.
shelves Shelves up.
"There is nothing worse than Than library," says the architect of the maas.
"I think that our invitation now every resident in some way associated with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
even if it is only for decoration.
Thus,, solve royal task, that professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
<S> wrote his literary history.
and even if they are very young and uneducated.
It is only the starting point for the development of identity.
Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role."
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow the diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians' application to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in the Gaza Strip.
Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position, it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence-not speaking too critical toward Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights.
In the end, NATO held this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is.
In fact, that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from policy which, so to speak, by the US, to the German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans have not agreed upon a common policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that until they are ending their role, but only on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.
such foreign policy, which is France, or the United Kingdom.
What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from a German point of view?
This willingness to take in its national interest, unaffected by the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from the exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests largely differ from the interests of the other large states, and why Germany must defend their interests.
whether these have economic interests on the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote in the United Nations?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the states of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it should be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
But I would not give it too much importance, it is not completely unilateral communication.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
<S> Germany its relations with the United States, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote about Palestine?
I am sure that prevails in Europe and even in the U.S. understanding of the German position.
So I don Don think that it was the same dramatic Dramatic, as in the Libyan issue.
Germany even will thus, perhaps, a certain respect.
It signals that it should be seriously as a player on the international stage, and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly voted for a veto.
there is a divergence of views between the United States and many European countries?
In the power of American domestic politics, such differences have always co-existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has sufficient understanding of the European position in the depths of our souls.
But the Government in connection with the local political situation, of course, could not take such a position.
I believe that considerable differences of opinion is not as significant, as always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama has not delighted by Netanyahu's policies.
Germany's easy to combine their ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the major partner in the EU, on the other?
I think that is what makes such a difficult situation for the Germans.
of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there is one, a consistent European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they may not be as part of a wider approach and are forced to act, instead relying only on their own vision of the situation.
This is exactly what they do with the euro.
In the future, I think that Germany will take the lead role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany, this is difficult, at least because of ties with Israel.
This theme was always fine.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player-not really whether it will take on the role?
or the leading role still difficult given Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, always hard is to play a significant role.
consider, for example, the euro crisis, every time, when Germany assumes the role, are the most various creation feelings.
The Germans Don Don just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don Don want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more precarious position than the United States.
It must take into account the different neighbors and opinion, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the USA in the European policy has weakened, but at the moment, the EU does not fill the vacuum, then who is?
The Germans just to play a more significant role.
Even if you don Don like it, unpleasant or strengthens the enmity to you-this is life!

"protection of trademarks in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is internationally well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is the Armani Polo?
It is officially registered name, that has nothing to do with firms in China, from which it established names.
Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be sued.
But even then it is unclear whether they can assert their rights.
"foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Thomas company Taylor Taylor, a lawyer specializing in violations of trademark rights in the far east.
on my desk every week appears on the new case of this kind.
<S> to add just a few letters, to achieve the right to register their trademarks.
from Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada, you can register Prada Prada instead.
The same way legally copied the German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
<S> opens the folder with the trademark office records in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered trade mark Mark DF puma, artificial name there, which used the name of the fashion house House Ermenegildo.
The Chinese world champions on copied and infringement of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities have many department stores, selling almost exclusively.
However, things are not such Such. on behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises was officially received from the office of the registration of trademarks, the right to use the name, which already is somewhere else.
The Chinese call it the "ban Ban", mark-passenger.
This word is associated with "ban Ban."
The so-called rich women who hunt for men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"It damages the business, with this, we must fight," convinced Convinced.
"brand Brand, a unique position is lost, the image is suffering too much."
financial losses and procedural costs in affected industries are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third-largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury items.
But to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
<S> tells about the cases in which the court rejected the claims, as well as at the end of a long time Time name became "the reality of the market."
Even if the complainant is unlucky, it will have to pay Pay, damaged his trade mark in China, "says Says.
Sometimes it is governed by the law of the jungle.
There is also the famous case of the graphic elements.
in 2009 the company Daimler lost a dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired Acquired manufacturer putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of the Mercedes.
Geely, Volvo Volvo ccTLD company initially used a blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; process was successful, Geely, had to change it.
The producer of fashion goods Goods Lacoste lost in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
The trademark registration in Beijing Beijing confirms that, in 2010, due to a lack of personnel and equipment problems took place there.
But last year was "the return from the emergency situation in the working process to normal."
So, the amount of untreated cases objections has decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost properties of such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless,, claims are still waiting for the production in the ministry.
to fight against this costly
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
in the past year in In received more than 1.4 million complaints about the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China, the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations in the world, the agency reported.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, for a total of 5.5 million units.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was paid fees.
If easier, it means that each check worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euros.
its appeal is worth many times more, as it shows the German family company freudenberg.
for more than seven years, concern is fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated.
However, the simulator cemented a Chinese rights to trademark freudenberg.
It was his own omission, as names in Germany are not subject to protection, said Hanno chemical specialities in Munich. </s> </S>, chairman of the board of freudenberg
and the registration of trade marks Marks rejected claim Claim.
However, in both the following instances freudenberg won, but the adverse party continues to struggle so far.
We must be vigilant
The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.
<S> hopes to bring the matter to a conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "The process extremely roads and -- we have a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs to accounting firms, the Archive had hardly see acts even a hundred years old, to give evidence.
Five years ago, freudenberg suggested adverse side vain "greater Greater amount in euros" for the settlement.
"Hence, it is clear how expensive it is," says Says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over, even in Europe.
and in the case of imitation register there unprotected trademarks.
One Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name freudenberg for footwear and leather.
The group has long stopped production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration.
"We must be vigilant," says Says.
Both he and lawyer Lawyer recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather, foreigners should be "all that in any way is worth defending, register also in China," says Says.
Otherwise, it can do much more than the registration.
Indeed, if the freudenberg loses in the last act of a drama about the sign, you will have to pay licensing fees for its own name, explains Explains adverse side.
Otherwise we will starve in the contested segment of the market.

More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus v.
Swaziland is reflected in In in miniature the disease: the highest levels of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection, almost half the population is not accepted.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population are the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth 20-not uncommon.
The Choir opened this village in joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants Participants saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but simply the: food, clothes, education.
without school education, there is no person in a poor country have no chance.
At first it was private commitment individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later the choir founded the Association "voices for Africa", which since almost professionally takes care of AIDS orphans in In.
Facts about infections, sexually transmitted diseases
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
the bacterial STDs are syphilis, Chlamydia and gonorrhea (().
frequent viral STDs are HIV, human Human, genital herpes virus and hepatitis.
<S> лобковый STI and scabies are Ukrainian.
What are the main Main group?
syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
heterosexual adults have often found sexually transmitted diseases are Are хламидийные candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea infections and human Human-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low-- but this group accounts for about 20 percent of new HIV infections.
among the youth Youth infections occur much more often than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections are young people from 15 to 25 years old.
We have among young people also often meets human Human-virus.
how to change the number of infections?
not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007.
In 2011, about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth of one less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms indicate has a sexually transmitted disease?
When infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, complaints in In, selection, pain in the bottom of the abdomen, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
because some sexually transmitted diseases can be spread by contact in close physical contact, and infection.
Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially if frequent change of sexual partners.
early diagnosis can be cured most STIs and avoid remote consequences.
patronage, donations and, not least, fees for speeches chorus throughout Germany allow something to collect.
"We have sent in In already about 200 000 euros," says Says аннете, chairman of the Association.
In the village of money from Germany manages Manages Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She takes care of the orphans were well designed, for example, one of the grandmothers.
<S> called Called old women, is the pillar of the village.
some of them took up 14 orphans, give them a roof over his head and take care of the children in the form of time appeared on lessons every day.
Those who have no relatives arrive at the shelter to To, lonely woman, receives a salary from the Association, as well as two Cook, who are preparing for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Association "voices for Africa" a sewing school, constructed two working jointly with the American Health Organization PSI has organized the surrender of analysis for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is obvious throughout the country, prefer to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Says аннете, "because he is associated with sexuality."
quite unusual in a country where the King officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch King Mswati III, black Africa, known for its love of largesse.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such an unauthorized state lifestyle also lays the blame for what v virus spread so quickly in the past years.
But it is also a stray, which carry the virus to the country.
Free condoms there are literally on every corner, "says Says аннете," but do not use them.
Another culture-flesh to flesh. "
to support cultural exchange, a little Choir Choir every two to three years, making the trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know ever since the days of apartheid.
The bus, full of white, who sing songs on the black language-such recognition not only brings a good mood and joy, but even happened, caused tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip also always leads in In, where singers attend sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village you can find on the map, in the Valley of the river River more than known.
"go to To, light," said local people there.
and after 8733-km flight back to Heidelberg, when When singers back in the rehearsal room on the street Street, and here you can see that this light burns.
NASA's messenger: opens the ice on mercury
"messenger" probe found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA confirmed the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there also have frozen water, as is evident from the three studies, published Thursday in a special journal Science.
"messenger" probe found evidence that constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered in ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes with a comet or asteroid, freewheeling Freewheeling.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said scientific probe head Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach 33 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how the water and other building elements of life in other places in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix", explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to earth: small windows in the endless Dali.
The image comes from a camera, which was developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
like Pluto, which turns around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, on a new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006, is not "the planet."
This fragment of the Spitzer telescope infrared image "is" family portrait "countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of a blue points, it is difficult to identify the star circle of pink" newborn stars.

One of the greatest and most clear shots of Hubble telescope: Galaxy maelstrom
Depending on the color images of the spiral galaxies into true works of art.
published by the European Southern Observatory photograph shows the remote on several thousand light years away nebula Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius horoscope.
The name Name comes from the Latin word Word ((трехдольный dust), as dark bands share in the cradle of the three parts of the fierce heart of stars.

This is the birth of stars Hubble telescope "withdrew in the spiral galaxy Galaxy.
The one who did not like the technical reduction, can call it nicknamed "southern Southern wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the IRIS nebula in the constellation of Of.

This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote 430 million light years from Earth.

This stellar cloud, coupled with With socket, are also constantly creates new stars at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing Galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, only the gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
our views in the universe: the key telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Hans-even before the Galileo Galilei a year later, began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes were all more-and their view of space available deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947-1975, "first" in the Observatory telescope Telescope under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The Mirror, shown here, has a diameter of five meters.
in Arizona, the United States, "the big telescope." </s> </S>
It allows you to look in space with the help of two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
"The Grand Prix Prix телескопио" has a giant inner-diameter mirror only one device is 10.4 meters.
"big South African telescope mirror" in South Africa Africa for cost reduction.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
A lack of affordable constructive performance: the telescope tightly seal at a vertical angle, it limits his mobility.
The telescope "hobby--" in Texas also has fixed a vertical angle.
its special feature: high High ability.
It reaches-despite the relatively small diameter mirror-parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
with radio telescopes in In (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to alien signals in space.
<S> has a diameter of 305 meters.
participating in the project "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti), any computer owner can help by providing its computing capacity.
The Observatory of European astronomical services (ESO) in view of the Chilean Andes.

His four mirrors allow cover visual Tunnel even mid-infrared spectrum.
in the Chilean the ESO also plans to install the European Observatory "very large telescope."
His main mirror should Should for 42 meters, and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected no earlier than 2018.
until 2007, both at the Keck telescope Hawaiian Volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world.
They installed two mirrors on ten meters in diameter.
telescopes "Keck" included in the Observatory on Mauna Kea, which looks into the sky along with them also with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and And.
In addition, the Mauna Kea should now be a new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of three meters.
here they can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space delivers the Hubble Space Telescope.
on April 24, 1990, it delivers a picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler" is looking for planets outside the solar system, first of all, which is life.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that i.e. 1,235 candidate planets discovered since the beginning of the mission.
The photos show preparations "Kepler space telescope."
James Webb space telescope (() will be sent into space no earlier than in 2018 on board Ariane 5 rockets. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: He must in light of the first stars and galaxies look for the big bang.
The scientists suggest that there are ice on the South Pole of mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the "messenger" moves closer to the planet's North Pole.
radar measurements for decades pointed out that there is ice on mercury.
also in 2004,, "messenger"-the first, which revolves around mercury, scientists now believe.

The final point is Is.

On 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian Sea, got here, in a province, not yet.
But PILATE Pilate (48) is convinced that in In have something to attract tourists.
"The famous festival in the Eurovision Song Contest in Baku in May next year, we will be the oldest people in the world," says Says Festival.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.

but controversial star of the museum is a sheep herder Herder ширали, which allegedly was 168 years.
the birth certificate, however, is not.
But taking into account the fact that the oldest person, whose age confirmed by documents turned 122 years, age Age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this area, died in 1973," explains Explains.
The man was married three times, and he was 23 of the child, in 136 years of age he allegedly was born the daughter.
a sheep herder Herder added a couple of dozen years to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about About in Central Asia.
"Amazingly many older people can be found in some areas of China, also in Japan or in the valley Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, on Sardinia also extremely many very old people live. "
But due to the lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no civil status registers.
Every day the glass baked oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Of shockingly often reach the biblical age.
20 people live here now older than 100 years.
Why, here in the south, so there are a lot of long-livers?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Farid explains this special genes Genes.
The director of the Museum of Of, believes that, on the contrary, it is a matter of nutrition.

propaganda is not often heard in the speeches of the old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of father of the nation, who rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then took over the reins of power to his son, Ilham.
However among Azerbaijani men no poverty.

The word "human right" is not in the constitution
The revolution was back in Cairo.
rival demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep rift in the country.
The future of the constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president is not there in Paphos.
We must create a transition.
"and its success lies in my responsibility before the people and God," he said on state television.
His speech was exposed to all the people, but in the first place to the Christian Christian, liberals, enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians.
After all, opposition still hopelessly disconnected in November, they are in fear.
The fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of powerful "Muslim brothers."
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said he temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded their competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old American engineer with a doctorate at the University of Southern California, it is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
It will be deprived of the forces of the Judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles managed to get in a 15-hour jump with obstacles on On configured the Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly raises concerns.
As in previous constitutions in the project, said that the trial is based on "principles of Islamic law."
But that means "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and fear that Islamists will use blurred the formulation and arising in connection with the Legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this suggests one the newest Article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, for the Council should be involved Al-- crucial Islamist institution of the country, who uses a large university authority in Sunni Islam.
It should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversight of the legislation, that the de-facto would be a consequence of the limitation of the Judiciary.
In the draft of the constitution is a matter of interpretation
Another problem: should preserve jurisdiction of civilians by the military court.
These courts during a period of Mubarak's power served to suppress opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
also, as stated in the project, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its morals and values."
legally it is formulated so vague that the public institutions with this article can even control the content of the film and literature.
Open Text this means nothing but as censorship.
No one article establishes the right to equality between men and women.
But the other prohibits insult and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be, remains unclear.
also questionable is the wording that the non-smoking "insult people."
will enough cartoons on the president or jokes about About?
The question of interpretation, as many in this project, which Morsi offers signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum.
"The revolution is Back"
already several weeks formed the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unanimity in the evening Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy this document, how will he be able to enter into force.
"revolution is back, and we'll win," said Said хамдин, which took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel peace laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."
through the short news twitter he accused loyalists of Morsi's desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares referendum, we will go to the palace and his," said opposition member Yasser said. </s> </S>
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers not Not yet," media quoted Egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali.
many judges also reported that they do not want to observe the referendum that would make it null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution."
well-organized "brothers", in turn, called for the other demonstrations, but of the precautions, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before the Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and the Salafis' supporters, who shouted: "the people require the use of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "" country! "and assured" the Koran is our constitution. "
The power struggle over the symbolic square, where it all began, triggered the civil war.
supporters of Morsi, quite obviously, we didn Didn want to go to this risk.
"the Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution voted loud and clear.
Now it's time to give the people decide ballot box, in which direction should have to go to the country.
Most of the project for the Islamists, this is resolved.
"The concept of" human rights "is not mentioned never."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda in fury forced from this constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (() defended the "Muslim Brothers", when Mubarak sat in prison or they should be brought before the court.
not because he shared their view of the world, but because of human rights Rights for him.
For this he was beaten, jailed, was arrested.
and now the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, regrets it in an interview with Welt am Sonntag. "
The expansion of Morsi's influence on all three branches of the state power disappoints lawyer.
These measures represent a clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game, and Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of having to strengthen the civil state, President of the de-facto annulled it," regrets Sayeda.
without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that all left it, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This may occur repeatedly.
protester in Tahrir Square, warns: "You're the monster, which will not be able to control."
Norwegian Norwegian: The Bad smelling of fish in the world?
<S> population of Norway has one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country as linked with local addiction to one extremely Extremely fish dish?
take a few Few pieces of cheese.
put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
leave them there for a week.
You have Have smell the smell of Norwegian Norwegian-one of the most famous delicacies.
I am in a small town called fagernes, three hours' drive from Oslo.
around the snow-covered scenic views. It is very beautiful, but in the air Air разлит characteristic smell.
<S> salt and And бродившая is the trout in the water up to a year, depending on what exactly = need to achieve.
As thicken twilight and And, crowds of Norwegians are collected at the festival in In, devoted to the, shall we say, exciting dish.
"Her eating a raw and parlour served Served, local Local vodka," explains Explains хавард, local fire and "" general "by profession, who runs the festival.
all around us, people eat fish Fish small cubes and served her massive amounts of alcohol.
"someone like Like than Than," says Says.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If we manage to carry a piece of nose, it's not so bad-differs little from pieces of sushi, which you long were taken from a bus.
<S> is the product of an entirely different times, poverty, a time when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish in autumn Autumn insulation closed barrels with salt water.
Then, deep in the winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly Thoroughly, her and And perception of alcohol use in food.
Even on the memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, more than 13% are immigrants, Mirela jobs, higher wages, and well-developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (long-standing rival, and it was not so long ago, and much more wealthy neighbor) massively come here to work.
<S> is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, though some smelling an element of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything here is expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs you at 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the World, and most of the inhabitants of the country, it seems, are satisfied with it.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Anders, racist and an extremist right-wing Wing last year and killed 77 men, women and children.
without mentioning his name, called "attack happened on 22 July."
<S> is very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway's prosperity today is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventies), one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress Waitress trays with elegant Elegant, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We the people-as you call it reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don Don like doing the show, we're not Not.
Norway is very carefully drawn from its oil-industry most of the oil and gas revenues invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all All money, which they have not been, Norway, very thrifty Thrifty all costs.
"As long as you can go skiing in the winter and go hiking in the summer, enough for happiness," says Anna.
"and there are Are," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for some food-- with me enough.
Here is a Whopper with With meat is certainly something exotic, tasty Tasty meat.
But the evening more awaits us all the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel to spend a special dinner dedicated to To, in which visitors to the ballot, to determine the best or, perhaps, most having aromatherapy fish.

It looks like a Eurovision Song Contest.
"Therefore, Tor-Jurgen, what you set for the best fish have there in the mountains?"
"Yes,,, here is our assessment"....

and maybe, just Just smell this fish.
Mexico's President, Enrique Enrique Nieto will be tough career start.
As Mexico's president-elect Enrique Enrique Nieto prepares to join in the post, BBC correspondent will grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and mixed expectations of the country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City, especially now in tatters.
This city overloaded transport and in the best of times, and on Monday were erected steel fence,, several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
But it was done not in order not to allow people to get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests to get to the parliament building.
The new head of Mexico's Enrique Enrique Nieto puts presidential Presidential Sunday and will take the reins of the country.
It is not an easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, who is now folds their authority, but the country has been embroiled in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed some 60,000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico on its willingness to deal with violence," said earlier this week, Mr Mr Nieto's US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements, next to the President of the United States political career of Mr. Mr. Nieto has developed as governor of his native state of Mexico.
in his homeland, in the country's populous and vast state surrounding the capital, opinions about the new leader are divided.
staunch man
in the idyllic town of Valle de bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
residents put him in taking the revival of tourism, SPA services and infrastructure development.
The city can be reached on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Mr. Nieto, who are very different from those roads with With and Yam, who were previously on this site.
a placard with his name hang on a modern building sports center and an interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"We associate with him hopes of real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Gabriel Hernandez, the congressman from state led by By Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change, that is so badly needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Congressman admits that after his 12-year-old absence in the presidential palace Los-by virtue party is pinning high hopes on Enrique Enrique Nieto.
In addition, he refuted charges of Of, which introduced the new president of the opposition.
He's very Very and very devoted to the realization of their vision for the future of the country.
It is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a person who will listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea about the former governor.
The municipality of Of, also known under the name of Ciudad-based, poses the most stark contrast with paved streets of Valle de Bravo.
The hidden under Under highways, he is in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City.
and problems in the municipality are too severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the suppression of drug gangs trading in these areas, troops were involved; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
<S> near vast landfill only for the last two years was found dozens of bodies of dead women.
More than a thousand women have been killed in the state of Mexico City during the particularly Mr. Mr. Nieto is significantly higher than this figure in the infamous Infamous violence in Ciudad Ciudad, which became a household name when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Mr. Nieto, about him in the best case, it can be said that during his tenure as governor, he has not managed to cope with the problem of murders of women.
In the worst case, his administration has been accused of ignoring this problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like the majority of houses in the nationals area,, иринея hardly holding back tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter Daughter moon.

My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize their potential.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben Ruben believes U.S.-origin that Mexicans are caught between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City I went down the hall for the coming close to the border area and was on the ground.
signs point to two: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second foreign language (foreigners).
I stood in the few seconds before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I called the Mexican life.
It's just a name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish people consider themselves to be Italians, and friends from New York.
Later I stopped on a complex structures "Mexican American origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional titles or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary are poorer than native speakers, and I can Can get rid of the American accent.
So I took his American passport and was in turn for foreign language.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexico's president-elect Enrique Enrique Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were familiar to meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: Immigration, drugs and trade.
<S> Nieto's President spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition,, Nieto's President promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals was not.
for Mexico's relations with the United States-heavy and full of old grievances.
Most Americans have never think about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to abandon half its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events.
That is why it is worth only any U.S. statesman Statesman word toward Mexico, critics in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society there are complaints that Americans prejudice the sovereignty of its neighbors.
and the descendants of montezuma Montezuma militancy.
The most complex are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about grievances?
There are enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, DENVER or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history or father or grandfather who has not had the opportunity to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
most Mexicans a certain type of dark complexion,, poor peasant families.
their descendants, and we remember about this.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made for good work, but we do not forget that even this American, and not the Mexican dream.
our national self-determination Determination and unclear, but we know what the country considered.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
we answer them the same.
they see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as As Mexicans.
We did not speak Spanish well enough, and our relations with Mexico not strong enough.
our very existence is explained by the failure for them.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not have been now for silk curtain, finding Finding life in the US, but lost a spiritual connection.
my wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States, even in childhood, and it reminds me of that friction between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, there are certain-Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin, is a shame.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group los tigres del norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.
getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we Americans....
and we are called the Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship is intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans to Mexican origin working kind of Mexico's ambassadors and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell their friends-Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great her visit, and would urge political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
yeah, of course.
nothing will come out of it.
too many of the grievances of the past.
and, given the gap between the rich and the poor, the new corruption and the drug trade, many of us does not believe that the country is so beautiful.
sorry, but But themselves Themselves.
and this is true.
If part of the Mexicans still can Can forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin still in the offence, most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed.
The old battle in the new Middle East
The cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundation for further peace
If it is possible to have a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
sound familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released with Gaza rockets fell in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, capital of Israel and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly mired in his change. </s> </S> conflict in the Middle East came
This can be interpreted in different ways, but the events of the Arab spring "" in rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis not managed to stay in the side from the vortex, the sector of the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are reasons, however, giving hope of a way out of this deadly impasse.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation gives no cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be executed, the collision occurred this week only strengthened security on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, who came to power in Gaza in 2007, provided that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the incurred loss.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were killed and 1.7 million residents locked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas increasing its popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by more moderate Fatah Movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion, that works for them.
The influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas grows new influential and rich friends.
Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, with support for Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
<S> the Hamas claim about creating around Israel Islamic Crescent from Lebanon in the north, which is governed by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all power is now more More insurgents overthrow Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where authorities threaten to allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on Israel's southern border, in the most populous and influential Arab country, in Egypt, where President Muhammad over Morsi's strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not Not special attention to support Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim Brotherhood Organization, are largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In a future diplomatic Diplomatic Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel come to opposite conclusions.
Hamas was crushed in a military sense.
Israel's "Iron Dome" missile system was its creation and successfully destroyed many of the running costs of Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to its unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that about 30 Israelis were killed since 2004 from missiles, issued from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state and protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party-within the framework of the preparations for the January 22 elections-have teamed up with even more violent conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.
What is the meaning to the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If you give in their hands all the power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will start to run from missiles in the direction of Israel, as do their brethren in the Gaza Strip?
better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head.
Perhaps, the supporters of the "hard" line victorious; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
The fact that Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries are not very warm feelings for Israel, their internal problems will be a priority.
Israel's defense part of the budget, more than all of its Arab neighbors, have together.
The outbreak of the war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
pragmatism Egyptian President Morsi, who, together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire is a good sign, and could mark the start of changes.
Israel, not least, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As the democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the house,, in Tel Aviv this week.
repression has already undermined the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect-the growth of the Arab population only exacerbate these problems.
for violent operations, which are held every few years in the Gaza Strip for the suppression of the Hamas movement, have to pay the growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need external pulse
It remains the only solution, which tirelessly called for rational representatives of both parties, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the creation of two states and concessions Israel territories in exchange for security.
hope remains, not too impressive in the short term, the hope is that the cease-fire will allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which it is time to take the decision to cut the supply of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position in order to convince Hamas to recognize the Jewish state, taken in the 1967 borders with the exchange of territories and sharing Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries also must make the effort to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would make for the creation of the Palestinian state, more than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which may result in recognition of virtual statehood of Palestine.
His role is to bring Israel to the bargaining table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to the solution of this problem.
It is tragically Tragically position.
The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the unified law came into force packaging for cigarettes.
The warnings about the dangers of smoking and disease-affected parts of the body image contrasts are on the damp green boxes, are identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law came into force that packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products, replacing logos and different types of color design the same box of bleak-olive color with nasty images and images of children affected by the disease parts of the body, whose health undermined their parents' smoking.
in addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the buckets, introduced Mandatory this Saturday-name brands, which printed the same fine print.
This is the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia said that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this habit of fashionable status.
The basis of the decision on the results of the research, the benchmark that people, not started smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 have never become smokers.
"It is obvious that even very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco company with the help of the packaging," Health Minister Tanya Tanya explains, referring to the research Research, children, for example, that the Crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so that these changes Don Don affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adopting such measures are already considering, and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market cigarettes, which will be sold cheap and available.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who think it initiated," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone who, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to growth of the business.
Sandra HA from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd, argues that demand for Silicone cases, where the unpleasant pictures on packaging and kind, rapidly grew up (with almost zero) since two months ago, companies such as British imperial tobacco, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against this law.
According to Sandra ha, Zico has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects the new party.
For us, this is a good business.
potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population, to which these measures.
After the adoption of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers to display cigarettes in a visible place, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and web sites to advertise in the network, but it can not limit in this foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco products and have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods on the Internet seem to you extremely attractive," explains Explains Freeman, news report examined the issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the increase in the number of reviews for trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in social networking sites, such as YouTube, twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether it is the hands of the ordinary citizen, which is so cigarettes like Marlboro that did not spare effort and time and made the video, or the advertising campaign is behind this?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco industry claims that now more preoccupied with adaptation to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relationship with Australia is quite insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Tanya, the Government has discussed with other countries to make their similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce compulsory, photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia has not obey innovation.
These pictures I don Don graze.
I just don Don pay attention.
"Just Just cigarette and And pack in my pocket," explains Victor el Hague, buys cigarettes with a photograph of tumors of the oral cavity on the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that could make me stop-and this is my little daughter.
James Yiu, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the centre of Sydney, argues that the same packaging has been complicated the task of putting products on the shelves
"Before I have the unloading of a new party left an hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government should take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: What to do, OK, all over, close shop," he says,, hands up.
Miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world-it is not so bad.
This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our aircraft have revealed the mechanical failures and it replaced the other plane, which we were pending.
Thus, I have had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
half a day at the airport waiting for a flight-this is really boring, and there's not much help no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.
But recently, more and more scientists and experts in child development support in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children not be bored so bad.
This forces the brain distracted on interesting related topics that may contribute to the work.
and since everything we are constantly before some screen in the modern world, the benefits of boredom they pass us.
Maybe we need to aim for boredom?
Yes.
and at the same time.
We will come back to this.
I, like many others, believed that before boredom-the invention of the relatively recent times, when people have got more free time.
not so, says Peter Peter, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian university of Calgary, author of the book "The fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively history, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact boredom can boast a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
This remains an open question as to how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, "says John D.., associate professor at the University of York, in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often transform.
Having studied the materials research on this topic and asking question target group in the 100, Professor Professor and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom-is when people "want to, but they can Can do that would bring them the satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, enterprise, he says, lies in the fact that the The man does not do something that would like to do.
The apathy, not want to do anything.
The experienced boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in mood and feeling that time goes slowly."
According to the description of the boredom can seem very similar to depression.
But Professor Professor argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions Conditions people see the causes of the problems in the world and depression, circumstances, and people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored, when in fact we just hard on something to focus on.
In his study "the unoccupied mind: definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal perspectives on psychological science, Professor Professor colleagues refer to by the earlier experiment, participants who listened to the recording voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises not related to the case of TV in the next room, others heard these sounds on low volume, so that they hardly can be dealt with, and the third group listened to voices of only record without any sound track.
Those participants who heard a TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, "it was difficult for them to focus more, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed the boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, "says Mark J. J., associate professor of neurology at the University of Of, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something Something, "for example,, in the flow of the products in the pipeline for marriage,, music can help avoid boredom."
It is, he continues, that when people begin to To on a chair or draw a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, we now know, however, that in fact such actions not just help relax physically.
"The study showed that children who did not prohibit fidget and governing, learn and remember more information is better than children, from which require sit tight," says Professor Professor.
In some moments we all experience boredom: When flight delay (in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, scanning the uninteresting kind of film.
But different people have different levels of propensity to boredom.
in the 1980s for measuring individual researchers developed a "propensity to scale such boredom."
to determine the assessment on such a scale of questions and statements are used, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and And" or "me too much interesting, so that there are not enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that frustrate, enjoy or feel bored boys more than girls, "says Steven Steven, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of various external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are often frustrate, enjoy or feel bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, personal and social development at the University of Illinois professor, conducted an experiment in which he contacted pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 percent of teens reported that they get bored in school and homework during the execution, and 23% said that they get bored outside the school.
Only 3% of parents said that they get bored.
Professor Larson said, that he had no information about what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
He knows, however, that "Adolescence has the propensity to boredom," mainly because that children and adolescents do not allow full, than they do.
back to my original question: Boredom is useful?
sometimes there is no, because in extreme forms, as research shows, it can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Professor who study this problem more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us, that you should do something different, and this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn Doesn always know what to do better.
If you be bored and you direct this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
However, if you're watching TV, you will be better for some time, and it will soon.
However, if your child is bored and you give him the The, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom alone or in any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor Professor.
"and such self-regulatory skills used in the most different situations," he says.
Your child learns by occupy themselves not only something, he also learns self.
I do not think that boredom need to praise.
However, regard it as something bad is not worth it.
rather, should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of operations and technology.
Professor Professor agree with it.
"We see this, so that we need more experience boredom, boredom is extremely unpleasant,, desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people tend to disconnect from the constant worries and simply relax.
"In the modern world we are accustomed to regular excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we go and we do not know what to do."
While it is unclear how the new law will apply on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, nineteen football team player and student of public college in the south-east of Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, essentially that soon will be quite legitimately on the entire territory of the State: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked.
Mr. Orozco said that once he was with friends in September in In and riding in a car on prairies Prairies when stopped by police near the border.
after police found marijuana in the machine, Mr. Orozco came agenda in Court for possession of drugs and drug possession of the device for minor offences, for each of which due a $100 fine and set the date of the trial.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But the criminal he?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the hundreds of minor court cases depends not so much on the law, many from the review.
The charges in the small offences associated with marijuana, already are in the hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.
Police stations have already ceased to charge people in 21 years of age and older for the storage of small doses that would be considered legitimate, only a couple of weeks, the law will come into force.
But in the more conservative districts in Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases associated with marijuana use, and still attract the responsibility for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities of the suburbs of Denver to mountain West vote to prevent the emergence of a new state shops licensed to sell marijuana in their places.
"All this is growing so fast that I don Don even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east from Denver.
Representatives of the supervisors in Washington also Also озадачено head.
They will have to create rules for determining the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all you need to do before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues marijuana use for medical purposes, and now first for entertainment.
"in Colorado, the more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and Smith, the representative of the Council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic products in the state of Washington.
But now, no one can do more to recognize Mr. Smith, than to put forward any proposals and hope that this would work.
"We have no real precedent on which we could focus," he says.
the Washington State Bill, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and on the whole year plunging into a state of uncertainty, when there is no system of state licensing, and the right to possession of marijuana but institutionalized.
and there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between state regulation of "adequate" access to licensed marijuana prohibition on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It is especially difficult to licensed enterprises on trade in marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group center "the legalization of marijuana."
On November 21, the police chief of Oates of Aurora sent out his subordinates by e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, to responsibility for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that police stop Stop people in these violations "from this moment."
Police chief Oates said that Police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals in the city, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue drug traffickers and distributors.
Prosecutor Prosecutor County in northern colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said, that the prosecutor's office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage use of its people undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of less than two and ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"The duty of our institutions to pursue for actions that are considered criminal in them," Mr. buck said in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where participants vote rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
grand junction, the biggest city in the county, police no longer attracted to the responsibility of adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
The district attorney Pete Pete supported that decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges already open storage cases related to marijuana.
"I believe that enforce the law until he will not change our duty," he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of residents of Colorado, who participated in the vote, supported this decision on marijuana use for entertainment in public and legal system will not be easy.
and the reaction of residents in different places of the state's ambiguity the relations between the local state authorities to experiment with marijuana.
"The District Prosecutors in this issue there is a cultural barrier," explains Shawn Shawn макалистер lawyer representing convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana.
"They harassed people for so long that now can Can really come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington-the first states in which a small number of marijuana are the same as for alcohol-is destined to become experimental field across the country to test the idea of legalization of the drug.
legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the territory of Of trade, but at the same time, they cautiously waiting for instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
marijuana legalization advocates hope that the Justice Department will cede on this issue.
Despite several received wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons in most cases, the federal government gave welcome on the trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs is unlikely to rush home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become close eyes on regulated by the state shops of the recreational use of marijuana, which are permitted under the new law, "said Kevin Sabet, a former adviser on combating drug trafficking in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores in the sale of marijuana, and so could not open sooner than a year later.
Last week,,, a city in the western part of the state, has six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which, apparently, will be approved in the next week.
"We don Don want to be in this position that we supply you with someone, and then license, it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
and now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and voted for that state.
There is still a lot of outstanding issues.
<S> петронелла: I survived from Oxford, because I'm a conservative.
The university students began not today for their views.
as much as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
my father and brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best institution in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, two foundations of civilization-forthright dissidence and tolerance. </s> </S>
And yet, two weeks later, studies on the historical Historical college faculty at Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father could not cope and cried.
friends were disoriented and confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn Didn like it, that my classmates have sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson sneered that I left, because I had to drink from From cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied at the private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this renowned cradle Cradle it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Woodrow, was well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.
You may ask, why to remember about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students,, center-right views, is the same kind of harassment.
This This and constantly growing hatred of the conservatives in Oxford students is so strong that last week a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as that which is disabled, the sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives from student club at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say their "actively isolate, personal attacks and often forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter in the equal rights of the additional college representative committee, to ensure freedom of expression.
Their only exacerbated the situation released recently on the BBC 2 documentary about student policy environment "country of miracles: young, smart and right-wing", in which the conservatives have eccentric and Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University conservative Association, who travels in Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and stick with silver Silver.
in other universities students of conservatives complain that make "scapegoats for improving the school fees."
Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservative provided University, said in an interview with one of the Sunday papers that "in a university environment increases skew toward the left.
people view us in advance, which we do not even know, arrogant and unruly children of rich parents with impunity. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history department at Corpus Christi College, which had filed a petition on strengthening protection, calls this "" "atmosphere, and Stephanie Stephanie, 19 years old, the new President of the Oxford University conservative Association, said that the attitude of certain members of the student club to center-right views worsened considerably.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussions, and just for the normal life of club members," she said.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I was there in September 1986, shy and shy Shy girl.
Oxford Oxford from hatred to the Conservative Party.
a year before that university voting deprived former Former Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree for budget cuts spending on higher education.
In such atmosphere would be uncomfortable even Even.
in the first days of the week, freshmen submitted when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt that lie ahead of me.
I didn Didn know that teachers not only looked through your fingers on the badger-conservatives, but the students themselves took part in it.
political questions and the miners' strike, privatization and the opposition government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa-penetrated through the walls trimmed with wooden panels audiences.
At my first seminar I was to translate the eighteenth-century French text in English, and I was not prepared, that followed it.
"Miss Miss," said teacher, the late Harry Pitt, Please translate first paragraph. "
The text was with difficulty, I I on me.
Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face like a cake.
"" did not learn French or they just drain is not enough? "he asked.
Other students Students.
by tears to my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few primary lessons of the French in their free time, if you do not, of course, very busy, rotating in society," "Pitt.
I returned to my room absolutely miserable.
in the evening I sat for dinner one in college; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second student with the Faculty of the English language, who presented himself as a member of the Association of conservative University.
"I know who you are," he said in a friendly.
 "Unfortunately, things are as follows:
above each, whom they suspect of being conservatives, will be prey.
I myself not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen-conservatives pretend that they are labour. "
Later, at the local pub, I too cowardly to it.
I insisted that I not with all that Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick failed.
first of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You're the daughter of fascist pigs.
You're contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was flawed, dirty.
"As conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
 "They beat each other, right?"
I felt like I was just like, should be felt homosexuals to criminal prosecution in the sixties.
If I ever live a normal life at Oxford?
or I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
will I had to become Become and hide their true beliefs?
The upcoming three years began to seem like hell for me, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, who has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman stone, a professor of modern history.
his hated not only for belonging to Thatcher's conservatives, but for the fact that he was an adviser on foreign policy issues and one of its Its.
in college, he has not appeared.
he despised his provinciality, pettiness and adherence to Marxist-- view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Of in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won Won be happy here," he said.
I travelled to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I said to my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
he didn Didn believe me.
During his studies in the 1940's were there any political views.
"But it is the best university in the world," he said to dismal.
 "This is not capable of, not only in the city of slumbering spires.
Even my friends-the communists always behaved impeccably. "
his wet eyes Eyes.
"not take any hasty decisions.
I am sure that this is just a joke.
you You me heart, if you University. "
I was Was regular trips to London and my emotional protection ultimately collapsed.
My friend, also a conservative, did not survive the pressure and abandoned its belief.
next week during the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
in the heart of time Screamer from shame, I admitted that "I washed brain parents" and called them "the old fools".
The respite was short-lived.
the last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At the time he wrote every week in two columns for publications, owned by Rupert Murdoch.
my door was locked.
I did not leave my pursuers, and five minutes later gave up.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never returned.
you can call me Me and cloth.
But in eighteen years nobody should not become the object of such anger and intimidation in the institution.
However, the sadder that it was Oxford, which not only has 14 Tory prime ministers, but this day is behind the exposed the reputation of the University, in which equality and forthright dissidence.

The toughest job in the world: the miners with With кавах
Four Indonesian miners risk their lives and health,, euro 70 kilograms of sulfur on top of a volcano on the steep Steep paths
There are people for whom their work hell, and others work literally in hell.
Among them are Are анто, one of the 400 miners, who earn a living prey sulphur in the volcano Volcano кавах, located on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
every day Day comes down on the bottom of the crater, where sulphur dioxide gas, rising from the depths of the earth, solidifies on contact with air.
<S> huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place basket on the shoulders and carries them up the precipitous rocky road.
up to the top of the volcano, which is Is meters height, just 250 metres, but But изможденным needed more than 40 minutes to climb a snail's pace, with Labour holding the balance and carefully Carefully Road to To and not fall from the precipice.
They know that one wrong step can cost them life, as has happened with one visitor from France, which started several years ago with rocks Rocks кавах.
miners with With кавах earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which are mined
Once at the top, they are paving a road between tourists that their photograph, as if they were monkeys from the circus and weights, wearily, carrying heavy baskets, March three kilometers before mining company, which put a little higher, at an altitude of Of meters.
We are talking about PT Kandy Kandy, enterprise, which has been running since 1960 this volcano, and better and not say, their workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, because this mineral common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"as the norm is Is 70 kilograms, we earn approximately euro 46.000 rupees (3.8) for every Every анто," explains to us, which usually performs three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end he feels exhausted, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems Seems for such Such efforts, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"" miners is very high by local standards, where coffee for collecting pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary equals two million rupees (167 euros), "explains the, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary was there just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the plot was not so heavy, but But returned from his family in In town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same massive as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and he brought her on including Jawa, she had converted to Islam."
<S> have asthma, breathing with difficulty, 'constantly, and he He eyes due to toxic gases
In his 27 years Years spent three years, risking a A кавах, sulfur which is already beginning to affect it despite the availability of masks and special glasses.

About 400 porters drag basket with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high sulfur mining company profits, not mechanized production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment bag, that work on your account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not receive even part of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) the collection for the picture, which, along with input ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this reserve charge the guards with tourists, who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people-mules.
"This work for cattle, but not for people," says Says, a stocky one of 42 years, who spent on On кавах three decades since I left College.

of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do human mules with With кавах.
Singapore is looking for children to Save Economy
Singaporeans accused career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore need to grow."
I husband Patriot, you're my wife Wife, perform our duty and create life!
It may seem improbable that these lines are part of the advertising loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of this-this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying like, 'Let's put Bao (() in the oven ", to laugh at the level of fertility in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which has made this video,, to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the entertainment form.
its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that people wanted to use the power of music to have "their national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world by the continuation of similar, so we felt that it is the theme that we must address.
We knew that the Government has to do a lot, for example to launch of spirits with pheromones or organize parties fast dating (blitz-visits).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
so we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, and compose rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not accept this so lightly, it is the Government of Singapore.
it spends $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm on the birth of a greater number of children.
The state package for couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, prolongs pregnancy and maternity leave, and provide tax relief.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national management of population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2-what is known as a percentage of substitution in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of couples and families of the national population policy, says that the reason "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"It helped people have a wide range of options in terms of goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase of the number of young bachelor or Bachelorette and postponement of marriage and the birth of her children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which focuses on a sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causes resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where barely concealed xenophobia thrives in many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which is criticized for keeping wages low and the failure to integrate.
Immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that growth in the past year, Singapore's ruling party got the worst result in the elections since independence.
after the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the assistance of the quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
At the time, as the falling birth rate has a certain influence on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policies, an example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not has been so little housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development has to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which you can build in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square meters of apartments sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote Promote lifestyle and deprive incentive housing developers who want to build a big family.
But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the firm Firm el developers, says that "shoe box" sold them much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increase.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that new rules give more clear guidelines for developers, who earlier put the tape, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
too Too
Singapore is a city-state.
While the new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after a conversation with With, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.
"People are very expensive, as well as over-stretched with some 80,000 UN peacekeepers deployed, housing and education, and because of this many people this delay," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
the men and women of the mention of his career, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them to have children.
So, no matter how the Government has encouraged citizens to the birth of children, that remains for the family, the last word for For.
The personal in offline-personal online
confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about private property or "sphere of personal life, which have a right to defend itself from any interference."

The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has opened accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latter admits that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It scares me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.

<S> марьелос поррас English and education and training specialist, believes that, to children and teenagers, you need to understand that the purpose of social networks-inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the arrival of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Academician mark Mark пренски indicates that, master of pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
The digital natives they are children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"Digital immigrants, which we have to teach them, while we are still learning," she said.
explains that this topic is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria that you can or cannot distribute, publish or speak in age, when not enough for this maturity."
"They were selective with, at the same time as the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what the privacy of children and adolescents, ask questions that make them think.

"South America should learn from Europe in the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the union of South American nations ((), held in Lima, Peru, state television said that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war" and in other clashes, "but now they are virtually one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project to establish the South American citizenship, which favor the The member countries.
"We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers of any South American country, as this is already happening with the members of the Andean Community, but until now there are reactionary sectors who want to get back to us in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has proved, in addition, a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we in the south, on the contrary, sign everything.
"inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum, Ecuador Ecuador founder Julian Julian.
Correa assured that is not sorry about this decision, because he betrayed their principles, and maintained its "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in his time "were certain suspicion that That will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed the process."
Moreover, he criticized the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual offences, while "the Swedish legislation thinks it is possible to do it through video conferencing, which could make from the embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Of.
"I haven Haven spoken with him since he arrived at our embassy, but I told the ambassador that he had a lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
That really is, so is the danger of worsening his physical and mental health of the confined in a small space without the ability to do exercise outdoors.

Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Granted since June and approved by the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of guarantees of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that negotiations were in London in search of a problem confined to the founder of Of.
We are talking about human rights, in this case, we do not use the word, but there were constant debate.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, because the lawyer for For, Baltasar Garzon hardly, leads a number of processes in the various European bodies," he said.
"and argued that" if Britain will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end up tomorrow. "
and if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and, as it has done in other cases, Senor Senor in Ecuador's embassy in London will, or will it on Skype, this problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa seized the opportunity to show itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said, "that does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of freedom of the press is not corrupted villains-politicians, journalists and bad, and speculative, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained happy, that neither of these journalists, "neither bankers nor bourgeois Bourgeois countries do not dominate in Ecuador," and added that, being reelected, "will deepen the revolution to continue in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in the The, at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and does not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legitimacy" because in reality "it has eroded the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considers, in addition, "completely justified" the desire his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to hold talks now with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision by the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Of maritime sovereignty.
At the moment it is not enforced.
It is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome to go together.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good outcome of the dispute on maritime borders, which are in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that "the right for Latin America to apply to the international court, if the two countries undertake to adopt a decision, no matter how heavy it was."
about the opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that this is considering "with optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured that if loses the election in February 2013, will leave public life.
in personal terms, I was never interested in power, but the unfair situations such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be fixed by political power.
"My political movement stated that I guarantee this probable victory, so we have to admit this responsibility," he said.
In the case of victory, it would be my last term in office of the President, and then we move out of public life.
If you lose, it is the same thing.
"This decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Nicholas, who told me that he went to the medical treatment that was already planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean exacerbating the health of President Chavez," he explained.

mortality rates from AIDS today is the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis of the AIDS gave a positive result.
"I like Like", he recalls the difficult, despite all the tact of the doctor, at the moment.
The hidden it from his family.
having to cope with the disease, he wanted to learn more about it as much as possible. and its efforts to materialize-he has already said his 43-day birth.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of HIV-branch hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be difficult to believe, too few treatment options, too little is known about the disease existed then, were too biased to the sick.
Even the Director of the Mexican institute of social protection clinic did not want to say goodbye to him, "because it was cut."
In other words, in those times have AIDS sentence.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and make it, not worsening quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus is already damaged, "" "their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
after 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the patient's survival, which begins to timely treatment, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Department of HCG, Jaime Jaime Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
<S> and an expert on HIV / AIDS,, Villanueva explained that since 2008, the researchers came to the conclusion, that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the extent of destruction of the immune system, available for patients with early diagnosis, with best anticipated life expectancy of those who did not use the drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when 500 reported CD4.
In short, this means that the one who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
to assess this progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from From in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database.
Only in In 255 people died in 2011, and already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
 Why do still have a lethal outcome?
 "for me personally, it seems, that the problem is not in access to treatment.
so I should imagine, so the case in our hospital.
At least we didn Didn have a shortage of medicines in the past 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don Don know about their Their, i.e., the later stages of the disease.
He led the crushing data: "nine out of ten patients come, when already have some Some infection; that we need to do, to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an early stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all the people who it will be."
In its proposal converge in the opinion of experts and officials of the State Council on HIV / AIDS prevention in In ((), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned in a private laboratory to test, only motivated by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Suffered саркомой cancerous tumor, which is one of the more common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that die, and Don Don want to know anything.
"The Times still die, it is better I'll'Ll three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm well Well, do exercises, take drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, I am an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, have about themselves and about another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with Milenio Jalisco, to prompt its statement of those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, is fear.
Let the if If if there was a risk of infection, let know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other man, being responsible.
It is his message summarises the theme of the struggle against AIDS in 2012.
condoms for counter
big gap between health programs and the simple citizen, journalist Ricardo Salazar, of the city of Guadalajara, which has problem with HIV.
and the biggest is prevention.
In places, dedicated to this task, "actually increased condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us packages on top, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still has no access to condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to the new infections are teenagers.
"Why you?" is a popular question, with With and condemnation by the consultants, school social workers, employees, pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear the teenagers, assured the Communicator.
I propose to change inefficient distribution; to condoms were not only for function and to hundreds of them was at the slot machines in public restrooms in places young people, who often visits.
It is not promoting promiscuity.
We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, condom distribution possible under his leadership.
"This is not sexy, it is best to make condoms available for those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
key data in In
registered 13,435 total 1,317 HIV and AIDS cases (12,158).
The state takes the 4-th place in the national rankings of new and total cases of AIDS and HIV 13th.
92% of the infections are related to sexual way, through the blood and 2% to 6%% path.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as one registered the case is from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.
Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision, vitro cancels debt restructuring group, which substitutes through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures for the survival of the companies, who are Mexican laws, are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
in the practical field, approval of the decision on June 15, judge Judge Hale in the bankruptcy court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves the threatened Mexican firms face the possibility of the arrest on their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to the tourney for the glass manufacturer in Mexico for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing as proof the three inconsistencies.
As the entry, while the judge in the case notes that lenders should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the fifth district court of appeals in New Orleans, says that the main trial for competitive production, considered in Mexico.
The first involves the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, since the UN was created for this purpose a model law on unification of international trade law, defining as the arbiter of American law institute.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that debt without Without voting, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production, which had before the parent company branches of vitro, would not have achieved the majority required for the approval of the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize the Mexican laws.
vitro was not the first case when, in fact, accepted this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among which Which and comercial Mexicana, whose Whose debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive production.
It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, or otherwise creditors vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely, the funds "vultures" like Like capital Capital convergence, Elliot internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have a majority.
vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These appeals court drops.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which it has faced since 2008, affected, which comes from the United States, causing serious economic crisis strikes across the country.
So far, the Gonzalez family Garden Company would appeal against the decision in the Court of Appeal itself to vote came before the plenary session, i.e., five judges voted, due to the fact that only three.
In the case of our failures will be charged with the application for certification, which will require the review process by the Court of Appeal, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (friend of the court "), which described the process, which should be vitro in the framework of the law about the competitive industry, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to associate it with Article 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy law.
In addition, notes that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, the rules set for interstate cases of insolvency, that guarantee equality for the debtors and creditors.
Carom from two Boards: they beat in vitro and hit the country.
