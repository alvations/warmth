'Paris urges actions in Asia

Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
The interest rates have to Hong Kong the same level as the US. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal support of the financial system. 
Otherwise we risk that other countries are suffering the effects. 
The bloodbath of American actions 
On Monday, the American Chamber of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, which it should have put up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 bilions of Kč). 
The legislators and deny the call for support of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the whole economy. 
The US actions lived, Monday, a bloodbath and the main indications of actions experienced the greatest fall the last 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987 
The index lost during the vote, but when it became apparent that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Congress handed: the government of the US can inject 700 billion dollars in banks 
The Heads of State and the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a form broader agreement of financial aid US financial system. 
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators carry out a watershed in the talks on the adoption of a rescue in the form of financial aid amounting to EUR 700 billion dollars (around EUR 12 billion kronor), given the financial system. 
The success is not provided course. 
In fact, before to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must conclude a number of details of the agreement. 
The supports the financial system will be examined on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Say Sunday to Reuters news agency, Barney Frank, the Chairman of the committee of the banking and financial regulation of the House. 
According to the sources, on Wednesday as soon as possible, the plan priori should be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to the economists, announcing the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
But, given the complexity of the mechanism by which aid to markets can be effective, will follow a " disillusionment. " 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
" We have made great progress. 
We have resolved our views on the form that should have the package of measures for the market stabilisation, " assigned to the Agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi should be invited. 
According to it, the final vote could be done by Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday, Sunday representatives of legislators meet the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to give the substance of the government a final form. 
Which should buy, with financial companies, immovable assets unsaleable resulting financial firms in huge losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety. 
" We are on the point of agreeing on a plan which will function and must be, too, effective on the market. 
It must continue this recovery plan of markets, but I think we are, " said Paulson. 
A signal to the Asian trade 
The global financial crisis has a great impact on the markets of actions which fall. 
Judging by the Democrat Senator évadiez Harry Reid, legislators are so that Congress will lead to a final agreement by Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first area timetable, where the decision of Congress could influence exchanges of Monday. 
But for the moment it is impossible to say with certainty when both Houses of US Congress comes out to vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by such and such a problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the days to come. 
But the law still to see many changes. 
The total amount devoted to the assistance of the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first USD 350 billion, as was the wish of President George Bush, must be made available as soon as possible. 
But, if Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the granting of the remaining amount, following two stages: firstly extra USD 100 billion, then, finally, USD 350 billion. 
Mr Bush welcome progress in negotiations 
Although the President can put its veto to this decision, Congress has the possibility of putting it in a minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the programme, which was to obtain finances for the purchase of the bad home titles, whose value to fall, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
" All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed Sunday at the vote of the law, and the Senate on Monday, " identified Senator Republican Gregg Judd. 
The President George Bush himself is pleased about the progress in the negotiations. 
Its spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased about the progress made on Saturday and appreciates the two-party effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy ". 
Restriction of sugar parachutes 
The President of the Senate banking committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement checks, the conduct of the plan on the axis of time. 
The new law also provides to limit these parachutes sweetening for the managers of companies participating in the programme and it establishes a committee, which will ensure the monitoring of funds. 
It should be managed by the Finance Ministry. 
" We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement which will be effective and for the market and for all Americans, " said Paulson. 
The plan also includes aid for property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new down-payment in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the instalments debtors and enabling them to keep their homes. 
Marek: a psychological aid 
According to the head economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult. 
" and this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of takeover assets from problems. 
It will be crucial to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, " said Marek, this week, iHNed it z. server. 
If the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important that this. 
" It is much more important that the congressmans agree, this week, that they support this plan, and that they will devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological importance of the agreement, laying down the adoption of the plan, is most important in this moment " emphasized Marek. 
A fight taken to extremes: the readers MP3 against the mobile. 
We advise you, how to choose 
Whilst practically all mobile know read files MP3, no MP3 player MP3 knows telephone. 
It seems clear result that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
And prevents that there are plenty of reasons to obtain an independent MP3 player. 
The choice is entirely dependent on the way to use and demands of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy a house for the gramophone upmarket expensive to implement the new Smiths of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such musical products do not leave on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen. 
But if there is in your shelves vinyl discs crowded, with art rock jazz, or of blues music, you dream at least probably such a gramophone. 
It is similarly music during travel, namely high-pressure music, to put it simplified way - music in MP3. 
Here too there are groups on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand Crowns for a MP3 player, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would be difficult to sustain the headphones bought for SEK 20 to the market. 
That is two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
The life-span of batteries is also decisive 
Some readers of music top-of-the-range are capable of much more than a simple reading of music, but it is unknown functions, of course, most mobile. 
No current apparatus is universal also that the telephone. 
A side of the primary functions, telephone calls and the sending of SMS, it is able to read of music and films, registering these latter, it has a camera variable quality and can, for example, until serve to navigation. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and communicators, you have in your pocket, a small computer. 
Given that no strategically shelve knows burn meat and that no television will take photographs, we are witnessing practically a miracle. 
But the universal nature of the mobile is not without disadvantages. 
Plus the number of functions that you use, the greater the meantime between two reloading will be reduced. 
And the reading of music is one of the most important goinfres energy. 
The mobile heavier few who are able to read the music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is considerably less. 
Here the readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient. 
In the case of cheap mobile, do they will play music for a few hours. 
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, you see, to be sure, a second recharge for the work - having valid even for appliances more expensive. 
E. problem will not arise not for the readers MP3, which are able, following a reloading, a continuing operation of at least 9 hours, including the less productive. 
A further problem occurs during registration of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, a limited proportion of aircraft has a universal connecteur USB, especially that not all cannot be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
We can, of course, make music directly on the map memory, but little card readers know go without reduction, given the tiny dimensions maps memoirs used in mobile. 
Regarding the readers, you only need, except exception (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to fulfil, through the connecteur USB, the apparatus of music from the computer. 
The majority of mobile and readers themselves will create a library medium classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the Smiths, style, or even according to the judgment of the user. 
Some appliances are that an index with a structure of tree, how to Explorer Windows, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operative system). 
The readers are easier to manipulate the mobile, have more know-how 
In the choice of a concrete apparatus, you get above all to the lifespan of the accumulateur, the memory, quality and the type of overflowed its and, of course, the facility for the contract. 
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if the day you will listen for a limited period of time, for example by taking the trams, you only have any mobile reading the MP3. 
Practically all mobile are now able. 
You are not even obliged to do too much attention to formats of music that the mobile or the MP3 player is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music which will arrive until you will precisely this format. 
It is part of the most widespread formats and from him, the vast majority of aircraft comes to read also music WMA format. 
The PCA (format used by the firm Apple and its iPod) is less. 
Mobile, top-of-the-range also allow, for example, the purchase of music online. 
It is enough to visit, since the mobile phone, web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier corresponding) and buy the song or Smiths in question. 
This service alone should be a convincing reason procure a musical mobile. 
The offers operators is unfortunately wretched and it is limited, in most cases, radio tubes quickly facts. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
Nevertheless, it is generally believed that this way of buy music (either by GSM, Internet, or by the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people are always mobile on itself. 
A whenever you want to hear something, you only have to get the mobile your pockets, when you have forgotten your MP3 player MP3 at home. 
But it is also important if you always on the headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated pregnant, that have practically all mobile, but a minimum of readers MP3. 
For many, the main advantage of musical mobile is their price. 
The cheaper normally cost less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand kroner, there can be one walkman already very proper. 
Whereas, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of solution for ordinary headphones. 
The price of best telephones and better equipped, filled also an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed 15 000. 
The readers, by contrast, have the advantage of having a command easy. 
Has anyone is to ensure the orders of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to cheaper (cf. our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the contract with a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet connect by chance, followed by a bill of transmission of data immense. 
What apparatus choose 
Even the mobile cheaper (for example. The Vodafone 527) have generally a slot for cards memoirs exchangeable (the type M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the purchase of supplementary such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kronor. 
But made attention. 
The basic models do not support in principle that maps with a maximum capacity of 2 UK. 
Just the more expensive are faring even with maps memory of 8 UK. 
If you have already a mobile and still want to buy a MP3 player MP3 cheap, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver. 
In the capacity (max. 2 UK), you must not spend more than 1 100 kronor. 
If you are part of auditors more demanding, choose rather mobile specialised - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These appliances are filled test independent command for MP3, and that is how the ease the commissioning is moving closer to that of a MP3 player MP3 independent. 
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile the series walkman have the same old menu user that readers MP3 sold separately, is one that has gone furthest in this area. 
The same service, in the same category, but with a capacity of memory (until 16 UK) and a lifespan of the accumulateur (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is guaranteed by a MP3 player MP3 produced by a mentioned above. 
A first operator a virtual operator gain the Czech Republic this year - even. 
Perhaps 
The market mobile in the Czech Republic is relatively late our operators proposing practically the same services that their partners in western Europe. 
Despite this, we lack any similarly something - an operator a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not fail for a long time. 
We have already mentioned, repeatedly, on Mobil. c z the fact that the Czech operators are among the most ladies in Europe. 
The ČTÚ (The Czech Office telecommunications), which pointed out that the price of a SMS was higher among us that in the rest of the Union, has confirmed. 
That is why, following the latest not of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may happen - the text-messaging since abroad to clients operators Czech mobile cheaper that country. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition which would enter in the fight. 
It may seem paradoxical, since we have when even three mobile networks and penetration which far exceeds 100%. 
On the contrary, operators mobile like to complain that the Czech market is extremely compete. 
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President-in-Office of the Council of the Czech Office telecommunications (ČTÚ), which has repeatedly declared that the Czech Republic there was more room for another operator, join operators. 
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently much chance (incidentally, now, it is rather difficult of frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - an operator a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of operators of virtual operators on the market mobile which has led to a substantial reduction in prices, which should, subsequently, also react traditional operators. 
Yet, even before the entry of game such that Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, of votes similar to those that today we are in effect in Britain. 
But it is apparent that there was room for such operators and they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples of this. 
In February we had informed the launch, in Poland, the operator a virtual operator Mobilking. 
In six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth operator of the country. 
Especially that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has amongst other U: f we Tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators operators having the opportunity to focus on a target group much more concrete. 
So that their operation to be effective, indeed they need much fewer customers, that a classic operator. 
They are, indeed, free of expenses of construction, operation and maintains the mobile network, relatively high. 
It is as well as in the world, the operators of virtual operators appearing as operators to low costs - they propose appeals and SMS cheap, which is often counterbalanced by an offer of limited services. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
But, as we see from the example of Mobilking in Poland, focusing on a target group unusual can also be a good PR stunt. 
In fact, this operator aims specifically men. 
" The real men choose Mobilking - an operator who and which they can trust, " said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this operator a virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk also at home. 
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone in doubt: " The Czech market is relatively small, for a segmentaire approach, which is based on most of the operators of virtual operators. 
Especially because it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the mobile operators 
It nevertheless seems almost sure whether there will be an operator a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
" We are discussing expansion of this project to success, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promoters. 
The launch of Mobilking will rather place in other countries in our area, " said in a telephone maintains for Mobil. c z Jana Studničková, financial group s spokesman Penta. 
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, at least not in favour of this idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible so that a competitor potential may appear. 
The Group Novera GTS, which would thus take another step is to become a real competitor Telefonika in the field of customers company, does not hide, long enough, its intention of launching an operator mobile a virtual operator. 
" We want very much to be able to propose to our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already led the negotiations about this possibility on several occasions with the whole of Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, " said the spokesman for the Group Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is therefore perhaps promising. 
According to information unofficial, it seems that perhaps we can welcome the first operator a virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by a total silence. 
" In this time, we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for an operator a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific. 
For the moment no subject provided a complex project and serious in this area has contacted, " mentioned Vlastimil Sršeň Department Telefonika press O2, in its statement for Mobil it z.. 
Others operators are also refer to the nature of the Czech market. 
The spokesman of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová says in a rare understanding with the declaration of O2: " We have not recorded for the moment of workable project and bilaterally advantageous, which could serve as a basis ". 
And it adds: " It is practically excluded that an operator a virtual operator in the network T-Mobile by the end of the year. 
To operate in such a short space of time, we should have limited now a concrete agreement ". 
Vodafone runs rather its attention on the fulfilment of the requests to obtain its own 3G licences. 
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: " We are open to negotiations with operators potential of virtual operators, and especially in the field of expenses and shared infrastructure. 
That is what, in our view, means more contributions from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field, the discovery of a partner for establishing a network for a mobile Internet rapid ". 
The responsible authorities in line with the operators: 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, entry to another operator would mean an increase competition, would have led to lower prices and therefore to a reduction of their benefit. 
A what good therefore facilitate the advent of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, the operators know agree as larrons in fair. The harassment accompanying the creation of the EU: f we also bears witness to this. 
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, the creation of the EU: F it, has been that exerted by T-Mobile society. 
In witness to the information available to the public from ČTÚ websites. 
But today, the U: F it lends itself serve as an argument for not accepting an operator a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová has noticed this subject: " The competition on the market mobile was, moreover, recently amplified by the entry on the market of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the market in RT mobile, it is obvious that the entry of a further overstretch the player, and especially its services, stringent requirements ". 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of regulatory agencies is disconcerting Czech. 
It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately has not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
Which belongs exclusively to the Office for the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
But this adopted, faced with this problem, its position typical. 
" The entry of an operator a virtual operator on the market mobile would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between an operator mobile and the operator a virtual operator about renting the necessary infrastructure. 
No such agreement has been reached for the moment, because the offers potential involved do not priori presented sufficient interest in the traditional operators, " said in reply to our question Kristián Chalupa of external relations department of ÚOHS. 
A statement and does not surprise by representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also take care to ensure that nobody will take its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing. 
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: " A abroad, where operators of virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry on the market has contributed to a fall in the price of mobile telephone services ". 
But pressure in the direction of a functioning market honest and lower prices is apparently not part of the interests of ÚOHS. 
What is indeed shocking is harmony touching almost three mobile operators, due to their reactions. 
The question, if it is really a chance, arises naturally. 
De the same way, the price of petrol strictly identical to all service stations is surement by chance and hard struggle of competition. 
" The office has not increased, on this subject, signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, it therefore has no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators is dominant position, none has therefore a corresponding responsibility increased its behaviour on the market. 
The necessary tools to opening up the market mobile operators of virtual operators are probably even regulator telecommunications, " has said in his statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ that telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has dominant position on such a market. 
But some experts of law propose another vision of things: for the creation of an operator a virtual operator is possible, we must achieve each time, the consent of the operator of network. 
And the operator mobile has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
That is how it is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity. 
But even without admit this argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
Yet the complaints many interested (including society GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they meet, in negotiations with all operators, similar constraints. 
Relapsing sustaining the responsibility on the ČTÚ is a quite aware in communications, whereby the ÚOHS is washing his hands of the matter. 
We have already seen this type of attitude in several similar cases. 
It has unfortunately not managed to get in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, adopted recently, an extension of powers of ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must very well know, but their interests are apparently other. 
When nobody watches, it can walk 
That said, the functioning of a kind of operators sham of virtual operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed. 
It is companies publishing their own list of price of mobile telephone services, but these are public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of firms in charge of multinational - level marketing. 
Mobile telephone services, particularisés are thus proposed by example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The lists of price of these firms are usually to elected representatives. 
The round of magic consists in the fact that the company done before the operator is a classic customer company, which commands a large quantity of SIM cards. 
As customer important, it obtains with offers of prices (and other special). 
This problem is that the trade conditions all operators Czech mobile prohibit such a resale. 
" If it occurred what you refer, it could be a transgression of contractual conditions that we examine and which could lead to a judgment of cooperation with the company in question, " has answered our question on this issue Martina Kemrová. 
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity is not arrived the leaders of the mobile operators. 
Particularly in the case of three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, nevertheless, to speak out against such a procedure. 
In fact, the activities of these firms are just their profits, and, at the same time, by opposition to the operators of virtual operators real, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing. 
Miroslav Čepický indicates the problems possible: " The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by a percentage of customers negligible. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their telephone is not recorded in their name, they cannot therefore be fully, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators ". 
Yet it is precisely that should seem strange to ČTÚ. 
Moreover, there is another question to the ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators blind eye on such a procedure, why blocking the creation of an operator a virtual operator? 
It should be added that the ÚOHS have fairly broad powers to unveil such activity and, if it does not wish to be content with explanations of operators, who claim have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions the banning. 
When we will not be the most expensive country 
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of operators of virtual operators on the market mobile has made a substantial reduction in the price of services. 
But in almost every country where appeared operators of virtual operators, the traditional operators strive, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by these were virtually the same - a market too little, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etcetera. 
Yet it is precisely at this level that are spoken in the developed countries, the regulators, who supported not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers. 
So well by formal steps by informal pressure, they did eventually obtain the creation of a first operator a virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators treat this issue to a hot potato which are disposed of in the passing a near target. 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot rid the impression that the confusion in the competences their is in these cases more profitable. 
But we must not give up so easily. 
If the back-room information true and an operator a virtual operator will soon among us, the market mobile Czech will perhaps movement. 
If one of operators has accepted the creation of an operator mobile a virtual operator, the ÚOHS will hardly remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) other interested. 
And we continue perhaps call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Ecoutez the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
Sunday s Day Czech citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?). 
The anthem has again been recorded by the orchestra at national Theater under the direction of Parliament Jiří Bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a song male or female alone, an interpretation with chorus and instrumental version. 
The song is guaranteed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors arrangements anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed it z. server. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful anthems. 
As it had already given before the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen for interpreting the versions alone singers with voices young and representative, who are marked and appreciated. 
" since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good proverb, so that it is well understood the words, that they are singing controlled simultaneously " he said. 
The Czech national anthem will, next year, its 175è anniversary. 
The Kde song domov můj sounds for the first time in 1834 on the planks of Stavovské divadlo (the theatre states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of savetiers), original Czech Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup. 
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriate. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath naturally became part of the national anthem. 
It remain one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent. 
How sounds the " new " anthem 
The public transport (MHD) introducing Prague, on Wednesday, the microchip in their ticketing system 
The Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be included in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Agency pragoise Transport) as the date on which amount in the underground, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a ticket by paper, in their pockets an electronic coupon. 
At the moment, it is accessible for almost one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.

More than four hundred people use the service during the morning. 
Those who will begin to use the shop online can forget definitively the counters in the underground stations, where they had until now trampling of impatience in long lines in the aim of obtaining tickets in paper. 
In fact, they will buy their coupon by Internet and it will Opencard on their card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries). 
" In these contact points, there are at the disposal of passengers a one-stop shop with trained staff, which will help those concerned with the purchase by the Internet and, furthermore, will the coupon they have bought on their card, " said the spokesman of the project Opatrný Martin. 
A side of libraries, it will also be possible to register the electronic coupon on the Opencard in cash dispensers installed in the vestibule of several underground stations. 
A squarely these distributors? 
They are red recall the machinery to composter the tickets and passengers have perhaps already noted in the underground stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
" Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty, " Opatrný added. 
A automaton will monitor the coupon instead of the driver 
The automaton which will work from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is enough to introduce the smart card and the Opencard coupon bought earlier will register itself on the map. 
The electronic coupon apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city. 
A in the suburban trains and buses 300 to 499, used mainly the inhabitants of Commons of Bohemia central to access to the capital. 
" In trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (transport integrated Prague), supervisors are equipped with card readers, to which they establish the validity of temporary and zonal coupons; " has explained the control of notes Filip Drápal organisation Ropid, shapes the working hours of public transport to do so. 
The suburban buses are fitted with card readers integrated into the coffers of the driver. 
In boarding it is therefore necessary not just to show the smart card in the driver, but it must also put the Opencard to the appropriate place on the side of the checkout. 
It is thus that the driver control the validity of coupons registered. 
" if the passenger would need to verify the validity of registered coupons, there is nothing more simple as to ask these information to the driver, " supplement Drápal. 
The passengers who take no buses suburban and does not recall the date where expires the validity of their coupon, can join again machines, originally used to record the coupons on the map. 
It is, on the screen of the apparatus, that will show the information on the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten demanding a referendum in the USA 
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated in the US. 
This stems from a letter tabled in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The scientific Library of Bohemia south). 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the bosses in the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans addressed supposedly in the US president with such a desire. 
It is between a letter preserved in a private settles, which is now tabled in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
Germans, Český Krumlov pray in the letter US President do not allow " šumavská župa " (region of forest in Southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - should be returned to Czechoslovakia. 
" We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops on the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but as liberators, " is written in the letter signed " own, which the fate of the Šumava close to my heart. " 
As supporting Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that brutality, attitude without respects, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter pray US President take in its hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever. 
" We cannot believe, that would give you this territory in a foreign state, who oppresses and destroyed the minorities and which has not contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, " is written in the letter. 
. The reason alleged why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge " Czech oppressors. " 
If the US president doubted the opinion Šumava Germans, it would only have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if its inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the bosses in the US. 
Although the text contained in the letter can, given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war period, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Whilst the Czech Germans should at least indicated that the issue of their expulsion of the Republic arises very little them to say such a possibility. 
Some expected that the US and Britain would gain for the Sudeten region a certain type of autonomy. 
Others believed that they remain simply Czechoslovakia. 
The famous journalist Gustav Austrian Chalupa, born in České Budějovice confirms this. 
During the war, it was, as a German of České Budějovice committed in shipping in the Baltic countries. 
Lorsqu at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the camp catching the region Holstein, dozens of Czech Germans were consulted for they learn Czech. 
They believed that once back home, Czech their would be beneficial, " said Chalupa. 
None of the Germans caught who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed, according to him, that, following the Décrets Beneš, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You cannot consider not - you pay! 
A campaign will emotional drivers 
The action road safety most expensive in the Czech history. 
One way to characterise the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport. 
The Office of the Aleš Minister Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers of a dangerous behaviour at the wheel. 
This is a campaign costing EUR 150 million will appear on the television, radio, the cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers of fast driving and drink-driving. 
But also remind them to take the belts before start. 
It wants to particularly affect the conscience of young drivers, your pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spots? 
Especially personal stories which will have to attack the emotions. 
In also reflects the slogan " bloody " of the whole campaign. 
You cannot consider not - you pay! 
The phrase " You do not consider " is enshrined ICANN-approved named on the registration plate. 
Then, in a blood puddle, there is the phrase " You pay ". 
What must embody that one can pay of life a moment of inattention. 
" The spots will haunt " spectators until 2010 
The Ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can see commonly pictures with pictures drastic victims of accidents. 
It thinks that this will lead to a lower level of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czech. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy sugar and the whip against drivers 
" What march with drivers, this is the system sugar and the whip. 
For them, sugar is represented by, for example, the fact gaining time, when they burn a red light. 
The force that is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks must be recalled the drivers, " said Martin Kořán, the psychologist Transport hospital Homolce Na. 
It is thus that we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, considers the psychologist. 
The signs saying the danger drivers are, according to him, already less efficient. 
" When a static panel which warns against a danger is installed, there will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will see more " Kořán point out. 
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli provisional government, be said in favour of the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including therefore the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria. 
It did this statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
" We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories occupied (), or all " said Olmert on a daily basis. 
" We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since otherwise, peace will not happen, " he added. 
It admitted that the return possible includes East Jerusalem. 
" Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem and, above all, do not wish to tractors and bulldozers crushing him the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to abandon parts of Jerusalem, " noted Olmert alluding to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a solution for the Temple Mount, the holy places historical and " located within the Old City. 
" Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty on the entire town will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not work, " he emphasized afterwards. 
Pensions of the Golan Heights 
Olmert said also in favour of retirement of Israel from the Golan Heights, what is, according to him, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this also require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
" I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a pension from the Golan Heights, " point out. 
" The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to obtain the Golan. 
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to abandon the constant supports that they attach to Hamas terrorism (Shiite movement), Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, " clarify the Prime Minister. 
Questions which arise after the accident: cabin in the illegal because they are? 
The law is ignoring them; walk in a because long distance is forbidden 
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of society Student Agency almost Padua, Italy, the question if the cabin and passengers can during the journey move inside the coach. 
" If you wanted to respect the law strictly formal and activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic, " said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, during which has died a hôtesse aged 22 years, has apparently been caused by the driver of a lorry has the path of the tickets. 
The girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver s seat on the most dangerous from the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
But the coach can have an accident, or hinder a sudden, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes the newspapers. 
What matters is if the coach is under its technical statement equipped squares standing or not. 
If this equipment for places standing is not approved, passengers must remain seated. 
The long-distance bus Student Agency do not have seats standing; what has been confirmed in Aktuálně. c z by the Director of the company Radim Jančura. 
" It is a question that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we have achieved that passengers may go to toilets during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, " he unveiled its position. 
The law ignores the steward 
" It is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription Visas do this role. 
On the other hand, no legal prescription prohibits not the carrier offer services. 
The law on road transport is only the term recipient of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, " adds with more ambiguity the spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the département of the movement of road vehicles, believes that, on the contrary, the law trafficking sufficiently the problematic. 
" Everything depends on whether the coach in its approval permission to propose places standing. 
All that lies, " he says. 
The buses are divided into urban, where there are squares upright and a maximum speed, with limited inter-urban places upright and a speed allowed higher and long-distance bus without place standing with the maximum speed limit the higher and seats fitted with seat-belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, expert BESIP (security of road traffic) in safety in transport, does not see the movement of cabin on board as a major problem. 
" At a regular movement, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to the service in aircraft. 
Here, it is not sure when happen turbulence and hôtesse air can beat your head ". 
" whereas, in the case where the coach would have slowed down a sudden, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
De the same way as in a city bus or in a tram. 
The carrier must manage the safety of cabin by internal regulations, " he says and also think that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved. 
Jančura is prepared to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier coach services to propose the cabin. 
It in recruitment two hundred. 
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a profession at risk. 
" Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that it is a profession at risk, I remove. 
That passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper boarding. 
It could also downgrade the cost, " he says. 
The concern is the reason that gives the absence of cabin in its vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which provides, in comparison with company, a very small number of lines. 
" We have no hostesses. we oppose, since the beginning. 
Early or later it will end by a fatal accident, " he said, there is a years, Týden it z.. 
A great tragedy came 
A young hôtesse in the region of Plzeň, who worked for society for two years, has died at the accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian lorry has probably quité the gang of emergency judgment without using clignotant and it has blocked the way to the coach. 
The driver to try to avoid it by means of a manoeuvre sudden, but it was almost by its side right. 
Jančura rejects the two seats reserved for the rest of cabin have been sold. 
" In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked ". 
The company account sue the lorry driver. 
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the Court, but as regards the financial compensation, it is also on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in view 
A change in the law, which is being drafted, for more than a year, by a group of thirty experts of the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movement of cabin on board the coach. 
" but it has not led to any conclusion on this point. 
A true say, it is not interested too buses, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the motorway and use mobile at the wheel, " said the expert Hořín. 
" The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of cabin as something which would fundamentally jeopardising the safety of passengers, " concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, specifying that the control of the security of coaches is under the power of the police and the office for safety at work. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The big words do not lacking in the letter by the Steering Committee WestLB, the employees of the house. 
De by a union of entities from the financial institute Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, " the central institution of financial markets of financial group of the Sparkasse " could be, according to the letter published on Monday. 
The WestLB would " bloc of competence " doubled to a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
Somme, such a relationship might be the kick-off crucial step towards other concentrations in the banking Länder. 
Hide what it is when a committee Executive Board is to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, injured, is still suffering a strong pressure. 
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Authority Federal Surveillance Services of Financiers which has, this only recently, made it clear to the government of Land North Rhenanie - Westfalie that the time was counted in the search for a future solution. 
However, it is issue for some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - a relationship of a form between the Deka bank, which is the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Although the leader of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas indicated during the presentation of the figures of the six months late August that he had no sense in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, that this is the Helaba or WestLB. 
But the Board of Directors of the Deka, which each half is borne and banks Länder and by groups of coffers of savings, instructed the Steering Committee of lead talks with the WestLB for common commercial activities. 
It could then be the debit side of the financial market, or parts of it. 
The talks to begin, however, have just said in the financial market. 
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, account for one of the largest employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, between at stake lorqu' it is question of boosting the coffers of savings. 
In 2003 we believed for a moment that the Deta - Bank could be merged with the bank of Land Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab. 
Nothing is evident from this ternaire mix. 
Barely plans had they been made public that the government of Hessen Land itself against any participation of the Hellaba in them. 
And the result, the other two houses either does not rejoignèrent. 
The Bank of Land Rhineland Palatinate has been attached to the place to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there was always new negotiations on the reunification of the Deka-Bank with banks Länder. 
And lastly, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering committee of the Hellaba, was however voted against any trade strategy of merger with his bank. 
Quite apart from this, the feeling seems spread that the amalgamation of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election in Parliament of the Land of Bavaria, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could materialise in first. 
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure which obliges new mergers should increase the potential partners outside it gradually. 
In the South, it now would be a junior partner, although it has so far better resisted the crisis that the banks in Munich and Stuttgart. 
Grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which has 85% of the capital of the Helaba, has however drawn a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
Remain NordLB rigour. 
De such thoughts geo-strategic does, however, that one side. 
One another facet raises the question of knowing how the various business models of each of these banks can deliver. 
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely through what trade model the viability of the Länder banks should be guaranteed, had not previously resolved by the German grouping coffers of savings and transfers. 
A term, a carve-up of the WestLb could take place, carve-up who here is obviously not wanted. 
It is also what it is in the letter of the committee Executive Board in place: in any case, it would be covered a comprehensive solution " for the establishment. 
De how all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend the celebration of beer is also known as the weekend of Italians. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies it as small friend, and therefore nothing is this, he says. 
Behind them, almost a Danaides five litres of beer brand name, Kaiser, is a bearded well built which shows around 200 visitors from the celebration of beer what sounds profound its gosier can produce. 
First Elena pat Luca, then the embraces.

And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italian. 
The bus belong to Marco, which bears a long coat doubled false fur and glasses for the broader silver eels pairs. 
Since five years, they go to the celebration of beer, already three virées this year alone. 
They go night, remain the day the festival, and come to 10.30 p. m.. 
Are we spend the night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco. 
The travel costs EUR 75, including the kitty welcome with a beer Kaiser, brewed in accordance with the law of Bavarian purity, insurance and a responsible for the group speaking German - Marco has done a language courses in Frankfurt. 
And already buses driving in the night on the Autostrada direction is Brennero. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus passengers sleep. 
It is better for example, they will still need their forces. 
Breaks, will be made to Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with sclerosis of Italian vehicle number-plates are once again a pause shortly before Munich, on the motorway 8. 
When the small morning, the group of Marco is finally coming to six hours thirty as scheduled on the garage almost the place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses throughout Europe are already here.

This is the second weekend the celebration of beer, known as the Italian - end of the week. 
There is no precise figures; we are talking about 50 000 who way through the Alps and collapse in the kiosque to beer, 10% of visitors come to Italy would express this weekend. 
The Munich police is reinforced by seven police South Tirol, by search-and-rescue teams Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which implements a statistic on the country where the Italian occupies first place before the British (60 speeches) and the Austrian (approximately 80) with almost 200 medical interventions. 
Which is particularly appreciated by Italian, it is trying to the brewery Hofbräu. 
Night sleep for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Finance Minister there was only a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician used the word is relatively and it slip that the German banker sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis. 
Which is indeed in this weekend. 
The financial Bavarian housing Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX obtains a consortium of German banks an appropriation of ECU 1 billion to protect themselves turbulence of markets. 
One in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are issued until an amount of EUR 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction on what it would thus law. 
The money comes from all private banks that banks public law. 
In the background, it is society - Depfa girl who bears the losses. 
The financial state was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the fact of distrust of the markets. 
The first half of 2008, the liquidity reserve of the bank was reduced by 95% to 2.37 million, the rate of own capital was also slightly faltered 1.6 to 1,45 percent. 
The ongoing net profits and those from financial transactions were, compared to the same period last year, at zero point, the benefits from the allocation of debts and determined securities and the cancellation of provisions in the operations of credit had fallen by more than 70% to 5 million. 
And it is only through the important benefits the reimbursement of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as the reimbursement of interests according to the book tax procedures and commercial purchases for businesses to Konzern that the deficit of the gains of approximately 16 percent has proved to be moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state had initially badly speculated on industrial appropriations, which then had been filialisés the bank Aareal. 
Because what the financing of classic state was not sufficiently profitable, the Depfa was then committed more closely in the infrastructure projects and the funding of joint projects between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) diversified and internationally. 
On the value of society - daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must proceed to amortization which should have on the calculation of profits and losses of group an essential material which is still unclear. 
The fact is that dividends have been cut. 
Funding for 2007, they had been truncated two-thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate, since the takeover of the Depfa, an investor and highly important infrastructure. 
It is more robust than other institutes of refinancing dependent on the market inter banking - since it has no submission of customers. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers there are two weeks, the allocation of appropriations between banks once again expressed constant considerably, who accumulated banks their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually on part - approximately 50 billion - for the global appropriations for the Depfa a means short-term refinancing. 
According to a statement of the Hypo Real Estate, funding of the group is covered with credit in the medium term and the company protected influence of financial international markets largely outside condition now. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009 
The chairman of the committee Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Group Hypo Real Estate should no longer having to resort to the financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Reserve and the federal establishment for the Surveillance Services of Financiers (Bafin) assume that the ability of the Group Hypo Real on the market is now guaranteed. 
The shareholders and creditors of the bank did more than hoped. 
But, in view of the dynamics and impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
This is not unthinkable that we should not use the funding throughout its scope. 
But the contrary either cannot be dismissed. 
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, even at the gates of insolvency Sunday late in the evening, for the least provisional will not reassure the minds either. 
The course of action has fallen 75% to 3,30 euros. 
The recent obligations, however, are particularly well. 
So that debts primarily have barely budged, prices loans from second foreshadow plan. 
The worst affected are especially investment funds of the old society - daughter Württemberg Hypo and those of course which have a lifetime beyond 2009 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an investment of alternative speculation, now their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution that has brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the issuing bodies, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time. 
Or will this that nobody dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months. 
But with the noise renouvellés of partial renationalization, the likelihood that got the sureté has now become a mere hope based. 
It should reserve nights of sleep above all creditors long-term the decision whether they must secede from their commitments. 
The short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line to be a postponement losses for the coming years on the next income tax capital gains automatically taken stock. 
Sylvana and the secret the boite to Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, must be present for the very first day at the Highschool of Tachibana, girls are beginning to pouffer laugh: German is so " kawaii "! 
What is - this - that it mean? 
Sylvana is already this word thanks to the Mangas - in its new Log exchanges, she mentions Japan. 
" The first day of course Japan. 
What is - this - that I was alarmed. 
Funding the path to go to school fear me. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I have to find the road alone, fortunately I am not lost. 
The start of course does not seem to be set so strict as home in Saxony. 
The pupils appear one after the other from eight hours, until nine hours least twenty, a round table discussion starts with Professor, the " home room ". 
But before the course starts, this was for me to appear. 
I am not at all of the kind to love speak to people, particularly in a class of 40 pupils. 
As I had not yet the uniform school, I put an old jupe my mother of reception, and a shirt, rising socks and blue leather shoes. 
In this place so I am before the rostrum, and have tried to pronounce properly all: the Sayonara Wo she Sylvana... - I call Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday in a week. 
At this time, I was very pleased to have begun to learn the language there of two years. 
The 31 girls of class have all done, whispering, pouffé laugh and signs, and I have constantly heard the word " Kawaii ". 
I already knew thanks to my mangas. 
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of ados Japanese and means touching, sides ". 
Secondly I am quickly crept in my seat. 
The daughter beside me has made me a great scornful smile, it found that it was an honour that corresponding the should sit alongside it. 
The rest of the time has been fairly calm, but when the drumming has spoken, I have been beset in the rules. 
Everyone spoke at best, pouffait laugh and poses many questions - in this case, it is rather difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the pause, they will then have all out their Bento. 
My mother of reception I had also mentioned this kind of Lunchbox - it really is something other than the paltry German snack. 
I had rice the aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of concombre and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
The things have a bizarre appearance and a taste completely new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Bon, except perhaps plums salt confites, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches Japanese in schools. 
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared itself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a bit better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read this in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could see here too. 
" Why Japan in particular? " asked me my friends when I have been told that I wanted to spend a year to school in Tokyo. 
I have always responded: 
" because it fascinates me, what " 
In the end, read the mangas, that is what I prefer for years already. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture which is, at a time, I have also begun to learn the Japanese. 
For me, it was very clear that I had to travel there one day. 
Because I too have a weak to traditions, the habits and customs. 
And here, they gives great importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technologies and latest trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional. 
And as everything is so well organised, I have never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city that I have never seen ". 
The rats also have their sensations 
A rat or a cafard fled to the danger, is - this - that it means that we also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations. 
But how can we check that it have the same thing when it behaves in the same way as we? 
In the magazine online " Edge ', contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE present in a series of articles of the answers to the question " What you be true without power proof "? 
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of conscience without me or anyone else has until now been prove as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all the human brain have the same configuration. 
As soon as we look to other species and that we are dealing with the issues of felt or in general of awareness, we are moving in difficult terrain because the hardware does not correspond. 
When a rat before a danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack. 
The human beings behave in the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a subjective comparable. 
But I do not believe it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our lived subjective that animals difficult. 
One of the aspects is that the associated circuits almost always to human conscience include the cortex latéral préfrontal (the fact of its participation in the memory in the short term and in the functions of direction and implementation). 
This vast region is much more developed among human beings that among the other primates and seems to be completely absent among other people. 
All the less so for these aspects of our conscience which depend on prefrontal cortex, including the conscience of which we are, and the ability to pre-empt and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings differentiates even other primates. 
A significant feature could reside in the linguistic nature of humankind: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, this often means that its conscience by depends. 
In this case, we could exclude animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, the Commission certainly influence, so that the animal conscience, regardless of how it is produced, differentiating probably many most of our states of conscience. 
That is why it is so difficult to determine what can be awareness among other animals. 
If this, internal and subjective, does or measure or, in this particular hardware, analyse based on our own experience, his comment raises serious problems. 
Most of my developments refer to the content of the lived aware, but it exists alongside another aspect of the conscience which should be more easily accessible scientifically. 
It could examine the process of conscience of animals without taking account of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on the nerve correlations of awareness on the causative mechanisms: the two may be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of prefrontal cortex in achieving view. 
But that means for emotions? 
I conclude that an emotional system such as the fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we define as " Fear is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localised defence system in the brain (or its follow-up, as the reactions of the body) absorbs memory alive. 
So observed, emotions are closely linked to regions of the cortex which characterise the primates and especially human beings. 
De subtle degrees of felt, associated with our nature volubile, can be seen, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorising states for the blame others. 
Conversely, Antonio Damasio by example think the sensations from activities primitive originate in the regions of the feeling of cortex body and the waistline brain damage, just as Jaak Pankseep which, however, concentrates more on the waistline brain damage. 
As this network has not altered very much during the human development, it could quite part of horizontal sensations in any kind. 
On a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict him, but I believe this prove. 
Pankseep argues that what is as fear among the man and in rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how can we however check whether rats and Hommes feel the same when they behave alike? 
A cafard fled to the danger, but if it is fear? 
In my view, similar behaviour is not sufficient to prove experienced identical. 
Although the comparison nervous help: rats and Hommes possess brain syllabus similar, the cafards by against have not even a brain. 
But is - this - that the waistline brain damage is at the origin of sensations? 
And even if we could prove it to mankind: how can we show in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I do not know how the demonstrate. 
And because their sensations differ from probably completely of ours (since human conscience is based on special circuits and on the language), I prefer to explore the behaviour that the emotional sensations emotional rats. 
In any case, progress poignent on the nervous plan insofar as the tonnage is the same thing in rats and human beings. 
As I is not exploring the language and awareness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
It could judge this as the short term, but I prefer forward rather than beaten me constantly against a wall. 
I am in fact a émotionel pragmatic. 
Platini, chairman of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik has explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister. 
" The government considers UEFA s decision to Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, together with Poland, the European Championship ", announced Wasjunik.

In the timetable for the construction or the destruction of stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines. 
The number of stages for the championship of Europe could possibly be reduced from eight to six. 
" We cannot more time to lose. 
We must work to the maximum speed, " said the President of the League Grigorij Ukrainian Surkis. 
" The UEFA has constantly to the eye '. 
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland. 
The direction of the League of Polish football PZPN has been suspended by the Olympic Committee National after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, Administrator independent. 
The Committee met on the request of the Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It is a real danger that the PZPN is not capable of acting in the rules, " said Drzewiecki the Polish press agency PAP. 
" We have assured in a letter to the President of UEFA and the preparations for the European In of 2012 does not suffer ". 
Several members of the League of Premiership were already in the season, sentenced to manipulation of compulsory relegating; in the end, the beginning of the Lega has even been which is out of date at the last minute.

It wanted to make the promotion for a new film, spoke of his privacy in an interview - and now has problems with its ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on his ex adultérin Dennis Quaid. 
It clearing out - and counter-attack. 
A war of late Rose for the ex couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, both Hollywood players are engaged in a battle inelegant - seen to everyone. 
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: " Dennis has long been unfaithful, and it was very painful ". 
It would be aware of the extent of deception only after divorce. 
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in the press relations of Ryan for his new film " The Women " - is told the history of a adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on its qualification of unfaithful husband fell clearly: this would Monstrueux ", " said the " New York Daily News ", 54 years, that " Meg rem' task once again the history of our relationship and the rigs. " 
It would be more " regrettable ", " pain and upheavals that contain a divorce for every child are new rekindled in public " for their son of common 16 years Jack ".

The price of tickets and hotels fall 
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and nights hotels were cheaper than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a study, the current flights would be reduced even up to 50%. 
Theft and nights of hotel would again become advantageous - it is the result of a study of the provider of financial services and journeys American Express. 
The company has analysed its data reservations of the first half of 2008 and has established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a clear falling profits in the second quarter. 
After that prices on the market hotels have increased over the years the nights hotels have already reduced in many places. 
De January in March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined yet 6.9% on average in comparison with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined. 
On April in June, prices were however already 3.6% lower than the previous year. 
The trend has been clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers should paid 30 to 37% less than a year ago. 
The causes of this reside for American Express in the low dollar rate which has led to a " travel envy falling American tourists '. 
The financial markets such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in the price of hotels that industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish town, prices hotels lie with an increase of 26,3 percent, the record in Europe. 
So in terms of prices of flights, the trend was on the increase in the first quarter: 
Given the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers economy class have pay on average 7.1% more than in 2007, the long-haul flights, very consumers of fuel, even have risen to 29.2 percent. 
On April in June, the price of tickets economy class have fallen by an average of 12.5% in comparison with the previous quarter, in business class and first class however, variations in price have been widely less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices have experienced a fall even more important than in other European countries: 
De January in March, prices have risen 11.9% in the second quarter, they have fallen by 23.6%. 
The German domestic flights have even been divided by two according to this study. 
The reasons for this falling prices would be on the one hand a slowing down economic growth, explains the firm. 
The request feel-good factor ground in many market segment of travel by plane. 
On the other hand, there is a growing pressure of competition by the Treaty " open Sky " which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign the tense situation is the abolition by airlines not profitable routes - and the high number of airlines which have tabled stock during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe. 
HSV fighting Gladbach 1:0 
With an aim and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay still has not managed to strike a functional eleven. 
De Kristoffer Klein. enlarge. landing in disaster for international player Marko Marín. 
The Gladbach player not return that late in the game and its sights lifted fail against the framework of the goal. 
Its message was precisely formulated, it was out of its lips of case persuasively. 
It knew simply that he was right. 
" We need this second ", Hermann boo Rieger in the corridor off of the arena of Hamburg. 
It was not going much in the changing rooms, half-time was finite and most stale were in their place. 
Rieger was for almost three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, it enjoys considerable reputation as many old protagonists. 
And that is why its request has been received the strategic places. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and has lifted the encouragement to approve. 
Cornelius brother of the entraineur in Head of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
Much orders seem to have been similar: and that it is with this second purpose! 
The implementation has failed. 
" Everything was not very nice to see today, " did later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would " wished also be more relaxed ". 
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg must to a successful minting the head by Mladen Petric (the eleventh minute); and the fact that the very low Gladbach players could not be harmed the weak players of Hamburg. 
" it has been a dirty victory, " summed up Marin Jol. 
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years. 
Funding Saturday afternoon, fans be commemorated themselves, the blue sky over the fray and the tables of provisional classification on the screen giant that indicated their club as first class. 
Their will be an anniversary without genuine celebration. 
" We know take hindsight, " said Marcell Jansen. 
It is clear that the intermediate result of the picture longer reflects the unpredictable nature of the first League that the domination of its HSV. 
The team with its arrivals late committed - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the guardian of purpose Petric as Jansen débauché of FC Bayern - are admittedly slowly, but it is not yet. 
" We need more charm and more dribbles ", demanded Jol.

De this dark influence theft of space probes 
For years, a phenomenon mysterious leaves researchers in the perplexity: the dark influence on the speed of space probes during the so-called manoeuvres gravitationnel support. 
The experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct. 
Since almost 18 years, the space probe " Ulysses " steals in space. 
Du made conductions fuel soon frozen, death cryogène the threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is cause confusion among researchers - the anomaly support gravitationnel. 
The support gravitationnel is a ploy of space probes, by which they get an additional impetus in the scope gravitationnel a corps lofty Earth by example. 
For example, the probes can save many fuel. 
The research probe américo - European Cassini-Huygens used this device physical, just as the solar probe Ulysses. 
That is what surprised researchers also for years: would create objects are not always 100 per cent of the way in which it expects venerable according to the laws of the gravity. 
More, irregularities occur at the speed. 
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower. 
Until now, physicists could not explain this. 
They the baptise the anomaly support gravitationnel. 
Some experts feared that the theory of relativity general Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of the terms of the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American scientist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study assume hard as still believes that Einstein chose and trying to explain the anomaly support gravitationnel to aid the so-called black matters that astronomers have identified in the universe. 
" The black matters could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the earth, " he writes. 
The researchers the area know the existence of the black terms only for some ten years. 
It is apparently a force of attraction whose effect is observed on other heavenly body. 
It is completely invisible, namely that it sends nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation, particularly no light visible. 
According to the calculations scientists black, represent a good fifth of the whole mass of the universe.

The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect money savers, including 59 societies of the building. 
The Director-General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles has stated that it is " irritating " that companies and their members will have to pay the bill 
The 14 billion loan will be repaid when mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are released. 
But the interests which are at the same time increase will be charged, each year, the financial 700 companies who collect the deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 societies of this building are included in this list. 
It is irritating that institutions which have behaved in a prudent must now pay certain bills institutions which were much less prudent. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It proclaims that every society must pay a sum proportional deposits that it holds, and that the interim societies must pay around 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will in 2009, in 450millions. 
It means that companies must find 81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the trade committee of companies from the building, has said on the BBC this decision it seemed unfair. 
It is irritating " that the institutions which have behaved in a careful when the resumption of housing market, must now pay for the institutions much less prudent. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals. 
" we must examine all aspects of this issue during the next few weeks, to assess the options to adopt to prevent the societies of the building and their members pay this bill salt " said Mr Cole. 
The interests for 2009 cover seven months, at the end of September of this year until the end of March.

The American Advocate-General has appointed a special accuser to check the question of the dismissal of nine American prosecutors in 2006 
The everything is born of the account of the general inspector Department of Justice, who criticised the actions of certain ministerial officers.

New York has hundreds of Avenue, boulevards, streets and other roads parallel, certain famous, other functional only. 
. and even some taxis veterans and local residents of long-standing know do give instructions to extra Place, because they have never heard. 
The streets lies in the East Village and wanders the northern First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
AND approximately 30 feet of large for 120 long, it resembles a dusty gone rather than a lifeline active. 
. no signs indicate the streets. 
It is virtually impossible to find it on a atlas standard. 
This street has however admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent buildings of luxury on First Street. 
It would repaver extra Place, and create a more fluid transition towards shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Others admirers including longstanding neighbours, have said be happy with this shortcuts simply because it remains one of the recent and more long-standing streets of paste homes. 
But the Department of Preservation Development and property of the city which administers the street, has no interest to keep it. 
This month, at a meeting of committees owners of neighbourhood, representatives of city phrase and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal authorising the housing manufacturer to buy the streets. 
But the committee prefers the streets remains in the hands of the city, and asked to submit a new proposal next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No 3. 
" It leaves little areas belonging to the city, and we hope that the city retains extra Place " she said. 
" They could offer to rehabilitate and manage, what also Avalon could do, but we want to maintain public ". 
Avalon Bay announced there are several months she wanted to repaver the small streets and installing of seats, some would used by a coffee which the manufacturer concede space. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public in the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the door floor of Avalon Bay, said that although society wants to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner. 
The main interest Avalon Bay is relooker this gone abandoned, and make it public, " she said, stressing that this was the city to suggest the sale ". 
Seth Donlin, a door floor of the Preservation housing, confirmed that the city wished sell the street, stressing that the agency s mission was to develop ownership rather than the manage. 
Compared with its neighbour more colourful, Bowery, extra Place has left a slight imprint historic. 
Some believe that Extra Place bears the name since 1802, when the legacy of the great firm to the many children Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving away this small, who stayed since abandoned. 
After the entry of CBGB, a monument punk closed rock in 2006, has ré open to extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photograph in coverage of the Smiths of Ramones " Rocket to Russia " 
" this place was wonderful " said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, which took the photograph in November 1976 
It was full of scrap, haillons, barriques, around, leaves and ropes ". 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already spoke about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public. 
Others have proclaimed extra Place as a true scarcity - a fragment practically identical to the city that should be done in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who drives a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (under - headline " The Book of Contestations: a Regard Amèrement Nostalgique on A City in the Kimberley Process of extinction ") recounting the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: " extra Place is a small close cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and delimited by the doors of a warehouse in railways rusting away and persiennes, full of newspapers last week who are soaring along the gouttières ". 
A few exceptions, the streets has always the same rate. 
A rat short agilement at the bottom of the alleyway, almost a door which led once the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a shop skinned clothes. 
Graffiti, on the walls, a bottle of beer 22 ounce vacuum, based on side of newspapers which have just been cast. 
Around passers-by said they did not think that rarely to extra Place, and suggested its value. 
Mr Field, his hand, said that he thought certain under felt the attractiveness of the streets in its current state. 
" The best years of my life " he said, " were held in darker places, and disgusting wet ". 
The Debate Bilingue dumping in the English language: 
In this part of the programme for supervision of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about education bilingual. 
Lance T. Izumi, former member studies in California, and former director of the department of education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of books " not as Bon that you the Pensiez. Why the middle classes must be able to choose their school ". 
To attract the voter favours Hispanic is a complicated business. 
The proposals Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr Obama emphasises that " students African-American and Latino have less chance to diplômer that students white. " that is true. 
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr Obama supports especially among many other subjects, " education bilingual transitional " for those learning English. 
But the question for Obama is whether its desire to achieve a bilingual education which defends education in class of languages other than English, will also its interest designed to eliminate the differences. 
For example, Prep Sixth Street, an elementary school of conté Los Angeles. 
The students of this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic and low incomes. 
Plus one-third of students, comprising many new arrivals, studied English. 
Among students of CM1, 100% have spent examining state of maths of 2008, expert level. 
Likewise, almost 93% of students have spent examining English - of languages - of arts 
This unbelievable success was achieved thanks to another ingredient that put forward by Mr Obama. 
Sixth Street placing on analyses, practice, a constant evaluation capacities and an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy, reaps Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street, this has created school education of the English language " full dumping '. 
The total dumping in English language focusing on the almost constant use of English in education. 
Miss Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education has affirmed " we have had an enormous success with a student who had arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you would without its class, you would have had no chance to identify the ". 
" That works, observed, " has market for us " 
Mr Obama he should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and respond in other schools composed in majority of students Hispanic learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves, but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education support long bilingual education) and its enormous support for education, the pronostique bilingual obscured the response from Mr Obama. 
Although it is favourable to the immigrants learn English, Mr Obama recently seen this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop disagree about the wording of the laws in the English language. 
" contrary, he said, " you must assure you that your child speaks Spanish ". 
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, he should then consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than the dismissed or regarded as insignificant. 
'Paris urges oil Nette following the New concern the world economics 
The price of oil has fallen considerably on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan in favour of financial marches, will be able to revive the economy.

It took the second time, when the jet transform a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
" I have never seen anything this kind " said Ellis. 
The second time began after the jet and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under obscure clouds. 
Can the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a happening in Laveranues Coles allowing an touchdown 12 yards, handicaps of a after noon during which their relationship has done a leap forward. 
Favre found Cole for two further touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds half-time.

The Cardinals have taken control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the jet have recovered the ball, Feely did an example Jay 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to zero. 
It was the best that could mark the jet at a time. 
" The Belts of Jets, Eric Mangini, who were asked to describe this madness, said, " the second or third time "? 
When he said the two - the jet missed 21 points in the third time - Mangini said: " I can tell you that I have most appreciated the second time that the third. 
. " many points have been marked in a short space of time ". 
Gebrselassie re-addressed, beyond the world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, has again proved to be worthy of a better long-distance athlete of the century, after having beaten his own world record in Berlin marathon Sunday, became the first to run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2:03:59 a race accommodating on the flat, Gebrselassie defeated 27 seconds its record of 2:04:26 disputed, last year in Berlin. 
A 35 years, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record its successful career during which he has won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, 1600mètres the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing - can be exaggerated way in the eyes of today - that air pollution is increasing its problems asthma. 
On the contrary, it promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect - time sunny, 48 degrees initially, 55 to the arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an average impressive a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The runners trail as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenya, converted into runners, contributed to reducing the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in these last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa earned in Berlin in 2:06:05. 
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie told the cameramen, have suffered the crampes mollet two weeks before, and having missed training for a week. 
It is obvious that the rest has enabled him to remained brilliant, but not rusting away. 
" I am so pleased, " he said the reporters. 
" Everything is perfect. 
I am called last week, and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything has gone for the better. " 
It has reproached - especially in Kenya, the rival African is Ethiopia - to have too orchestrate its races, avoiding the stars marathon global, relying on the hares as if they were in a race, and recital more the world records that the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not reduce the greatness of capacities of Gebrselassie as a cyclist. 
Gebrselassie Sunday, preceded by four Kenyans had a time of 1:02:04. to middle way. 
Two runners to Kenya elite, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to defy Gebrselassie after the leaders have missing. 
A a little more three miles of the arrival, Gebrselassie has done its final rise to depart from Kwambai, which ends up second in 2:05:36, improving its best record staff of five minutes. 
Kamathis is arrives third in 2:07:48. 
In the race women, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, has completed a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19. 
The English Radcliffe Paula holds the world record of 2:15:25. 
The spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years, has surprised everybody winning the London in an 2:24:14. 
It could not take part in the games of Beijing because of a hypothetical wrong at the back, but promised to win in Berlin, raising its third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It run making use of a clever strategy, leaving the group of runners Ethiopian and Kenya take a great advantage, the then exceeding around 18miles 1/ 2 after. 
Askale Tafa Margasa Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, whereas Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third in 2:25:01. 
In a City to Part, pride and hardship of the Black Vie 
Hide in the development of its great park, a few miles from the sunniest, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a small town where arise quiet pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
" Eatonville, first city black fully to integrate, house of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that it did in 1935, is not so easy to make our days. " The town in five lakes, three short of croquet, 300 skins charge, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison ". 
It has now become a city pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Cinema Contest every year to Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in various ways, the city she described - has become tourism thanks to its inclusion in the tour guide the Florida published by The Depression - era Federal Writers, Project- remains a place to hand. 
It is also worthy, private independent and that it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural population slick Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, " we knowing if little, do not know what he loses ". 
Even if it is the year of the election of a President black, Senator Obama, which was also invoked open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious with from abroad. 
We are very careful about how to tell the story " has said Hortense Jones, 59 years, resident for always and the oldest paroissienne of the city. 
" it must be in line with reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It represents both a historic model of a black seizure of power and a community of almost 2 400 people where the rate of poverty is twice the national average. 
It is a central point but also an example of rural culture southern black - a few times ignored, other times hailed - which recalls the birth of slavery. 
What would explain why residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, that everyone here is Hurston. 
It presented his home city in the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as " Mules and Men " (1935) and " Their Eyes Were Watching God " (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide to Florida transform this city, located right out of Route 17, a road which crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten which leads in chapter of history and the human tragedy. 
Such a big cash bold in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers of ownership of first mayor of Eatonville, Mr Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
Last " road on the Left ', writes, " you will find the modern public school brown white and, with its gardens and these areas well maintained game which Howard Miller has always taken care, although he knows just read and write. 
It did also mention the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " sells drinks of any kind and that everything that can serve the people. 
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston combined Eatonville car in a government but also to the analphabétisation, on remariage and sex. 
Of course Fodor was not as well. 
This was not in fact a portrait that everybody disliked. 
Zora has described the reality " said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, a young girls Johnson that Hurston has immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who extol their beauty ". 
It added: " some people have not appreciated ". 
We remember always Hurston as a person and an eccentric, who had frequently after his family has moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remember that Hurston was usual in city without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and was of trousers here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes. 
Many were fascinated residents, Mr Franklin has told, whereas many a mockery of it. 
" people were always pleased Zora " he said. 
But he adds furthermore, throwing in his chair the arse patio on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly christened that " it were never too long ". 
The death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a star literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only woman slick from the Barnard College of 20 years, it was buried in a grave any, to Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived. 
A Eatonville, no great celebration, or mark for the general public. 
I do not think they have understood the contribution or the legacy that it emboldened the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography of Hurston published in 2003 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Civil servants of Orange, County wished to get across a motorway to five ways city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, street to two main lines of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already prompted Interstate 4 until the perspective west of the city. 
The proposal was made while Eatonville be deferred just a difficult period of its history. 
A forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the isolation relatively idyllic community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mix of races led hatred at the gates of the community. 
" then, young white came launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the glaringly " said Mr Franklin. 
" a woman is even died ". 
They waged a pastèque their car ". 
In a letter of 1955 sent to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the request of the Supreme Court aimed at a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education " insulting rather than glorifieuse my race '. 
The residents proclaiming now that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has watered down the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the confidence of the young. 
" black children used to be embrassés - I remember welfare we embrace our master the morning, and the evening " said N. there. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and head in head of safeguarding the Community to Eatonville, a group not profit. 
Which lasted, it added, until teachers and students nor more of the same place. 
" You embrace not tone White professor because it is white - I want to say that there is here a dividing line " cultural said Miss Nathiri. 
The civil rights, moreover, have enabled us to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, players and artists who went in addition to the damage, as it, army of a free-and-easy confidence own and lines of action such as: " how can they be deprived of the pleasure of my company "! 
It is beyond me ". 
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went on the grave Hurston anonymous and began to fight to revive its reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduce and American cannons. 
The draft the motorway happened just when the daughter the most notorious Eatonville had recovered its appeal. 
And this time the old neighbours of Hurston regard as a sauveuse. 
The Community has begun to organise a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this motorway. 
Hundreds of fans, came to the opening of the festival after two years, and many back in January, to commemorate. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
" The fiasco five motorway routes, extremely rapid, a real civic pride " said. Miss Nathiri. 
Miss Boyd summarised the saying that " Zora saved Eatonville ". 
The victory against the draft the motorway enabled it to change its own image. 
Which people non-resident, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who frequent our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998 
A library mono subject (renowned obviously Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a wonderful Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: to six miles of Orlando, it can at any time to consider itself a back streets after summer at a rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1800 s. 
(today 90% of black) 
The foreigners coming discover the history of Eatonville, its raison, are still treated with caution. 
It must ask permission for most interviews, and certain things - as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating men blacks in the fields - must not be photographed. 
Many to Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a teacher courageous and which has a low for the red lively, are still afraid that their island community is understood. 
But, given the expansion of Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerged. 
The young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better or worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse insane composite and that other ethnic groups and racial in America. 
It is the civic affection sincere in the voice of nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, which provides for return to Eatonville after the College to work for the local government or for the forces of Police, who need additional forces. 
And even for the most young people, as Alondra Alexia and Kenon of 11ans, twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned properly Eatonville description. 
" The most people, who are in this area, will: " Oh, this city has nothing compared to other " Alondra Kenon said after the church last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at history, it is a very beautiful city ". 
Here, in New York, all speak fluently finance. 
But nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan took place far away from kiosque and TV screens giants Times Square, they do not make that they are in the eye of the storm. 
And they could not think that in the offices in glass and nest of bee over their tète, bankers and managers of hedge funds who monopolize New York, the worst " working day in office since the fall ". 
The pizza continue to slip on the streets, with their trolleys and their muffins away for meetings matinières. 
The is Latino drag always between residential buildings, as the donkey, 50 shirts print glossy hanged a yoke prepared on its shoulders. 
The office continue to queuing to buy their sandwich matinier to itinerant traders, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 7 p. m. in week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I decide to go open a new savings bank. 
Fortunately that I had planned to work end according to midday because I discover in my local bottling JP Morgan Chase, 20 people queuing. 
Not before the counters of cashier or to withdraw the species or make a payment, but before the one-stop shop the customer service, where the usual customers where their checkbooks, tourists demanded the direction for the Macy shop, and new customers began of accounts. 
Most of those in front of me I learn later, my " banker Starr staff allowed ", were all the tail for the same reason that me. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They have withdrawn their money of so-called savings thrifts (such a society of building), associations of credit, and the type of savings banks and their local subsidiaries which are operating in a state, and who tell us treat customers and their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt. 
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank to capital of 327$ has made use of the syndic of bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers returned to their homes for the week ending this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, savings accounts of a value of 440$ million, sought désespéramment a purchaser to save it. 
The office and employees of shops are before me, frightened of potential another debacle, have transferred their money to a bank which they believe is reliable, be the most rescue to Wall Street. 
New Yorkers, any became very familiar in the world of finance in recent weeks. 
" I heard a lady in my local supermarket Chinese, speak on telephone Lehman Brothers, the bank which have gone bankrupt, and its meagre Director-General Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it could have to criticise a colleague. 
And, in the Lyn doorman uniform my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or shipments of my fruit and vegetables. 
It told me, following my visit to the bank. " I have put all my economies in the monetary fund market. 
" I have changed, I do not want to take risk ". 
Falls desecrated Muslim whereas Austria fluctuates towards the right. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, which has abandoned the right-hand side of the Freedom Party and various alliances party, Filip Dewinter the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation " cities against Islamisation " to Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008 
They are road signs of mosques removed in red. 
The Police accuses right-wing extremists have desecration of a graveyard Austrian Muslim, the week ending the victory of political parties of the extreme right wing the general elections of the country. 
Over 90 graves have been seriously damaged the cemetery in Traun, almost Linz, between the night of Friday morning; that is, the police, an action organised. 
The criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Etoile David; the detectives believe, however, that this could be done to disguise the feeling of hatred extremists towards Muslim immigrants. 
This accident could be somehow linked to the elections. 
A door floor of the Community Islamic local said be deeply shocked " to the announcement of this desecration, which occurs right during the months of Ramadan which religious nears its end. 
The Austria think seriously to recover his courage, following its oscillation towards the right in the parliamentary elections of yesterday. 
The two right-wing parties who have wins almost 30% of votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign anti immigration. some of their slogans were even considered, according to the criticisms, as xenophobia. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18% of votes, has led his campaign against headscarves and burkas, and has even expressed its opposition to the food alaha. 
Durant its final race in Vienna, he spoke of " European brotherliness " to avoid the rise of Islam. 
The two parties try to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, saying that they would be a political symbol of the islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
The opinion polls and the analyses carried out immediately after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the political block the height of the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who has made a difference, because concerned about their future in the European Union.

" I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of its character " Günther Bauer - photographer 
Neither away, nor by blatantly transgressing clothes. 
The essence of the great master the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, freed of all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
On the one hand the artist. 
And on the other, the person. 
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these times unknown to the general public, where we find to intimate gestures and eyes stolen artists who care not to climb onto the scene.

These people photographed " in the street, " are artists able to transmit on stage passion, sadness, the joy... in exciting the public. 
For capture of moments of personality of these artists it must not make photos on stage. 
They have a personality and a unique character. 
What interests me was to create an intimate atmosphere which allows me to capture with the camera of moments of personality of stars intoxicating spirit of flamenco. " 
With the festival " Chant popular Mines, " Bauer began in 1997 a long journey snapshot of the singers guitaristes dancers, or with a camera to mark. 
It is the portraits which, thanks to the choice of the camera and hardware, given the classic photograph. 
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the hand of the traditional image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco according to Bauer: " A music with very traditional roots evolving surprise and every day ". 
It is not the song and dance in itself, but of personality and the nature of the artist who ogre the public with its art. 
Research of the essential and the magic has been the constant this work that is presented these days here in the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from around seventy artists photographed. 
The project has been transformed into a pick out some classic passages of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collecting portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for portraits of Bauer led to repeat the idea there are two years with the " portrait of old sportspeople " (" SportARTproject "). 
Although the concepts are different in Flamenco - people ", the photographer admits that it love photographing the portrait people know and enter in their lives for a moment more or less long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the kind the more difficult. 
You you find in the face of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or leave you only a few minutes to make them a photograph. 
Despite these circumstances, as photographer, I always try that my ideas reality ". 
This collection portraits of the current intoxicating spirit of flamenco entitled " Flamenco - people ", is exposed to the gallery El Fotómata, located in number 20 of the streets of the Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October.

The novelist American hispano - has recognised that " there is no means " for measuring and whether books change life. " but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an experience ephemeral " stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it " has implications " and " makes people less similar ", because it has asked the writers " not to succumb to the frivolity " and assume their vocation.

" Sangre de Mayo ", the gamble of Garci dared 
On the basis of stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci re-establish the famous Battle of Spaniards against the French in " Sangre of mayo ', which is the most ambitious film its filmographie with almost 15 million budget. 
The filmmaker has tried to put in the many characters and illustrate the social analysis " he has always admired in the work of the novelist famous, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of players. 
The film of a period of more than two and a half hours, " Sangre of mayo " will disembarking in cinemas next Friday, which will become a soap opera for Telemadrid more four hours. 
Grand admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci ensures to have done with this Eyre " a dream of child " thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who was responsible, there are three years, to turn a commemorative film for the two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, something that it has always agreed when the story stuck to national historical facts. 
The 15 million provided by the Madrid Commune are for Garci a unique opportunity for reproducing with the settings and clothing appropriate the atmosphere of " a Spain which has mistaken head for the fight, since, the fight for independence has led the people to rebellion, under the rule of Ferdinand VII, " he said. 
But the filmmaker regret not having achieved a funding as for films " leader Alatriste " or " the ghosts of Goya " - more than double that achieved for " Sangre of mayo " - because it has not been able to turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he has cooperated during almost all his career. 
The filmmaker " Volver has empezar " has influenced on its usual way to work on the dramatization actors with which he has used to repeat before beginning the film and that it does not cast, since it seems " humiliating " and considers that " the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and cinema to take inform ". 
Many players in " Sangre of mayo " repeat before the camera, as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Four times candidate Oscar (it has won a), Garci considers that the three candidate films which represent Spain this year to the Academy of Hollywood, " Sangre of mayo ", " Sept tables French billard " and finally the winner, " The sunflower blind ", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, which deserves to be better known, " he said. 
With this film Garci does not expect a price. 
" At first you believe that you work for posterity, then you have realized that you work for prosperity, and now you have only make a film in more ", explains Garci after over 30 years of professional careers. 
Bayón Isabelle puts himself in the skin of the sévillane dancer Tórtola de Valencia 
A sévillane dancer will pay tribute to a also dancer sévillane. 
Carmen Tórtola de Valencia, the daughter of a father Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a mother Andalusian (Georgina de Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the area of Triana and which at the age of three years will live in London with his family. 
It was a dance dancer free and specialist of oriental dances. 
It was an exciting life, heralded the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhist vegetarian and and plead for the abolition of corset which forbade the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman who marked history dance in Europe of the inter-war years, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
" I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last nominated me to interpret the dancer sévillane Tórtola de Valencia and it seemed to me to be incredible ". 
According to the dancer, " we are not trying to tell his life but to translate its way of thinking. 
The titles of its dancing made me think of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. 
For example, " the Dance of the moth " made me think back to a danse Cuban popular and dance the snake " to some tango. 
His dance sensuous was and they told me that my way to dance was identical to hers, " she says. 
The dramatization has made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who sing new Isabela in one of its shows, as he had to " The puerta abierta '; and that Professor Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally well wanted to cooperate with that which was his pupil. 
" Matilde transforms Tórtola in a mature figure. 
I am happy because it has agreed to play a role in my work and I honours. " 
The dramatization has also made thanks to music composition and the guitares of Jesús Torres are Paco Arriaga, popular song Michel Ortega, el Pulga are Moi of Morón; percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violates of Rafa El Viola and cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, " which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were regarded as " diva ". 
This practice tells also to a certain extent, the life of this woman who was present in places if distant, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, as it usually was in London. 
" I wanted the recall because I believe that it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights its work, " says Bayón. 
The spectacle begins to 8.30 theatre Lope of Vega 
The publication of the " Journal poet recently married " concludes the Triennat 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated the " Journal poet recently married " in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez has married with Zenobia thing in March, falls within the framework of the activities envisaged by the Ministry of Culture Andalusia to celebrate the " Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organised in order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for Littérature and their deaths. 
And in this way, the " Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " is coming to its end with the revival of this work with the International Congress which took place in New York, with the restoration of Nobel Museum and with exposure Goodwill " Juan Ramón Jiménez: this peuplier light " which was inaugurated last May and who, having travelled in the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.

America very fond less without Paul Newman 
" time God creates people perfect 
Paul Newman was part ". 
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in Absence of malice ", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and the whole of America, faced with the idea striking that Newman is no longer of this world. 
It was hard to obtain a Oscar 
It was for 2007 onwards. 
Everyone knew that it was ill. 
This was a hard blow for everyone. 
" sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend ", was Robert Redford, " my life and my country were better thanks to its existence ". 
Nobody was afraid of making ourselves ridiculous or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of the cinema and the homeland died during a period particularly unclear, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, think of US fell well bottom in desperate grounds of dignity. 
When times are hard and without reason to live, it only remains to human beings that admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda for love Paul Newman. 
It embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and defender lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the anti-drugs fight created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food. 
This was a victory for a country which has had scarcely impose against a suicidal food culture. 
This wave of admiration expansive balayait Hollywood without making attention the nationalities nor the passports. 
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, stated that any James Bond died before him. 
Whereas another Englishman, at the Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman marked the summit of his career. 
The bad boy happened Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to appoint Newman as its greatest inspiration. 
"It has placed the helm high ", was George Clooney, which is perhaps the only today trying to break the screen, as Mr Newman: by being very honnêt and with a serious privacy and further objectives. 
This is not always easy or possible in the media jungle nowadays. 
But there is anyone who tries, and Paul Newman is one example. 
After a divorce, it was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward were, which has been faithful even if the opportunities were it not for not be. 
"But why I should eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a beef in my ice? ", he used joke. 
The sky, he is with pride to meet its girls with its fans on earth, something which is not if usual in America. 
" among all the major roles he has interpreted, it has never been so proud that the husband dedicated, the father, the grandfather attentionné and philanthropist ", say it. 
Madrid in the race to 2016 Olympic Games 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organise the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved by 2016 
But I wonder whether we are prepared. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday: we are not! 
They call it the race perfect, but I believe that it was the worst race to which I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, these would be subject to a note éliminatoire. 
But look at all in detail and from the beginning. 
The mistakes are beginning with the withdrawal of dossards, who are obliged to go there in advance. 
It is not easy, but if they are you move this would be better than they give you all (including the electronic microchip for racing). 
And no 
They were you go there only to take the dossard (first mistake move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was that the size, if for the jersey (second mistake, because I have need of a size XL) 
In what world live us? 
East it to cause of the crisis they have decided to buy that small shirts with less fabric and suddenly cheaper? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day races. 
A from the fact that we must go there very soon to withdraw the electronic microchip, the queue is 15 minutes and, furthermore, it must leave his bag to back on entry. 
The expectation lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that 11 000 people are expected for these races. 
: has had a long queue, competitions have begun and we had not yet allowed our handbag back on entry, although once the withdrawal has been worse. 
Moreover, the rain has accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which took place of revolts and assaults baraque. 
I believe that approximately 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like myself, will be not even in the classification with the exact time, because the microchip they gave me which, I believe, has not properly marked the start. 
Of course, if they asked me to mention an example of race perfect, it I would certainly not to the idea. 
So I believe that we can still dream to become the host city for the Olympic Games 2016. 
Microsoft seeks a virtual while () 
The conference on the emerging Technologies MIT Microsoft was presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of Intelligence Artificielle with little intelligence but able to make some basic tasks, as call a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle for travel within the company campuses) in response to what asked at a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this " while " may know how many people there are in place, which they are - including remember what posts they occupy, and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations. 
But also lumping them according to groups of conversation 
In video presentation, while the detects a third person but it understands that it is not the group which is speaking with it and that it is not part of the company. 
It asks him if it is here to visit someone and it says that it will respond in a few moments. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which focus, for example on the next version of its operational system, Windows. 
This week we spoke in more of a change of strategy among Microsoft. 
Windows 7 is lighter and there is no longer as many programmes involved. 
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold to the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would five times faster. 
Which represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version has not ceased to added functions and " perks Windows ". 
The change of strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operational system loses importance but also its software. 
When Google Chrome happened on the network, I was one of those who has joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step from Google to compete to Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a workable system. 
The system operational will always be necessary because it is an essential basis for the hardware and software to understand. 
It is the same function that your woman or your husband when you say something to your mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
It will never be but we must see the " death of operational system not as an absolute truth but as a truth. 
This week Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
The people who are less and less attention to the operational system but increasingly on Internet browser. 
It starts the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing Internet than to go the windows. 
A used half applications provided with the system? 
Who can more can less. 
And Windows 7 must contain fewer applications, much less than Vista. 
Heavy farmed, month congested, less complex. 
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own on-line services so that they finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need this, indeed, and I shows you one example. 
The photograph present in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in a rest rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft to Redmond. 
On the distributor drinks, a poster their request to use their own research tool - " Ta research. our future '. 
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to seek information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not at the beginning of 2009, but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010 
Surely Microsoft will launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, increasingly resembling a computer. 
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them money. 
The Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in was in the European Diamant blood of Edward Zwick, even that Al Pacino in, the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association gays heavy-handed. 
And if we are to enumerate all its appearances, we could also cite this costaud moustachu which raise weight in a travelling circus. 
This is not just a swimming male body in cotton, milling and without sleeves. 
The English is there, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels differs among all the others. 
First of all, by its name rocket - although it is known by the name of Marcel - which has to do with sport as it takes the name, according to the myth, the boxeur Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
It is the Marcel differs from the other by its cotton excellent, by its thumb single-sex, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) that the shirts best-known body in the neck. 
But attention, because the Belgian marks does not only that of chat tank. 
But it also produces sweat - shirt, retro punch above its weight, cardigans cashmere, of trousers cotton, babies, mini - shorts... 
Clothes, designed to the comfort of underwear. 
Even if it is a pity to bring them just as underwear. 
They have too charm. 
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me " 
Its enormous similarities with his sister has not prevented to develop its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full vitality. 
At the sisters Cruz take seriously their new activity in the fashion. 
According to Monica, they are not that girls fine and famous who are devoting their name. 
It was present at the promotion that the marks Mango was in Paris at its new headquarters but and the presentation of the most important price of the way that the Spanish house sponsoring.

A day very intense but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us. 
On what basis your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season? 
The cinema of 50 years and 60 we recall and we copy much for our collections. 
I like very much to walk in city and observe women to see how they are clothed, how they combine their clothes, I often do. 
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a woman very versatile: is it not? 
I believe that yes but in the end everything is joined and these activities have much in common. 
Since I am tiny clothes please me; I be desired go to my grandmother to look in the filing of my corner and to see its clothes. 
It was crazy, almost better than to go to the theme park. 
Secondly, when I am become dancer, I always tried to take care of my way to pay. 
Dancers, like many of dress for prices and the tests, to look in the mirror and feel well. 
And in the role of actress, when you take clothing it is time that you have really put in the skin of man. 
Du blow, everything is linked. 
You are had there has long 30 years: it has been hard to you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years am delighted. 
I think the woman is more mature has more experience and are relishing life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock does not make me fear. 
I have made all the things that I wanted to make since tiny and it gave me great pleasure. 
So you think you you become mother? 
Of course, I want to become mother because my body wonder, and I want to become a young mother; I do not want to lose it. 
As regards the candidate, I do not worry. 
What I will do is give much happiness for my son and raise with great love. 
And so cinema, you expect the various films that you turned last year. 
That is true, I look forward that they come from. 
Someone who am a woman outcome of the theatre, I am very impatient and concerned, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible. 
I am looking forward that kind films, The última hora and, in busca of the tumba of Cristo. 
A see what you will 
There are a few days you started on the footbridge with Naomi Campbell, is it not? 
Do not say! 
I am not mounted on the bridge to the mannequin. 
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known for a long time, to invite me to participate in London a parade of charity for its association in favour of support to women and the clothing that we show - I have exhibited two clothes our collection created for Mango - were auctioned to collect money for the NGOs of Naomi. 
The people Naomi is a person at the heart strive. 
They say so much on it, I know, the many things are not true. 
Moreover, if good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
It has asked me to skulk away for a cause if noble, but if it had ask me to poirier, I would have done when even. 
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world. 
The recidivists of drink-driving must settle the system it is alcolock 
The interior minister wants the driver which took more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, has to settle in his vehicle a system which prevents start the vehicle drink driving, or if it does not. 
The initiative has already been announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is regarded as a pilot project which will last for one year. 
Its aim is reintegration of driver in proposing courses road re-education. 
The Minister of State responsible for road safety but also the Directorate General for the Routière Security and the Foundation Technological Institute for the security of the car will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having brought more than once in drink driving, includes the car. 
The alcolock would prevent this because it is a system connect on the vehicle which measure the level of alcohol in the affair, and prevents start the vehicle if the driver does not before; or when the rate of alcohol of the driver is higher than permitted. 
Its cost is higher than 1000 euros and is the burden of the driver. 
Here a study to the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with this system cut up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of installation. 
In Spain we believe that this could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure sticks to administrative sanctions for two reasons: face these behaviour before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary routes but, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law. 
The system is not yet available on the Spanish market under any form of trade, although some industrial vehicles and office has already a to experimental title. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the European Parliament will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to settle in school buses this system as this has been done in France.

There is certainly no appropriate place in the world to present a price fashion that Paris and there is certainly no cartoonist living more extraordinary and good live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen international image of new talent fashion. 
The winner will be rewarded by a cost of EUR 300. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian exit winner of the first edition, took its models in the window of Mango the 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and it was almost emotion. 
Although this is the second largest shop the marks in Europe which has just been opened with 1.335 square metres of surface. 
The first is shop in London. 
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, Chairman of the jury of competition, have found ourselves in a luxury dinner on the Garnier opera of Paris. 
With as table neighbour that the extraordinary family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed to be even more spectacular. 
In having with a heavy heart and against misfortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati has put a dress of Mango and a few parures of ELAH, who cut off, and hold arm in arm with his son below Luis - a good man of almost two metres high - it has accompanied Valentino his dinner prepared in its honour. 
Andik, the owner of Mango, a galant man, as Baron of Rotchil have finished the evening without shirt-sleeves because they had gone along with two women. 
Monica Cruz, who has presented to the shop with a trousers and a shirt - its own collection - and for the dinner has roll up our sleeves penitent by assuming a long sexy and black, has moved when during the visit of the night opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they have shown us the Chamber repetition of ballet and remembering the good old days, it has taken one sandbars and it made a gesture of the great complied. 
Mrs Sastre is not remained for the visit of palace dependencies, but it has shown us before on their mobile phone photographs of her son. 
The following morning, we have had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez - another good man who moves in motorcycle - and John Travolta, which came to the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with its an awful mess, its chaff and requested beforehand, that there was no smell in its chamber. 
Stars, under the starry sky of Paris. 
Oh, it is life. 
1001, the number antistress 
It is not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life. 
And to cap it all, they are all listed in a book which will bring us relax bookshops on 30 September. 
The clock saddens us almost when it sounds every morning at 7 hours, but it is even worse when we consider the pace waved that imposes on us the current life. 
The office is synonymous with tension and computer back pain. 
The stress represents evil of the 21st century. 
But there is neither a or two methods for combating everyday fatigue and the problems linked to the world of work. 
But much 1001 nor a more or less. 
A from the positions of yoga, the classic massage or treatment, spa, Susannah Marriott meeting in the pages of a book is all a menu of methods suited to the taste and time. 
The work antistress is entitled " 1001 ways to relax and happens among the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain the peace in place as the work or through personal relations, the handbook is belies such a belief. 
Moreover, this handbook offers other methods as contact with nature or of revenue 100% which help to relax you. 
If adrenalin does not focussed in trying to restore the balance of tone body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the canapé, disconnected from its spirit and focus on reading. 
Striking in sleeping 
Around children speak during the night. 
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by sharing something that happened the day before, but children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time that this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it does not matter. 
This is a benign alteration sleep is somniloquie. 
It is quite often, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is true that there are more than one who speaks for the night. 
This phenomenon can appearing very sporadic (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodic (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child remembers nothing. 
There is no single cause which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other changes of sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors, the night énurésies (out at lunch in bed) or the sleepwalking, but this is not always the case. 
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong fever, to situations of stress or become agitated. 
In any case it is a phenomenon extensively studied. 
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable. 
It may be that he speaks with a small voice calm, with isolated words, gasps or instead with shouts, tears, long speeches... 
In the case where the somniloquie becomes very frequently, it would be sensible to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to obtain an explanation to this problem. 
We have said that this is a benign alteration, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep which can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a apnée sleep or stressful). 
What we can do is take account of a number of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Essayer not heighten the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore seek circuses quiet and avoid programmes or television series which are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and who have barely relax, techniques of relaxation can be used to help to calm internally. 
This will enable children to have a more peaceful sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain calm. 
Such you that they are harmless to the child and the next day it will recall more of what happened. 
Useful Councils 
Do not the awake. 
It is superfluous is consciousness and you wake up. 
Even if he speaks, it lies and relies. 
Such you if it is very anguished several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes both anxiety among the child. 
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), have not the temptation of the question to obtain information. 
You will achieve nothing, because in sleeping, it is not aware to organise its thinking. 
Moreover, you will hear what he said, but you will not know what it is dreaming, suddenly heed the way in which you interpret information and the conclusions you draw from this. 
Ne say ever to child that you can ask during the night to know its secrets. 
Not even jokingly. 
That causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, do not worry, it is nothing of villain is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Finally Illhaeusern... 
Illhaeusern has finally found the path of the victory over its ground after a long period of famine. 
Without a great match, the Jaunes and black have created the greatest number of occasions and have managed to transform a match for the excess. 
The pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers have had difficulty to speak. 
After a first attempt of the captain visitor Kauffmann which verge on the lucarne firing on a far slightly Illhaeusern would take precedence and in turn Fonderflick far, then with Hirn above the Roman foot or even Diebold came tickle themselves the defence of Dannemarie. 
In face, was bloc in the middle of ground and it was just the great Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The start of second half would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to borrow a ball postponed on a first attempt to Diebold (53rd the). 
But the buteur Illhousiens cannot enjoy happiness long and will be obliged to regain the off a dozen minutes later and leaving its coéquipiers in digital inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not know benefit and will not cause serious problems at a eleven illhousien which has just receded a little for " compacter " its defence, except in the last few seconds of game where, after a big appear, the ball was the transversal very closely.

Obama, winner the points in the first television duel 
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House took over another for who, John McCain or Obama, has prevailed. 
Without surprise, the headquarters Republican campaign and a democrat proclaimed their own victory in this television duel which would have been followed by one third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, has not been enough " brilliant " to allow him to halt the decline in the polls to five weeks, the presidential elections. 
The institute a Gallup, whose opinion poll published on Saturday attaches advance of five points to Obama (49% against 44% to McCain), believes that it is the democrat who blew out of the game. 
Worldwide voters indecisive, which are those who are, Obama emerged as the winner for 39% of those questioned while 25% of them give victory to McCain, according to a survey CBS. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance on Thursday with the good provision expected of its colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with its rival, Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It is good instincts ", has however warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagénaire McCain has repeatedly put forward its indisputable experience in foreign policy, while emphasising the " naivety " his opponent on these issues which were at the heart of this first contest. 
"The Senator Obama appears not to understand that... " he accused has several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and expertise needed to be president", he also secured. 
A line of attack hammered out since yesterday in the Republican TV commercials. 
Obama, he pointed out that he represented the future. 
Without to dismantle, it has shown concise and precise. 
It has put forward its ability to take the right decisions, and to restore the image of the US in the world. 
" McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if", said, this weekend, a spot democrat accusing the Republican for not having taken full account of the impact of the crisis on the " American the streets ". 
" For the ninety minutes debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, has denounced Obama, yesterday, in 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an election rally in North Caroline under a hail flying. 
It has not even used the words " middle class " or " workers". " The rout financial clearly Obama advantage, which is regarded by the Americans as the most able to save the economy to the brink of disaster. 
" The coming week could be a watershed," believed, yesterday, the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer. 
The representative Rahm democrat Emanuel, a former the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts " Obama those Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirm that it achieved when even to reduce taxes 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, Senator of Illinois has also indicated that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country by the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system of health care. 
McCain, him, wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030 
Careful, the two candidates were ducked the questions on the bailout of 700 billion dollars (470 billion) adopted yesterday evening by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
A Minsk, " you have noticed that there was an election, you "? 
Youth and opponents were demonstrating Sunday evening on the main focus of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislation. 
Around hundreds of Belarussians met on Sunday night from the polling stations closed on the central place Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of legislation. 
Whereas no results had been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: " the dictator, resignation '. 
Some have not even admit voted: " A what good, they do what they want my voice," said a young. 
They do not believe that the regime which has done good is foreign observers to resume discussions with the European Union is prepared to carry out a democratic watershed. 
The sanctions, which the visa ban for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered own observers. 
They have not been according to the opposition. 
"We have been excluded electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the count ", deplored Iouri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous reunification twelve parties. 
"It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexander Milinkevich, former opposition candidate to the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important that counts the votes, and here is the executive. 
If the members of the opposition enter the parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into Parliament may mean the area on television, meetings in the regions and proposals of laws ". 
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " it must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, between in crisis, and that we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent ". 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the elections. 
It stresses that the figures on participation seem too high, and that the generalisation of vote by anticipation (26% of the electorate in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulation. 
"You have noticed that there was an election, you? wonder the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those which best suit in power ". 
The silence of the night falls on the place of October. 
A television, President Lukashenko and the members of the central electoral commission welcome their success. 
The meeting - Du blood become course 
Héma-Québec yesterday was celebrating the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, the Dre Francine Décary, had reason to be pleased, because Héma-Québec has become one of the suppliers of blood more effective and the security of the world. 
And, above all, it has regained confidence of the public who had been seriously damaged by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As you know, the national reserves of blood transfusion service managed by the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the virus (immunodeficiency HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
But this drama and the public resentment, the Canadian Government has established in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Krever giant, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster does not happen again. 
Whereas the judge Krever delay to submit its report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed to plan a new system of management of blood in Canada. 
The Quebec, the Committee Gélineau has fulfilled this mandate. 
Following the reports Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Company blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls the Dre Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years which followed, we have regained public confidence ', it says before proudly say that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population Quebecois of was now confidence in Héma-Québec. 
The Dre Décary guard however in mind that confidence is something extremely fragile ". 
So its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time it was in Europe hatching many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells which takes the strong since its foundation in 1998 
"And we did not know whether this disease could be transmitted by blood. 
It is then relied on one of the main recommendations reports Krever and Gélineau that when one does not know, and that a serious illness can ensue, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is characterised by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, it introduces measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, we therefore refused the blood of the people who had been more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 
But there are a few years, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode we thus showed that the precautionary principle that has been applied had sense ". 
In 1999 appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive HIV screening tests: the acid nucléique (TAN) which detect directly in blood donors the presence of the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, on which calculating tests used hitherto. 
The TAN have enabled us to shorten the period silent, which extends between the time when the person has been infected and when the first virus can be detected in blood by our technical, explains the specialist. 
We could reduce this period to less than a week. 
It has thus substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without the knowledge and that we can detect. 
These improvements have enabled us to reduce considerably the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of receive contaminated blood by HIV. 
"In other words, this means that we must distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more 24 years before occurs a case of HIV transmission a blood products. 
I believe that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health ', says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
We never knows what pathogenic will emerge in the system. 
Not later than last year appeared on the island of Réunion the virus Chikungunya who, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by a insect in blood. 
It must be constantly vigilant ", pursues the Dre Décary before stress that security of supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply. 
"The needs increase because the population is ageing. 
The anti-cancer treatment being more aggressive patients have often need a recharge in red leucodepletion or pamphlet. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which brings together on average only 3% of Québécois allowable blood donation ". 
Anyone in health, aged 18 years and more responding to the eligibility criteria can give blood all 56, six times a year. 
In average, 14% of people offering blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded during a period of one year. 
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory which meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give blood. 
But it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, but above all to detain and encourage them to become regular donor. 
The life of today being unbridled if there is rarely the time an hour to give blood ', regrets Décary Francine. 
With an annual budget of EUR 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue, including bone graft, heart valves, eye world and skin that is almost exclusively used for the major burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before be deposited in Héma-Québec which administers the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord which was once considered a biomedical waste full of a blood rich in stem cells can be used to deal with serious diseases, such as leukaemia. 
"One celebrated, there are a few weeks, the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and take it provides more 000 per year. 
We should start to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, " specifies the Dre Décary which describes this programme to levy of umbilical cord blood as very popular. 
" no Several are disappointed cannot access ", because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this programme complex and costly in every hospital Quebec. 
Soccer - The Impact in semi-final

But I think he appreciated the end of the game. 
It has been a beautiful standing ovation ". 
Charest placing on the North 
The Prime Minister does not exclude trigger elections before the end of the year 
Immediately after the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest went yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to elect the by-election today. 
"to postpone the limits of our last great the northern border ": that is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining within the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech was thrown a sort of Moulin to images. 
Turn in circle, on three huge screens, clichés spectacular hydroelectric dams, mining, of Quebec seen by " Google Maps ", maps, etcetera. 
Large resources, as electoral period. 
In point of press, moreover, the prime minister has refused to exclude it would trigger the elections this autumn, even if he remarked that its timetable was very responsible. 
" North Plan " is the fourth part of a " vision that Prime Minister claims to have for the Quebec, a new" economic area ", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speech by Prime Minister recently, the opening of the north - the northern territory the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister has however resorted to explain why the north was " a jewel in the huge potential ", but has not given a deadline, amounts of investment, or priority in the future projects. 
To some Avenue what could be developed further: particularly hydro-electricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, has boosted by the growth of emerging countries and reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
" The North contains nickel, zinc, copper, platine, however, money, iron, titane, and even diamonds ', according to the list of Mr Charest. 
This " territory twice great as France", "it is among us is in Quebec. 
Not only is among us, but it is with us, "he insisted, as to show that it was asking a national myth. 
The Quebec has much built in its relationship with the north, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, engineering, the Bay Quebecois of James. 
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, having made a pause theatrical to look at the immense card behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory Quebecois of, includes a section Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the Prime Minister at the point of press. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated. 
There is a line of border on which there is no understanding for very long, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government, "he has indicated. 
The rest, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North, he said about the changeover North-West, which will begin the whole year due to the melting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, Prime Minister think occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of territory, the First Nations and the Inuits? 
The Prime Minister has said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the draft their benefit, especially for young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member péquiste of Ungava), have already started consultations with thirty communities. 
A EU committee chaired by Benedict members and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources) has an important place began its work. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, " not necessarily a summit ', but a time when " there will be a common vision. " 
The development of North would be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North Plan will concerted ", ordered and respectful of the environment," he has promised. 
Jean Charest described this " vision as continuity with the first Minister Liberals which preceded it. 
"As liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development ". 
This has been one of the themes of the end of this week, which has begun Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois in Central Barrage Adélard-Godbout. 
" De Godbout, which has created Hydro-Québec, Lesage who has done the quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, Bourassa who has done the Bay James, our party has managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest. 
In point of press, he invoked another reference, conservative this, the programme "Road to the North " of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to. 
In addressing the draft dam hydro-electric power of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its operation was scheduled post-2012. 
" it is us here, but I foresee be," he has entrusted to its militants, causing home the applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not excluded the possibility of triggering a ballot this autumn, what the law allows it. 
It stresses that its timetable is however fulfilled, especially by a mission of the advice of the federation in China and a summit Québec-New York. 
The General Council of the end of this week has provided the Liberal leader a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which are spent as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular recognition " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution. 
It also hope that Quebec appoints of Council members of broadcasting and telecommunications Canadian and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
Du side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad lines of Plan North with scepticism. 
The head péquiste, Pauline Marois, has emerged the development policy - the North - Quebec that the government Landry was launched in 2001 
According to it, the Liberal Government, in coming to power in 2003, has refused to apply. 
If it did, it would be more advanced today " has commented on Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in Jean-Talon (elections taking place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ said support the adoption of Plan north by the government. 
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle ", has commented on the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, rightful holiday today. 
De Letras - one country dishonoured 
It is Mr Vic Toews, the former Minister of Justice " (ironically) in the cabinet Harper, who allowed last summer to say Louise Arbour that it was a" shame " for Canada. 
'Building and aspersions on this woman who led this unending struggle for justice and which deserves our admiration says so long on the entourage Prime Minister on Stephen Harper itself. 
We find ourselves in a government which is the only, among all the Western countries involved, not to have returned its national locked in the concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
A government which takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges on which they are accused. 
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves spent rotting in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only which turns to a travesty of justice to assess the culpability of the accused. 
Basically, for the record that UNICEF, international calling and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, argue for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that it enjoys a fair trial in Canada. 
It is this same government who condone torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, without doubt, ever after many years of violence. 
We are not yet, but at the moment we are seeing a insidiously erosion of our rights, our freedom and our " democracy", this word that Harper constantly brandishing and whom if hollow in his mouth. 
This is the time where no moral no longer exists: we can push, torture, to imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a Head of Government minority hitherto (what will happen after the 14 October...). 
Many people believe that they will find salvation in a which extols the Vertu, the Law and the Bar: they do not see that this government has renounced what was the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, it is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September, The Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Pursue an Orwellian logic, it says that the greatest aurifère company in the world has brought a continuation defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the penny in order to launch a " public debate transparent ". 
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way of conducting a public debate be lead to the ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own? 
Irrespective of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the book black Canada have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, weapons very unequal, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without substance of the mining. 
The tactics, in these battles unequal, is often ruining the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement which b' illonnera opposition in addition to frighten anyone who would dare to re-examine the question. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, it is to the public that it should have presented his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is done in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not at the expense of club. 
It therefore to the mining to open its books, its files and establish a genuine debate, through the newspapers, the media publications and financing of independent research teams which could shed light on the matter. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects dismissing petitions and letters of support to the authors of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how it can ask for a debate "public while ignores the views of this same public? 
In the world of Vice-President, it seems that this word designates only lawyers highly paid and not all the Canadians; that is a view rather close the concept. 
In democracies, even the critics have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or does not understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of black Canada the fact above all because it rejects the brutal manner the mining. 
This public is prepared to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, and not in the framework of what several perceive as a further - b' illon (pursuing the " public debate", Barrick Gold has also submit a formal notice to the place of the authors of black Canada them, to stop the use of this term...). 
The surréel quasi-State speech Mr Garver, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society. 
It denies, en bloc, the right to the quotation from sources credible and the debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues which dislike the rich companies in the world in a country such as Canada, on pain of prosecution repetition, who will be able to do this? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate and transparent, it could do so following the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada. 
It has a right of reply. 
The academic world, to which we belong, has long been known manage the debates and the disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
Taking Barrick Gold uncontrollable clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire a debate transparent. 
It is a loss for the academic world, just as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place arrangements restricting this kind of prosecution abusive. 
Operation rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans wheel-and-deal 
The Bush administration and the heads of the Congress, both Republicans and democrats, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan to 700 billion US dollars aimed at stopping the financial crisis affecting Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress. 
It includes: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for lack of payment, and a right to scrutinise the salaries paid to the leaders of companies rescued. 
The Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi should be invited, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Gregg Judd, have announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon negotiations two days. 
"We have made great progress in terms of an agreement which will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done so shelter the real economy and the Americans ordinary the ongoing crisis in Wall Street ', explained the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and the upheavals on the daily lives of the Americans will be immense," said the Republican Gregg Judd. 
The negotiations had turned the sprint in the last few hours by fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on the mood of investors. 
The time limit that we had paid was the opening up of markets this morning. 
Involve late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, without fail, however, to express their dissatisfaction that one is obliged to achieve this. 
The Democrat Senator Obama has awarded the addition of certain provisions understanding, particularly aimed at enabling owners to retain their homes and that on the salary of leaders from companies by the state. 
"When we request the taxpayer to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not much to be welcomed. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on American television. 
Consider another channel for whether it would vote for the proposed plan, his opponent Republican, John McCain, replied: " I would like to see the details, but I hope that " yes. 
"The broad lines that I have read ] [ show that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we shall be able to move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, he said. 
The 700 billion aims to buy with taxpayers' money dubious claims, active and unsaleable American financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months a crisis triggered by the break-up of a property bubble has led to the collapse of mortgage credits at risk (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit institutions (PCAA) and lead to a freeze liquidity and on the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans who wrecked the first draft agreement last week. 
It believes be taken out of this impasse since democrats have accepted that assets toxic "" companies in difficulty are only assured by the government, rather than bought. 
Order of getting round for everyone in Congress, we have added a provision that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes designed to help to recover its implementation. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion which will add another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion should be ratified by another vote of Congress. 
In exchange of its aid, Washington yields contributions in companies rescued which apply dividends in case of profit and that it can sell when the storm will be passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures for seized on housing attached to the mortgages, concerned by this plan, and to set limits on remuneration and starting allowances paid to the leaders of the companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would see put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and that of the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not even certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Votes, have indeed continued to protest against this project, both in the Republican camp that democrat. 
" and Washington do not hear you," said to his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not one which is to take advantage of taxpayers '. 
Promoter of a small group in Congress nicknamed the sceptics Caucus "," the representative democrat Brad Sherman present things differently, but comes to the same conclusion. 
" four hundred eminent teachers of economy, including three Nobel Prize, wrote to tell us: we ask the Congress of not hurry and carefully examine the path to take, he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, we had once again proof of the global nature of the crisis. 
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial assumption of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would acquire its competitor in full sinking since she has lost 2 billion (2.9 billion US) in the crisis mortgages at risk in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of twenty major European banks and ten biggest insurers. 
"It is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is precisely something savers and households now appreciate that the time forebodes uncertain ". 
While on the other side of the Channel, the British Government seemed path to nationalise another bank disrupted by the financial crisis. 
In the English press, the government would take over the whole loans underway among the bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion (75,5 billion US) mortgages. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is she who would buy branches and the accounts customers of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British Government should nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) - Death of an icon committed 
His beauty in the eyes of azur was long its card asset, some will say its weakness. 
If it was liberated from mirror narcissique, the American player in smile charmer? 
Yes and no. 
His propriety, its sensitivity and talent flowing source will have also far removed from the register of power which actually giving rise to the real monsters sacrosanct. 
But what great long-distance athlete! 
Mr Newman, disappeared Friday in 83 years, as a result of lung cancer in its invite him the Connecticut, remains one of the last icon of American cinema of good years. 
That Brando monumental farmed, which was long and he was a kind of rival to the screen, more cautious in its game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the break-up of dramatic conventions. 
The agonizing involved are often children wonderful. 
It is born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin. 
De these European roots will generate a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without egos ultimate disproportionate quality mark. 
Because in him rushing a freedom-loving countries of self made man, the combating of the Pacific War, injured, which in the early 1950s on dramatic art Yale can attend the Actor' if Studio in New York, before prevail in the theatre, television, soon the cinema. 
This same man who campaign for the civil rights was also the pilot cars, which place second the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled to appealing symbol, albeit a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward were. 
Disappear with him the grey areas in this secret star, discreet committed, the rows of allergic show - business, which is not entirely holes the puzzle. 
A honest man, in the widest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has provided the swindle the cinema goers later this week, while collide its major roles on the screen black memories. 
More half a century of a seventh art American more ever-changing through him. 
Return compete in memory the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting sensuous his wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a roof burning adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958 
Plus close to us (1990), its sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed to his old age by a marriage, which does not fulfil all its promises. 
Both other Paul Newman switched to history. 
This boxeur Rocky Graziano, offender, plagued, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Dr (mark by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, adopted after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956 
This malfrat appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (The Arnaque), Oscar the best film in 1973 
Billard player avenger by bitter and in the magnificent The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the person on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who won him in 1987 its sole Oscar on nine appointments. 
This face through the ages, it was him. 
They him. 
The times are through its journey. 
The young people are especially through the cultissime Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach a team Ice Hockey unorthodox. 
Its fans have recovered in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen. 
With one last role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to distress of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was completed. 
In several cinema legends which chèrent early enough the profession, Newman will saddle remained long, while denouncing Hollywood, its on its good, and its concessions. 
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier regarded, not without humour, " as a living challenge to the" underplaying " judging its services too. 
The profession has not always been strive for the beautiful Paul Newman the roles fell long all cooked in the tooth. 
It played less often young people first that the marginal: névrosés, alcoholics, swines or desperate, including its features perfect reflect the fads and revolts. 
As film-maker Newman reveal facets badly known its true euphemistic sensitivity. 
Its Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel the Canadienne Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward were in the main role, an end contour map female portrait of melancholy. 
Mob who lost his son Scott by overdose him dedicate his film Harry and its in 1984, work of propriety and sad. 
Among the rain of tributes which be launched yesterday on Newman, its great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: " His presence has made my life and this country best ". 
Generosity, love of the existence of distress traits of the actor disappeared. 
Beyond his career of myth, disappears also a great civil rights activist, ecology, cinema independent, a critical of the excesses of Hollywood. 
It has seen much its binette allowed to grace pots of vinaigrette, sauces, jammy and other foodstuffs, assessing the process of poor taste, albeit joke initially. 
The profits of these sales were nevertheless paid to its Foundation for childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on its myth, will have committed until the end. 
It gave its five girls a letter containing these sentences: " Still and until the end, your father was incredibly recognising its good star. 
It was a privilege to be ". 
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of a US artist if lucid and if generous. 
Citizens' model, in short and in addition. 
What could well make Zuschlag & Society in their factory in bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will start the hearings relating to the criminal proceedings underway, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and its accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organisation, permanently and regularly, having led to the damage particularly important. Other charges have been adopted against them, for example, false and use of false. 
Judging by the public prosecutors, money from subsidies, was spent for personal ends, while the benefits were justified by false bills. 
The money of the state and of municipalities, approximately 65 million HUF in total, was on the one hand in the coffers of the Fiatal movement Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pockets of certain people. 
Their method, made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to receive the money subsidies obtained in making invoices expense, behind which no real provision was provided and thus associations never meet their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of invoices were untrue. 
For them, they - full market bills Józsefváros, while they manufacture stamps to Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies which would be on bills, it was decided, among others, during touring province of Northern Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on the request of János Zuschlag. 
According to the evidence, it should identify pensions and restaurants. 
For its personal consumption, he asked a bill, on the model of which they realization other bills that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the municipality of the Capital of subsidies. 
The majority of invoices was created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, which according to our information, cared especially to draw up the dossiers necessary to obtain subsidies. 
When a circuit " direction-finding ", a choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 members of the association Biztos Pontos Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people occupy this place, at the same time. 
De the same way, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, which later will bear the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, grouillait of mistakes of forms and of substance. 
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, did in fact that three chambers, and maximum ten people could spend the night. yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers. 
The issuers of bills on the overly imaginative are also fallen into excesses, when they mentioned society Pigal Kft, even the hotel and catering sector. in their accounts nor the name of Jobb Jövőért, or the Hoppá there appeared, according to the information to the public prosecutor's office. 
Győző Farkas the manager of society, has said in hvg site. p. hope that when the public prosecutor's office has convened and has shown bills, it has been able, immediately, that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp ". 
It added: ") Aside from the form, the fact that according to the bill, one hundred people have housed, not very truthful headline either, since this establishment only eleven chambers, who do not have as much room. 
Moreover, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant is closed long ". 
The issuers of zealous bills are not informed on travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. so naively, they have indicated stays of Hungary on invoices to settle in species, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency. 
De surcroit, as it emerged during the investigation, they also add VAT on these documents, while the provision concerning the activities of trips, whose destination is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT. 
Likewise, the rate of VAT on four invoices established on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the benefits of society detest VAT 25% as indicated, but VAT of 15%. De more, employees in the emit hotel bills printed, while the false were prepared to hand. 
The public prosecutor the inquiry shows that the " issuers " also have made mistakes by mentioning as provision the carriage of goods by road, that sending society bills could not exert, given that its profile was the advice in investment. 
Moreover, it is also for the defects of forms, as types of invoices inadequate and false stamps, that the invoices the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pontos proved to be false. 
Just as in the case of society Ravenna Bt. or sporting vesting Kunfehértó, which both deny be the authors of invoices in their name. 
The money launderers have not paid attention to the fact that society HIB Kft., established to Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (2001) the Group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to dined home. according to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidateur society denies issued this bill. 
Bill established deliberately 
A group of other issuers of invoices is composed of those who were fully aware that it was asked to give of invoices. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a bill the order of the Foundation Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, for an amount of EUR four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of society Collab Kft. was led to make false bills by one of the accused, Györfi Orlando. 
Likewise, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, society Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and 2003 has issued invoices the order of the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of around five million HUF, but behind which no provision has actually been provided. 
No financial movement has taken place, not more, given that the invoices were cancelled by the result, however, the bodies have avoided the mention in their accounts. 
The category of issuing companies bills is that companies directly linked to accused. 
For example, the administrative delegate the Director-General of society Trió Delta Kft., caring fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was non-existent, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, this company has produced several bills concerning the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of around EUR 18 million HUF. 
According to the investigation, such equipment have been bought by society Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005 
The Director of this society was a man of Romanian origin, who Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents in connection with society, between 2002 and 2005 
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation he has expressed bills on the order of societies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and he has earned their countervalue. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian bricklayers created companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. 
In fact, none of those societies worked, what the accused explained by the fact that they were not work. 
It served when even these companies, since at the request of Maître Zsolt Szente, coaccusé and editor acts of foundation of societies, it has established invoices their names, the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov gave organisms, 15 invoices in total, made by companies Cash Investment, Trió Delta, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, to a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The public prosecutor's office believed that 10% of are indicated on bills and VAT in the pockets of Kubatov. 
The man has even used society Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious bills which have been used in the framework of the grant application of Biztos Pontos. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért have introduced a request of subsidy to the body of public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI). 
They have achieved this subsidy for an amount twice HUF 500, but these have not been used for the objectives indicated in demand. 
To ensure that this does not happen know, five fictitious bills received from society Works Team Kft. were presented in MRI. 
Besides, it is these bills which have been found in the raid on the office of Árpád Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, part of the accused to reconstruct the method of manufacture of invoices, as it had already done before the floor earlier. 
What could be genuinely interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag itself, decides to lift the veil on history. 
So far, its admissions are not very detailed, and although it has promised on several occasions tell the detail, he has not yet done. 
The question is whether it is in its interests or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement whereby in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only the hat. 
Today, it is probably offended, since the requests for its investment under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction of its conditions of detention, constantly fall on deaf ears. 
During that those who have caused damage much more important, and the authors of economic crime, not repairable, roam freely or at least expect their own home the end of the procedure. mob has not this possibility. 
The psychology of one-upmanship: why are we spending more money? 
In auctions and buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
The researchers neurology and economy of the University of New York have managed to update the foundations neurological and economic behaviour known and apparently irrational. 
According to their study published in magazine Science, human beings do not want to be dependent at this type of competition, as for example an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price. 
These investigations have tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this type of so-called stake " to aid experimental auction. 
A voluntary groups plays lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), researchers studied the brain areas assets experimental subjects. 
In the two games, participants could earn money, but during the auction which an essential element is the surfeit of a third, the whole situated under the waistline brain damage, called striatum, was being movement intensive way at the loss of the part. 
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of " car " - stimulation of the nervous system. 
That is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is with the flight before the violent reaction of striatum. 
A support their theories economists, members of this group of researchers have pursued analyses of financial supervision. 
In these three groups gold-plate faced with a partner, in various circumstances. 
They have simply informed the group control of the real value of the product in question, and they have done their implementation. 
A another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were digging winner of the part, then they would receive USD 15 additional, reward. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lost this money, in cases where they lost auctions. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed in the one on the victory, while on the other, on the failure. 
In demonstrating the assumption of neurologist, members of the team of players "against failure " were prepared to put higher than those made by the group control and group "for the victory ". 
" These results cannot be demonstrated by any economic theory already exists. 
Because each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk. 
Only the methods neurological imaging helped remove the contradiction between the two theories, leading, now, on a third explanation. " - found Andrew Schotter, Professor ability of economics of the University of New York. 
The hepatitis: when we must consult a doctor? 
In the world, around half a billion people suffering from hepatitis B or C chronic, whereas in Hungary, the chronic disease liver is mentioned among the main causes of death. 
Estimated 100 miles patients carriers of the virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment., of the fact that often patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus. 
The designation hepatitis is a generic name given infections affecting the liver and caused by various virus. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the jaunisse are characteristics, but pathogens and disease caused differ from each other. 
The virus of hepatitis, according to the genes pathogens, mindlessly mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or contaminated water), the hepatitis B, C and D and other virus by blood and organic liquid (sperm, vaginale secretion, spittle). 
For travellers, in any case it is advisable to get inoculated against viruses A and B. It is no vaccine against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed, in general, accompanied by a bad state of weakness, evils of stomach and nausea. 
Secondly develops on the skin and on the white eye a jaunisse visible, the saddle become clearer and urine takes a colour more charge. The cure can take two to three weeks. 
A throughout the world, each year, a million people die of the worst form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main cause is that according to estimates, only a ill on ten receives medical treatment. 
The hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
The majority of patients is not widely known reached the virus, because the gene destroys pathogenic underhand way cells. liver in many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years. 
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: the people who have suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, consumers of drugs and the tatoués. 
Current figures to 200 million people suffering from hepatitis chronicle of type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by an examination of routine in laboratories, it is advisable to consult a doctor dealing with from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is warned. 
On 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, organised for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representing the sick of the four corners of the world. 
Its purpose is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and on the importance of the early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone who is growing in God it feels less pain? 
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would operate as a kind of painkiller, which would have already contributed to making more bearable death martyrs Catholics. 
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers from Oxford University have done an interesting experience in analysing at what level the belief in God could influence tolerance in the grief of human beings. 
In the framework of this experience for the bizarre Catholic, 12 believers and unbelievers have been subjected to ECT, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, believers Catholics were able to exclude a large part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation the human brain, was also able to discover that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains responsible for regulating the pain. 
This analysis is the first in a series of experience, that of academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university. 
More precisely, experience goes as follows: an instrument issuing sparks and disseminating ECT is set on the left hand of experimental subject. 
Scientists asked the participants experience to look way supported two paints, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato the 17th century and the other, the Lady the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci on 15ème century. 
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that view of the Virgin Mary mentions a sort of status of faith among the believers, while the choice of paint of da Vinci, not so very different from the first was on its calming effect. 
The trial subjects have spent half an hour in MRI scanners, and meanwhile, have received 20 ECT in four part, while looking after the paint religious issue, the more general. 
The Catholics said that in view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as " safety", as someone whose we " takes care " and they are " quiet, and peace has invaded ". 
A view paint thematic of religious, they have realised 12% of pain in less than when they were watching the work of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, which itself has taken part in the experience, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image among atheists, provided to find the appropriate photo. 
"We should find an image which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research. 
" The practice of faith should change and in many cases, indeed our personality exchange ", has added Wright. 
After these excellent results, it is more than the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of pain issues if it shows a Madone believers painted by Leonard or by a painter the same arms? 
Will the sight of a Virgin Mary better quality would lead to better results? 
You are what you disclose to tone subject 
During its tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of the people in the same way as the skies over their heads. it knows where they have spent their holidays, which experts consult and what are their centres of interest. 
This is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, which is one of those who have influence of society. 
Whereas as regards the sceptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, they do not see the bulk of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main ambition Google is to gather more information about its users. which is necessary for the founders of Google can respect their original purpose which read as follows: " collect in a system all the information the world! ". 
Judging by the leader of Google questioned, after ten years of a global chamboulement, they are still the start of their objectives to treat all information. 
The question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt has replied that he would like Google can respond to questions such as " what I might make tomorrow? " or " What is the work would be the better? ". but software cannot respond to this type of question, simple at first glance, that the day when they know enough about users. 
It is not quite clear to all surfers that the words used for research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer launching research and the pages consulted by the interested parties are precisely listed. 
And the intermediary of the programme Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, to store their own history of research and can consult what they have sought, on what they visit. thanks to this, in the long term, recommendations programme, based on the same logic, will be able to give answers much more isolated, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences recorded. 
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if we look at what is my work? call for users, who are worried seeing the monopoly on information from Google. 
In most cases, is power potential represented by society, which can create fear, and this is not the compunction, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power which may arouse surfers against - reaction. 
It is nonetheless a fact confirmed that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are forwarded to a third, and in this type of case law, nothing protects the personal rights of their customers. 
The example the resounding more of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google forwarded the Brazilian Government the information he had gathered on page public Orkut called, thus enabling an identification. 
The Internet users mindful of the rights of the person were able to breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, arms head with the body of legal protection EFF electronic, has proved its right to court against the FBI. according to the judgment, in the future, Google can still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on demand FBI secret, of whatever kind. 
(at the same time, the federal government has achieved successfully addresses some 50 000 web and 1000 terms of research that he had won by the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years ago. but in the end, it fails to acquire the lists of investigations of private users, or the whole list of websites and keywords in these last two months.) 
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticised by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate and private sector suffer when they begin to use services Google. and therefore they address them in the spirit of revolt it evident against multinational companies proud of their image conservative. 
During this time, culture geek American and its " sauvageons " with the fans, activists and users enthusiastic about the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of big business, the " fashionable corporation ", by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, classified as invader of the world because of Windows, even if all the two are fighting for the same objective. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, do not ask to its users of identification code, not asking for money for its applications. The code documentary and the package of programmes, continually refreshing, has a much more accessible, younger and more cool, faced with the practice of official giant of software. 
. The reason may also be that the geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed in recent years, precisely behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something else that cooperation, that the fact that we allow intentionally traces behind us, and that we serve communication channels available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: are exposed. 
A young, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, Facebook to Xanga, and it can even linking them to other benefits, such as Twinter, or to last. f metre listing musical habits. then it can connect them to a tracking system, as FriendFeed or Blip. f metres these young people can also hold bloggers automatically, in which appear their most recent galleries of pictures they stock on Flickr or on Picasa. 
For that we can take knowledge many examples, such as that of the small friend who can easily understand the view photographs of the morning, taken by the circle of friends, with common which his friend unfaithful has spent the evening, or the society which has dismissed one of its employees, nothing that for opinions sincere that he wrote on his blog about the top management, it can be on one thing: the term privacy is totally to reconsider nowadays. 
Which living a life online, is composed of what it shows itself, and that is how we can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of young people today. 
Which wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the system of research Google, but, at the same time leaving intentionally no trace). 
The number of people who deliberately, does not have on public pages for that it is not possible to locate them, is not insignificant. The Google on-line services, via the treatment of text the treatment of image to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to enormous servers parks and which do not come together our best profile, having existed to date. 
The public expects, without really is hide, when Google revealed its true nature. 
The society, with its present value of 156 billion dollars, is more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion). advertising sectors AdWords/AdSense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of increasingly important cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
However, the critical observers, alongside this, the contradictions with effects worrying: for example, the top management of society has refused, in its entirety, protests employees, after it has doubled the price of the tongue of enterprise and after that society has judged too expensive restoring daily multiple taken at any time. Everything this seems ridiculous to hand the fact that in 2006, Google has assented to the Chinese Government and according to the terms of their agreement, society detect all the results which injure good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to a of internal rules of society, the new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is on is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. For that some believe that the draft scan and archiving of books and magazines dimensions Google is so important that society will shortly find themselves facing the Supreme Court of the United States, other scenes before its system Health, because in it, we can build a full medical benefit from our previous results of analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google plays a basis of genetic data can give a good raw material for the next generation of authors of fiction. The novel the famous Cory Doctorow, written with a half - Orwellian tone, described the future in which a man could be approached so nothing outrageous that through the data of Google. 
Two minors have helped to remove the traces of dual homicide of Ózd 
" The police convened two minors to interrogate them in the case of dual homicide of Ózd. according to suspicions based, they have helped to remove the traces of crime. " - said the spokesman of the police station Department of Borsod. 
The young have recognised the facts with which they are accused. for the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, which, according to the information of MTI (Agency Télégraphique Hungarian) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The complicity of murder can causing a detention of up to 5 years. 
The suspect of dual homicide of Ózd, a young man who corner of 23 years, has been placed in custody, Sunday. 
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest. 
Durant the investigation, it proved that the young man of 23 years should a large sum of money to man 53 years. 
The suspect did not settle its debt and it is for this reason that it drew its creditor, last Wednesday in a website Ózd where it has killed, and the little girl of this man, aged 9 years. 
According to the information MTI, the young man has premeditated his crime. The weapon with which it was committing its hidden crimes on the scene of the crime is proof. 
The police examines the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of experts. 
The stock Warsaw made a proposal for the takeover of the stock of Prague 
The stock exchange of values of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million approximately five billion kronor Czech, for the purchase of 100% of the package of actions of the stock market values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the stock market values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that Poles have made despite that, previously, the Czech Republic have excluded the stock of Warsaw the circle of potential new owners of the stock of Prague. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the stock of Warsaw lies in the hands of the state. 
99% of actions are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to secede from more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activities. 
According to the newspaper Czech economic E15, the Polish proposal represents the most that has been made until now for the purchase of the stock of Prague. 
According to the press, the Czech stock Vienna, the transatlantic stock exchange NASDAQ, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the stock of Prague, said last week that amongst those involved, the stock exchange of Warsaw would be the new owner the less good, and has not excluded the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the stock of Prague in the future. 
The value of the stock of Prague is estimated at between EUR 5 to 10 billion kronor by the Czech market specialists. 
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of papers are sold. 
The most important owner of the stock of Prague is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25% of holdings, followed by the FF 14.7 per cent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S.. r. the. with 13.5%. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
In their comments of Tuesday, dedicated to the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, newspapers leaders of the European press evoke already a " second 11 September ". 
" The overall financial disaster, we must the American president '- accuses the everyday lives of Rome, La Repubblica. " The President has not even been able to shoulder to shoulder with his own party behind a draft law, improvised hurriedly, designed to help a depressing situation... " 
A the place of a new Pearl Harbour mentioned, as the billionaire Warren Buffetts -- hard-driving businessmen, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September. 
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, are the failings of the political direction of there which has led the world economy on the verge of collapse. 
The risk of the collapse of the financial system US track every day, and afterwards, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush was far from perfect, however according to the vote the congress, a real threat that Washington does not propose to political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The global economy hangs in a vacuum, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place. 
We cannot ignore the threat longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states can still be a lifebuoy for their financial bodies health, and thanks to their own taxpayers' money, they can save them of bankruptcy. 
Of course, if even more banks collapsing such domino, then or financial resources, or new extemporisation, will not be sufficient. 
A long term, we need the states of the European Union do little case of their national egoism and they centralising control above the financial markets divided. 
Nothing that on Monday, financial organizations weakened have received more than 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will duty to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, similar to the American way in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really occupied the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is experiencing, hand in hand, the old continent. 
The " rescue forces wearing " must not brandish immediately 100 billion, by against this would be good if they note in which case it would be sensible to affect the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing larger damage. 
The following intelligent car theft of bourdon 
What method would be best to develop technologies able to avoid an obstacle, if this is the imitation of a detector existing obstacles in nature? 
For example, that of bees. 
In the draft surprising presented during the CEATEC, with Japan, bees bourdonnantes gave the strategic idea of departure engineers from Nissan, for the inspire on how they should develop the next generation of detectors obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system car command - organic robotisé - inspired, type BR23C, he has equipped qualities of bees, the final objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of preventing all obstacles. 
In its flights, each bee is its own area, form, oval, which in reality, is very similar to our hull secure protection - has explained, at exposure, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations of the mark. 
The eye to facets of the bee plays an important role, since it is able to see in all directions, in a corner of 300 degrees. 
To imitate the functions of the eye to facets, engineers have approached the idea of télémètre to laser beam. 
, which identifies the obstacles in a corner of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends out a signal to the microchip logs, which the transformed into manoeuvre avoidance immediately. 
The perception of the obstacle has held in a split second. then the mini robot car, mimicking movements of the bee immediately change the direction of his works in the shift from one angle sufficient to prevent the collision. 
Contrary to any system that currently exist, avoidance this manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctively. 
"If it was not the mini robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle '- explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratoire Mobilité and the project robotisée car. 
It must react instinctively and instant, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable section and within the envelope of protection, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
Everything process must reflect what the bee done to avoid other bees. 
The process must take place in a wink. 
A against the bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonal, it cannot be that two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
So instead of infinite combinations that possess bees to prevent other bees, in our case, there has been able to use that the movement rotatif, the acceleration and the slowdown as manoeuvres at the disposal of the car mini robot 
The BR23C uses batteries Lithium polymère which are lighter and whose concentrated energy is greatest, which makes their lifetime longer than in the Lithium-ion version. 
According to Andoh is the intelligent instinctive reaction which is essential, not the data processing, and even less the ability to store. 
This mechanism must treat that some signals entrants per second, and respond to them. 
It is not necessary to store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. De this way, it only uses a few dozen kilo - octets of memory continues. 
It does not need memory of a capacity of gigabits, or even mega - octets. 
It is the first step towards the concept of a technology for the instant avoidance. according to the estimates of Nissan, this system will its entry in cars manufactured in number in the next ten years. 
One other application could be its incorporation into the GSP satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination avoiding obstacles in its path. 
It has even given a name to the baby unaffordable 
The written version of the rescue plan economic USD 700 billion, to buy the appropriations questionable banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
The first round, half of this amount will be spent. 
Reuters announces that during new debates go until after midnight, on Saturday, local time the east coast, the Congressional leaders are agreed on the existing controversies for days and days, around the rescue plan totalling USD 700 billion. 
"We have taken a major step forward " - said Nancy Pelosi should be invited, the chairperson democrat of the American Chamber of Representatives, according to which it only remains to implement the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from plan, is supported by the two candidates for the Presidency, Obama and John McCain. 
The Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will function and it will be effective, however other measures must be implemented. according to Pelosi should be invited, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the workings of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan has been made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20h, local time from Washington (namely on Monday 2 a. m. in the morning, according to the local time of Central Europe), but has not caused spectacular rise in the stock exchanges. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposal for a law responding on behalf of law economic stabilisation of urgency of 2008, and its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush has spoken to Pelosi should be invited, then the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied progress achieved this night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House. 
Furthermore, the programme differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the USD 700 billion should be spent at once, for the purchase of securities on dubious appropriations. 
Becomes maximum, half the sum of EUR 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. this first sum will be the Treasury Secretary to buy bad debts banks, while the use of extra USD 100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve take part too. 
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
According to the law, the secretariat of the Treasury can put in place a combined strategy: it can, at the same time, buy bad debts, securities on mortgages and mortgages dubious, and other types of claims toxic "". 
The competent people the Ministry declared that the takeovers can take place within the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule allows companies concerned, to take part in a programme of assurance, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools at the origin of concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damage. 
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to devote 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether the vast takeover of dubious claims, their insurance or to avoid the risk of seeing the system triggers the collapse of one or the other important financial institution. 
"We shall take the necessary measures, to be prepared to the application of the law, as soon as it will be signed " - he added. 
In contrast, the leaders of the banks in bad stances and waiting for state aid can expect their allowances, called simply golden parachute lands Atlantic, will be limited by the government. 
The capping of wages is mentioned only in the specific case. De more, restrictions depend on how the secretariat of the Treasury proposes its aid to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the secretariat of the Treasury repurchased within the framework of an auction, they take a surplus of tax on the golden parachute lands, unless President discredited bank based on retirement. 
Immediately after the purchase of the bad debts, the government will aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders should not be exaggerated. 
So that the image is complete, we must also add that the existing sweetening parachutes are not changed. The capping only concerns the new contracts, this to motivate and participation in the plan. 
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force concerning the allowances of the Directors-General - has commented on the chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the democrat Barney Frank. 
Moreover, the State provides a right of acquisition of shares in the banks taking part in the plan. De this way, the risk of taxpayers falls, they can even be winners in the matter as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will rebound upon their legs. 
The draft law mentions that within five years, the President must introduce to Congress, a proposal which will decide on how the losses will be returned to the taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
Two sides, there were obviously those who have expressed doubts about this plan. 
This is not why US citizens we have commissioned, this does not protect the taxpayers - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa. 
His colleague democrat Ohio, Mary Kaptur think it is the same who pull measures, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Obama and McCain support both the rescue plan banks 
On Sunday, Obama like John McCain, nominations for the presidency of the two major parties in America, have given their support the government's rescue plan USD 700 billion. but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Secretary. 
After marathon negotiations which have lasted days and days, the representatives in Congress and the administration have finally announced, Sunday at the beginning, that they have concluded agreements in principle on the rescue plan banks. 
This financing plan, aimed at the unfreezing of the crisis of Wall Street and credit market paralysed, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are even, everyone as more capable than the other, to lead the country outside the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a bit ahead. The advance McCain, achieved with the appointment of Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, has melted away. 
When a campaign meeting held in Strait, Sunday, Obama expressed its hope that Congress vote quickly the law on the rescue plan for 700 billion.

The press cuttings, the German language area 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - as mentioned Der Spiegel, the poor performance of the Bavarian CSU in the country. 
Haider is prepared to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and blacks. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel. of e) 
In publishing the news magazine German left-wing, Franz Walter analysing the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers '. 
According to this political scientist recognised, the erosion of CSU started before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo takes office. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these same citizens modern their turning back. 
This change of time is at the same time the problem of any Christian democracy, and also that of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, happened to end a process that was likely there is this, just ten years: the indisputable hegemony of national party was completed. 
It is ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU is collect with 47,7 per cent, and this for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50%. 
This has been repeated three years in the Bundestag elections of 2005, when so mentioned Stoiber. 
The question can be attributed to the modernisation " devouring its parents ', implementation in the region of consistent way by the CSU. 
This fact 40 years that sociologists announcing it but they have been deceived regarding the speed. but the secularisation, the results of education and the establishment of German North and is in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the accuracy of voters CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, only inside the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more obstinate. 
It is also surprising that over recent weeks, this is precisely the classic groups of citizens who are rather far away from CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, holders of the box and graduates of studies higher. 
In these groups, supporting the CSU has fallen below 40%. 
Die Press (diepresse. com) 
In his article entitled "Who? with whom? The party chairman lie on the reserve when faced with questions of the coalition", the conservative Austrian newspaper is dealing with the situation of the internal political confusion has arisen after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialists of the Austrian SDP wish to discuss with the conservatives in the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the Austrian SDP to interfere in its domestic affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiation. the Greens do not want yet to agree on the coalition. 
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the talkshows held public television, the party leaders have barely suggesting their cards. 
Werner Faymann, President of the Austrian SDP, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The Austrian SDP wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is indeed possible - it is what already exists in certain regions and in the Socialist partnership. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current president of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Molter reacted with caution to the proposals of red. 
As he has already said, cooperation will certainly unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry in the coalition is not a matter entirely open. these points must absolutely be debated within the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, new open to all proposals. 
"To avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are prepared to shoulder the responsibilities of government '- said Haider. 
Járóka said: we must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, began in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, whose guest is France, as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation in the plenary, as one of the main mouthpieces consultation experts, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, has drawn attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the right which affects most Roma children and this fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for work, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those who are invited to take part in the consultation, we find the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of legal protection and bodies European civilians, in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Group of the People's Party Member Fidesz, Járóka warned that alongside distinctions observed during the recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their low qualifications. 
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma have no secondary diplomas, and in consequence of basic education of poor quality, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a qualification outstripped ". 
Furthermore, Járóka has insisted on the fact that education as basic right of human beings plays a key role when we must assert the other fundamental rights. 
The investment in education early Roma children means a strengthening of the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to realise these reports in the widest possible, also between the Roma and the can. 
As soon as possible a Roma child begins school, more it increases its chances of becoming a member productive labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, it contributes to the budget of the state. 
" De by their nationality of the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from low quality education and sectarian. " - stressed Lívia Járóka. 
According to the honourable Member, cooperation between the European Union geared towards an objective and action is necessary for an acceleration of the process of desegregation schools. For this, respect for existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance. 
"It need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. it must give the possibilities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe " - demanded Járóka. 
On behalf of the European Year for the equal chance " guaranteed for all, the objective of the Summit for equality of opportunity in Europe organised every year since the summit last year in Berlin, is to ensure a unique platform for support measures in favour of equal opportunities and for the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and within the Member States. 
CSU: the thanks for a period of transition 
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein toppled duo 
Despite this electoral pitiful failure, heads are not yet fallen, and the debate on the personal questions at summits of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of government regional, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is: when will until the thanks? 
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a loss of voice catastrophic 17%, will be on the agenda of the party congress exceptional, held the last weekend in October. 
The members of this pair very criticised have, in any case, felt that they did not particularly to their seats. 
Thanks to this, they are employed to appease the members furious about the fraction and the basis, which one day after the Bavarian tsunami " demanded of personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
It is five years - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - socio Christian union - winning 60.7%, whereas today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4% of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been " sovereign single " of Bavaria giving 18 per cent of GDP German. 
But, the conservatives are always strongly in this region in the south, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. A future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of a internal readjustment of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which is currently initiating discussions to tone with the Liberals FDP, as well as with the Electeurs free, trained along the values of the Right, about a possible government coalition in Munich. 
A mockery strange the fate has been that aid from the list of Electeurs Libres, between in legislation Pauli Gabriele, whose taken measures against Stroiber has served possibility of coup carried out by the Huber-Beckstein duo, for then treat bluntly the very ambitious municipal politician. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all its energies to stabilise, in one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which up to now lay the behind the scenes, also receive an active role. the former head of the regional government and former President of the CSU, has appointed the 28 September as the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber launched a few incisive observations to the CDU. according to him, they would have deserved more support from the sister party. 
Others CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel cannot be Chancellor that if they put up in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played an important role in the national success. 
According to Merkel, concealing hardly its disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU will not adversely the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What is on because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of socialists always. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - its rivals 110 - 0: 
No member of the opposition came to Belarus parliament after the elections of Sunday. 
According to the Russian monitors, this is due to a country governed by Alexander Lukashenko, who assure him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to the illegalities committed during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in that country of 10 million inhabitants happens very many opposition for many decades, before the elections yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of Démocratiques Forces UN) (ODSZ seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of President for the fourth time at Elections, on the traces of the modification of the constitution in 2006, would " this time the presence of a few members of the opposition in parliament. 
And in this way, the ODSZ has relinquished its boycotting originally. 
The fact that Belarus, dependent economically increasingly Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, where because of the political order of Belarus described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entrance visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has take credit because of the reduction of imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and has thus contributed to the changeover from society, the owner of Beltransgaz dishonest gas across the country, is past in the hands of Russia. 
The fact that the OSCE, the evaluation of the campaign, emphasised the positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on run for a third of the opposition candidate, referred to a prior appeasement. 
But the communiqué of the OSCE on Monday already challenging the campaign, during which the bulk of the candidates for the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition is nevertheless a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is prepared to small confrontation with Moscow, always in refusing to recognise the South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated from Georgia. but Russia with which Belarus form a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories since already a month. 
"We have done two steps forward and one step back, but the most important is that dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU " - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
Judging by the candidate for the opposition of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that it remains so, despite that "power was afraid in this Parliament which has no weight, to bring even one opponent ". 
The opposition does not provide for actions of protests in view of the results. it tries rather to get his message on the need for economic reforms to the voters. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns in this area: we must make our newspapers print opponents in Russia, the local authorities we put a spanner in the works as regards broadcasting, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main outcome, the layer of pensioners most supported officially no longer regard it really as appropriate. 
" A cause of the debt of the countries and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'évoquant silence of a graveyard, is no longer a question of time" - believes Milinkevich. 
Contrary to the opposition politician, the Russian observers have described the democratic elections. 
Serguei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the press agency Russian Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words but in deeds. ". De this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: " A from today, before the work breakfast ". 
Report in the history of the Palais Chigi, not had revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from today, is in force this new measure against small clever, against which advanced and will then drinking coffee in the bar during working hours. 
The novelty anti lazy has been presented today by the Minister of the Publique administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi. 
"The revolving doors - tells Brunetta- are an instrument for work better, with more productivity, more and more services attendance specifies the Minister. 
Now beginning a new era of responsibility and transparency. 
"It is the " stresses reformism furthermore Brunetta. 
The installation of all of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Palais Chigi. 
According to Masi, " the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view. 
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, guarantees the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by workers, and we have had the cooperation of all ". 
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or increasing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests in smiling, " a good cappuccino to 7h the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution ". 
At a conference in the School higher public administration 
In Rome, the Minister communicates " in three months, the absence of disease of public employees are reduced by 50%, 60milles workers in a year". 
And it would add that it is essential to make it more efficient, the public administration. 
An Italian, "whose wage dynamic - explains the Minister - these 8 - 10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, are united to contest the standards of the decree Brunetta making use of the Codacons. 
" while the Minister of Public Administration run today data on the reduction of absenteeism on the workplace due to illness - writing the Consumers' Association - the people of the " lazy active " continues to increase. 
In fact, in Italy, thousands of employees of the public administration correct and productive, met to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, the Tar, we dispute the exclusion of additional benefits in the event of injury due to service; the extension of the working hours of hours of permanence worker authority ill, during which are carried out inspections, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions advocated by the Minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: " Prevention crucial " 
Every day, in Italy, there are 500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who are disabled permanently. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm, that the white deaths have been around 1 200. 
Figures, which demonstrate the seriousness of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and almost twice more deaths than the murder. 
Having the attention of the institutions, of social forces and ways of information on this dramatic, the Anmil famous today in all the Italian provinces, the 58ème national Day for victims of accidents on labour, institutionalised the second Sunday in October. 
"The worrying information provided by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the issue of prevention in the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, at a message to the President of the National Association Anmil, mutilated and disabled labour Mercandelli Pietro. 
The head of state expresses its " sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort associations in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of workers injured, assistance to the victims' families and public awareness " 
"naturally outraged, everyone has struck the fist to put an end to such tragedies which, by their dimension, create the cries of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the everyday reality we present dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano cannot deny that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is ECU to invest in training and information " 
The many initiatives promoted in the education sector, bear a particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people who enter the world of work. 
It is our duty, maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not under assess the alarm on the seriousness social, apply and improve legislative standards. 
De its part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed on how this phenomenon of " white deaths is an absolute social urgency, which insults the conscience of all of us, and imposes on all the institutions, to make a real effort to terminate it quickly." 
Data on the work of accident seem to point out a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of deaths is white when even impressive " stressed the chairman of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
We do not want this " cut-price trend " is in fact a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention is acquittal that comes the tragedy. 
We believe that in general, it is not enough to block the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through many actions ". 
" In facility has stressed Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as a more important on the training of workers, and this in school ". 
- It has added - "we must also make an effort with regard to the communication and public awareness. 
" but we must above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon which represents an emergency social ". 
" Mercandelli subsequently denounced the gradual deterioration of conditions to safeguard the planned compensation for the victims of work " and " assistance drift towards which the system is moving in recent years. 
"The aim therefore, is to restore the worker insurance guarantee - he said - so that the fate of someone who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or enlargement of the legislator " 
Mp3 reader pointing the finger, they put at risk the hearing. 
Ecouter music to full volume for a prolonged period using portable musical appliances such as the readers Mp3, can cause permanent damage to hearing. 
That is precisely what the European Commission, which, in a statement circulated in Brussels, quote the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the health risks unplanned and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
" scientific report - we read in the note - it is that 5 - 10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to music to full volume using portable musical appliances, for over an hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing the capacity ". 
" I am concerned about the fact that so many young people who use frequently musical appliances mobile telephones and mobile full volume, can damage unconsciously their hearing so irreparable " says Meglena Kuneva. 
" In the scientific data - pursues the responsible Ue - it is a clear risk and we must respond quickly. 
What matters is more awareness of consumers and make these information of public domain. 
We must re-examine in addition, the existing control systems given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels asked the Scientific independent, to examine the problem, given the intensive use of mobile musical appliances and the increase in the number of young people who are exposed to noise that they cause. 
"The scientists - concluded the executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will examine now with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could perhaps be adopted in order to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from aircraft mobile music and similar equipment. 
There is already a European standard of safety which limits the level of noise mobile musical 100Db, but the concern is growing hearing about the harm which could derived from excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit these data making use solutions such as the reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise. 
The Scientific Ue remarked that users of mobile musical appliances, who are listening to music to full volume (more 89 decibels) for five hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force on the level of noise maximum made in the workplace. 
Those who are listening music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk of a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years. 
Which interested 5 - 10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU. E. 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we are starting, in March we end in June we learn the are. 
That is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the " Commission for the future of Rome Capital ', which took place this morning, the new seat, behind the spas of Caracalla. 
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other components of the Commission will point the directives to Rome. 
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the City Council will assess the analyses and projects, presented in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the official stamp " " on Capitol Hill and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
" The Committee is totally independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented - wishes to stress Alemanno - it must propose ideas of development of Rome which can use the political decision-making, which remain the Committee and the City Council. 
No overlapping roles, but only the desire for a corner where a great project for Rome. 
In March, it completes its tasks and disappear then, because this experience must have a period of time. 
In June - the mayor - we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital ". 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno reply: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as indeed in Rome, I am on, its contribution will be essential. 
Too often politics is beset by the management of everyday life and emergencies which occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see the before, and further, towards a forward-looking deeper, working seriously development of Rome and its future ". 
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that the Commission is not a body or a whole unnecessary bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost another euro to Roman city-dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best minds which express the Capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, there is a draft strategic reference or firm or changing to enable our city, to improve, what it has absolutely need, while sparing a thought for its future now a spirit unitary, ". 
A future which specifies the Mayor of Rome, " will not be limited to the usual local borders, but which will further " not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also by the role that Rome can and must be, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean '. 
Obama? The first president anti-American. why. 
A famous American politician who wishes to move for independent, wrote: " Obama will be the second President anti-American. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, which, in its decisions, destroyed the US economy and were reports (as it has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam ". 
The attacks against Obama increase while the date of the elections are approaching. 
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: " this person is full of ambition ". 
Obama really is rich: he believes he gain the highest office of a nation which account in any, two governors and five senators black "! 
In reality, it is attacks which do not say much; this are obviously attacks racial nature, and do not respond to the question of all voters: it will be a good President?, furthermore, we have the polls, which all say that Obama gain and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
A Mississipi newspaper in the sandpits of the south of the US, wrote an article: once in the cab of vote, we know that the American patriot will give its vote. 
That emerges is one aspect of the American mindset kept secret until the end. 
"Tell what you want, we see we even put the cross, on Obama or on McCain. 
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we leave the United States. 
Thing ever proved until now, so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these arguments, the card winner for democrats is George Bush. 
We asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89% replied: Iraq. 
America exchange. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was returned home to the fesses. 
In Iraq, 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make suitcases. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will an enormous damage to accomplish. 
Use, the economic debacle felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time the deletions. and many accuse Internet, this " murders " paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been arrested by the PEW Research Centre on the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
And well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future. 
But they have not said openly to the attached information, feel less concerned about the credibility. 
They did not feel isolated as previously. 
The problem of American journalists, is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition, the deletions carried out in the newsroom in the Chamber where editors work in the assembly of newspapers, are a major problem. 
It is a problem which must be resolved, according to journalists interviewed, if we want the traditional journalism as the general public, will be reduced consistently. 
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalism. 
Six on ten elderly executive and journalists of newspapers printing are convinced that journalism at national level is pursuing a bad way. 
Locally, the executive group is to 65%. 
Communication printed against broadcast. 
The journalists have not difficult to see where is the Web. 
The greatest houses publisher their transition to Internet perceived by many as " the murderer " paper newspaper. 
The " economic pressure " that feel journalists is increased until 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to technology hoping that it " do something good " for their journalism. 
Today, the hitch the greatest in the American journalism lies between who run the newsrooms - managers - and reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, whereas at local level, this percentage descends to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the "safety of work '. 
The managers who think losing their job in the area of 3 years, are 47% at national level. 
In regard to journalists, we are going to 30%. 
Of course, work " "at the level (our staff editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists work under contract. 
In a nation immense as the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often provide what they want, and it becomes a quick question to take or leave it. 
Prison receive nearly always major wages, while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, in addition to the retirement age and the payment of insurance. 
While the holidays, the logic is complicated: x days after the first year n days after the third, until 15 days at all, past a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations American journalists, are often "diseased " during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
UNIPOL: T RIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA. 
The President of the second section criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the body of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave the city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the framework of education on the escalation Unipol - Bnl. 
During the trial in its burden, last week, he had obtained the release into compulsory residence authority to Grottaferrata. 
Its lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had requested that the estate agent can go the route of the provincial town to a home in the capital. 
According to the tribunal, such movements (the token has not granted) would still to influence its society and have access to the evidence that the blame. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon has already shown a few days, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan for USD 700 billion approved by the White House: a good significant number of American was, and is still, more interested to punish Wall Street that to save the US economy. 
And it is the New York Times yesterday we communicating confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican, even more divided between its eve soul East Coast, moderate favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to " those of Washington " and the world of finance, powerful, especially in the States of Central and South. 
The soul, precisely, who has made feel governing with the vote which I spoke at the beginning. 
But what has just been mentioned is just one example changes, of great changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or leaves already run: not only the United States, but in the whole of the West, and can be not only here. 
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena smoulder for some time, so that, in the new climate, they consolidate and are. 
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, double category - sovereign state, compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking institutions - financial, obviously narrow reports with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance of people and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This creates an immediate political problem for which governs: that is to say as meet the difficulties and to the protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economically but politically, it is almost that national here. 
The internationalization policy seems really off-side or has not great thing to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, will not decide no common political line. 
And so it is the government of each state that all await interventions, plans to rescue and relaunch, new rules, and especially a affection appropriations: when you travel through a difficult period, there is that states who possess the economic resources, the volume of financial resources able to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use resources: two invaluable, elements which no market or international organisation can never have similar way. 
This new emphasis of the crisis - nation state is in perfect harmony with the importance always major economic developments more recent the economy tend to give a factor quite linked to this element: the territoriality. 
. paradoxically, indeed, whereas we were persuaded to now be entered in the realm of the network, technology increasingly sophisticated, of not equipment, convinced that the globalised finance was now intended to dominate the world, we went account of one, that our future must instead settle its accounts increasingly with things somewhat material such as water, harvest, oil. 
Where things that can certainly be transported from one place to another, but which are absolute way to a limited area, a territory. 
For example, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards that anyone who is not, in other words, whoever has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I now come to the second innovation, however provides a fracture. 
Who said territory, state, Government said, inevitably, policy and therefore Leadership. 
Here the economic crisis seems produce two phenomena convergent. 
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who know take control of the situation. 
And on the other hand, a wave of disrepute leadership for the existing economic species which have proven to be inadequate and full of grey area. 
And furthermore, something even deeper, in a sense, even worrying: a shadow, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness which seeks to involve the whole class managers in an increasing number of country of the West. 
So increases even more convinced of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their climax, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the word, to have the same time, and to be still more foreign to the opinions of majorities. 
In short, The request leadership feeds of surface, a powerful and ramifié movement of délégitimassions ruling classes and orders traditional policies, which manifests itself in the " revolts electoral " impromptu or, in the changes of collective mood of recent very recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, the fall of Labour in Great Britain, the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the Right in Italy is not arrived by chance). 
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectuals accredited, their format, seems someone, have always more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the profound strata of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and wave of potentially. 
In the view of all this, to speak of a current rebellion masses on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But it is said, keep our eyes wide open, this is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Entitled the laws of the seriousness with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls as Spiderman. 
That is the objective of various research centres, and today a team institutes of four almost succeeds.

The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those that we know which use a particular structure of carbon, called nano tubes carbon. 
"The principle glue can be devised as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti. " explain Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have inspired leg disorders of geckos, covered of microscopic kinds which allow assure the animal, a perfect adhering. 
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the glass, the Téflon and paper of glass, have shown that the new removed is ten times more powerful than the legs these reptiles, and at the same time, that it stands out easily the walls " explains Liming Dai, researcher engineering faculty of the University of Dayton. 
Walk SUR LES MURS? - " this material could be used as Liming Dai adds removed temporary". 
Can be to walk on the walls as Spiderman? Can be that yes, but researchers are thinking about a use much less attractive as the connection between electronic appliances, given that the nano tubes carbon drivers are heat and electricity. 
Others applications could affect the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, no super heroes. 
The AUTRE RECHERCHE- the University of Berkeley, California, it also bears in search of a new removed. 
In an article of the American periodical American Chemical Society, researchers Californian presented a removed formed of microfibres as hair, principally car of dust during the movement on an area to ensure a constant perfect and grip. 
Medicine: never with fruit juices. 
Beware of pamplemousse orange juice, and apple. 
These drinks, consumed mainly been because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital medicines, distort the absorbement popular or reducing depending on the circumstances, their effectiveness, with very serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, points out the risks of fruit juices that they are, in boite or costs, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236ème meeting national American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, it launches a new alarm: a glass of pamplemousse orange juice, and apples, to reduce the absorbement some vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The pamplemousse juice has already been strongly criticised because held responsible for increasing the effects of certain medicines anti arythmiques, antibiotics, tranquillizers, anti staminales and neurological, until toxic levels. 
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE- which is the Italian Agency the medicine itself, which gave the new in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients not under assess the danger of this mix and to pay attention to what we drink, if we take medicines such as, for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
PAS QUE the PAMPLEMOUSSE- according to the experts, even the orange juice and bone contains substances that inhibit medicines. 
There is a long list of active principles inhibited by the pamplemousse and other juice. 
And hence, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of pharmacology department of the public University of Milan: " these findings are generally immediately reported the various national agencies and international medicines to the need, change the notes informative medicines. 
It must always read the papers indicative of medicines that one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but clearly address the doctor or a pharmacist " stressed the expert the Ansa agency. 
The Nobel economics Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Prize of the economy has been allocated to the United States Paul Krugman for his research models and trade on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a Keynesian néo - which the assume University and it is also a famous writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the greatest criticism solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more crucial that the first, in terms of impact on US history. 
A forecast who unleashed many polemics, and which was being the economist for years, but who now proved accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, have disappeared from the public's attention " had said Krugman at the end of 2002 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a " economist of great value, but also a divulgateur style " very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, this is the third edition of the anti package - Microsoft " 
It is the day of the dissemination of OpenOffice. where rg.3.0, following open source of personal productivity which aims to reach still more users, the home to the Bureau, professionals to the public administration, proposing an alternative free the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost a year, achieved by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new package Open Office is the general public with various innovations: the display of welcome, and the interface reviewed and become less dry, to other more important, as the compatibility born to the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open document Format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office has particular attention to the interaction with the following Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (. of ocx. x lsx. p ptx). 
So interesting, certain specific function to some modules as that which enables us to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by email, or to import queue PDF in the module of drafting a diagram, maintaining the original aspect of page. 
Still on this front, it is possible to create documents " PDF hybrid " which unite the graph typical of the Adobe format the elements of a roadmap calculation or a winemaker text. 
The cooperation between several people is an element which has had various improvements within the applications: in the Road calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes in the draft texts, because each employee is attributed colour of comments for greater recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are even working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should make the final outcome. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / /it. where penoffice. where rg/download/3.0.0/download300. p. tmlet and adds to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available in addition, for the opératif Linux system. 
On request, the cd of installation can be shipped at home or in the workplace. 
And if the subject of non-remuneration can be a way to disseminate in houses, it is precisely in the business, that following Open Office is the great challenge, can count on various projects in public administration and schools. 
Without count the realities which offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to the vanguard of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer for video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the Road calculation, which aims to replace spreadsheet; Impress, for the presentations rival of PowerPoint; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the programme which allows us to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the module chart. 
Objective for 2008, reach 5 million download, and recital that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, it may even exceed the figure planned 
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping. 
New case overall positive tone at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, described third, and winner of the jersey the best climber. 
It is the site of the Equipe daily which the new. 
A 26ans Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera, the Epo third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, too Gerolsteiner. 
The blood tests carried out on test tubes Kohl belong to those carried out in recent weeks, by laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the overall positive tone in Cera, Austrian will lose its third place the Tower and must forcement expect two years of disposal. 
The news of the overall positive tone Kohl to the Epo third generation, has been confirmed by the leader of the French agency anti doping, Pierre Bordry, which gave the Associated Press, have notified the overall positive tone to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans has placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and the United States Cadel Evans, wins the jersey in peas the best climber. 
Immigrate: N EW YORK TIMES SE DEMANDE SI The ITALIE TSEs RACISTE? 
Italy " as emigrants Country has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants " met with resistance. 
This would transform the Beau countries in a nation of racist? and what to intéroge the New York Times which has dedicated a long Article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, on the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for having stolen a boite of biscuits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the " paradox of north ": the Nordic regions are both those where " more integration and more work ", but also a anti-immigration feeling the strongest and most important support for the Lega Nord " 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislature desired by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is quoted as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: " Giorgio Napolitano at its meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked what the state and church work together to defeat racism ". 
Etudiants victims rents ladies, up to EUR 900 for a chamber. 
The market try for students is no crisis 
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, hire a chamber simple can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached very seriously point to exclude whole categories of young people, the right to study because of the total costs very high that families of origin must support - explains the responsible for the office of studies of Sunia Laura Mariani- in those cities, strong demand on the part of students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has amorcémême for residents. 
In most cases, the tender rent contain a series of violations: contracts of type free, not registered, without any limit of rent, subleasing. 
For the Sunia, exceptional measures through the review of taxation, are needed to alleviate prices. 
Lisant in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the area Brianza, it must approximately EUR 450; for a simple chamber, we will EUR 650 minimum (Gang zone Nere), an average of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of EUR 900 (Vittoria zone) 
A Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a chamber approximately EUR 700. 
A Bologna, where students focus in the areas close to the University, it must 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a chamber simple. 
A Rome, in the regions close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) calls approximately EUR 600 for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Italia dei Valori slightly lower (550 euro for one simple) for the regions close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We cannot save that if people living in those areas périphériques:300 euro for a bed, and 450 for one simple in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
A Naples for a bed it must 300/400 euros, in a simple is spent 400 to 600 euros, with prices highest in those areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Aminei Colli. 
A Bari to read, it must count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In cities more small, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the economy cities. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which the hire are often taken by non-Community students, there are a further anomaly: the rent asked the foreign students is plus 25/30% compared to that applied to the Italians. 
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities éliment historical rooms. 
The rooms historical cinema closing in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without rooms of cinema is a city blind, it is as a face without eyes " 
The image offered by the orchestrator Giuseppe Tornatore, exemplifies what happens in the major urban centres Italian, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of big multisalles, and the death of consomption of mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the major events which we believe is inescapable and undeniable; it has increasingly all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
A disappear, are often places historical and responsible for memory, " it is as if one of my friends, disappeared, someone known, with which we have shared a way and so much commotion " observes the orchestrator of Nuovo cinema film Paradiso, which offers Tornatore there 20 years, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix the sworn in Cannes and telling poetry a chamber of province, and the nostalgia for a way of life the cinema, lost can be forever. 
The figures provided by Anec, the main association traders, simply want to say: these last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and these are the main rooms towns which have paid the price: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 Palermo. 
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emily Romaine is in mind with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The proof that confirms tonnes that primary responsibility for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because these are the three Italian regions that have the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens in Lombardy these last five years, 81 in Tuscany as Emilia-Romagna. 
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrational way " observes Paolo Protti, chairman of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we do need to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room firm in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to multiplex. 
Not to mention the missed deliberation of credit for traders: debt antécédente of the state of approximately EUR 10 million. 
It is shameful that étique and moral point of view, the government does not respect existing laws. 
For supporting the sector, it should between 16 and 18 million per year. 
References to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, concerned by these closures, decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms historical centres and periphery. 
Among the prescriptive planned, there are measures of tax facilities in favour of the managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators can enter the area to movement limited, and have special tariffs for the parking spaces and in some car-park attendants. 
"It is an initiative which I very fond " observes Giuseppe Tornatore " and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures. 
It is nonetheless clear that, in contrast the super power of multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of its and the image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is an issue which for me, has always been important: the closure of Supercinema of Bagheria, my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has convinced me to "New cinema Paradiso " which I thought already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome since 25 years, and when I turn to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have both experienced shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see signs blacken by the dust. 
Link between politics and the ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardise the choice of the mayoralty the interests of Piromalli clan ". 
Serious accusations are launched by the magistrates of the anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, towards the Mayor and vice Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli's Liberal Socialists, arrested this morning to external competitions for mafia association. 
The manettes also for Gioacchino Piromalli, former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and its small son lawyer, Nice the bosses, already condemned for criminal association of mafia type and pay 10 million. 
" an insult to the prescriptive legal and moral, and especially the good sense " write prosecutors, both local administrations had expressed the desire to pay consultations to Maître Piromalli. 
" so that people would have been granted in the clan - write judges - to enter officially within the councils facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientement public administration " 
The chairman of the Committee Calabrian criminals regional Agazio Loiero, cannot deny that " collusion between the local committees and organised crime, there are more than a" in its region: there are places where the intensity mafia is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there are also many politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests of this morning follow those last July, following which the police announced have decapitate the Piromalli clan. 
So the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of alleged rigidity between organised crime and the local authorities, local politicians were released from their duties to administer the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the People when the dissolution had been appointed head of a coalition of centre right, after the run-off May 2006 
It shouted the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
It accuse the vice Interior Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of having engineer all this to a political issue, but given the request of incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even manages to ask the variation in the draft the A3. 
Seen from interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write token, is emerge " the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a group more experienced, close to the Piromalli, harmonising the choice of public administration to the interests of clan. 
When energy is born waves, now the big embark. 
This is a disproportionate source which is more than 70% of the surface area of the planet and now the big companies worldwide energy are currently discover. 
Wave, currents, tides, that is the new sources on which behemoths as Chevron have asked me, and now trying to get their hands. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea is studied since now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in competition with the first oil crisis, research intensified. 
When the price of oil, declined to 1980, the idea to exploit marine energy was sidelined, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase oil give a great boost to the sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London ruled in 2007, that 15% of global need electricity could be covered by operating systems of the houle seas. 
This amount would be double that produce nuclear power stations. 
And in addition, there is the currents and the marées.. 
Colossus attack. 
The first to rely on the marine energy has been the Enersis, which in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in the north of Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a real step revolutionary. 
A two years ago, always more applicants among these enterprises doomed since always to traditional energy rely on the marine energy. 
" Chevron is currently examining the technologies on energy océanique - said the spokesman for a company associated with American oil colossus, daily Wall Street economic Journal- and evaluates the possibilities to cooperate with us". 
The cooperation in question concerns a permit deliberated by the American committee for energy, necessary to give rise to a project of exploitation of energy Marine in Alaska. 
This is a very important sign, especially if you consider that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there has Verdant Power Inc. De New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, wandering the way energy from the sea, and the sums invested until today, although their details are known, indicate according to the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to point. 
The experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, from the fact that the marine energy dispelling fears about the environmental impact. 
A present systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create major problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce the large-scale energy, however, we must use of technology with a higher environmental impact. 
"And the choices are various: Ocean Power, for example, using a system of buoys linked to each other. 
The surge of vague, that is wagging the sludge upwards and the low is converted into water pressure of pistons and its cylinders, within the cork. 
The pressure runs a turbine which, in turn, leads to a generator. 
Energy is sent to the shore through cables under sailors. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in a phase of project, in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of energy could serve to a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing energy to a commercial centre and a car park using six turbines marine under the East River of New York. 
The movement of water in the tides, runs the turbines pales of, creating a movement which feeds a rotational income. 
Verdant announced a long list of customers awaiting the necessary authorizations to poach energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for research electricity, deserves at the moment, the potential of tides. 
Although this is a intermittent phenomenon, the oil is more predictable wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely on energy tides that states as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, to look at the coastline, have invested seven and a half million dollars in 2008 and provides for investment until 35 million in 2009
