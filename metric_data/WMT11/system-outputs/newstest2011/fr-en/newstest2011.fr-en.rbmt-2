What it will happen? CSSD not connait or Voldemort or of pastry to Prague.
The new elected officials of CSSD to the city hall of the capital apparently will have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand itself at the level of the town council with their old and new collegues of the ODS.
The Newspaper Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the belonging town council to CSSD, to knowledge if they know the argôt that was born during the last years to the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that directed to Prague.
The encoded vocabulary that the cream politics of Prague put in road during the preceding era of the mayor Pavel Bem describes some one of the personalities, positions, and cause metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials do not understand trés well the known terms.
Less the they say.
"That is Valdemort."
"I do not know really."
"I am a jeunôt in the political pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected official to the culture to the test of the vocabulary of the" godfather."
And for what concerns the political veteran, the elected official Karel Brezina reacted same manner.
For example feels it of "golf hole."
"It is the only expression among the one that you propose me that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Vocabulary, of which the Newspaper Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the congrés of the ODS, the compilation chose 6 examples, in priority those that are secured with the city hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the direction of "Voldemort," "the biggest hole of golf to Prague," go to the patisserie," "beef nerve," "treason of the capital" and "con."
Three of the elected officials were in agreement for the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, that must direct the education to Prague in the future - promised first of all a discussion but next did not unhook the telephone.
The fifth elected official Petr Dolinek straight refused the test.
"I not at all take care any those things and how have fun themselves the representatives of the democracy citizen: I will not give my opinion."
"I take care currently manner of which we will understand ourselves in the framework of our programs," has t it reacted.
As one already heard it, the elected official Lukas Kaucky would recognize not apparently in the legend above, that it is a matter of the influential Janousek on the contractors and friends of the former Roman mayor Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing á'Kaucky and the only expression that it guessed in the test is "the biggest hole of golf to Prague."
"It is a matter of the tunnel Blanka" says Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know it newspapers."
"I will have to pay myself a language course," pleasing t it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy,l'élu for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know that is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy known the place where to find the personage - it thinks about the direction of "to go to the pastry."
"It is a matter, I think, to go in a business," Plachy is ready to guess that it is a matter of the seat of the corporations of Janousek.
On the even your Brezina recalls that it pulls its knowledge rather of the newspapers and not of any vocabulary that it would use.
According to the candidates to the tests it does not exist any glossary of argôt in the social democracy.
"I took counsel with colleagues and it appears that we do not have really something of this type."
"One is said rather the names some time one uses abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the social Party democrat, that the members of the Party call Hulda.
"One called me Briza to the school but I do not know if my colleagues call me as that, had Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The Newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and that walks.
The elected official Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or well the less friendly old Small, the representative Miroslav Pocket, that attracted the attention on him before the elections by the swindles during the sponsoring on the part, is nicknamed "the small toy."
The nicknames are also the only ones as admit to employ inside the party the social democrats.
It appears that Hulinsky likes not a lot to hear Hulda, but the Newspaper Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this president pragois.
"Doctor in baton right" recalls it appears that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctor title in right JUDr.à the academy of police of bratislava.
The government wants to diminish the tortures of the "witches," edited a pamphlet.
To the Burkina Faso, the declared women witches have common traits.
They do left rather of the old generation, cannot work for example for reasons of health, are free and do not have any child.
The one that becomes "witch" is isolated in order not to to threaten the remainder of the town.
"The man has very rarely this destiny."
"One does not judge not more the young women in good health for they participate in the work and deliver children," declares a sister that takes care in the capital of this country of western Africa, the Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women that were rejected by the corporation.
The local government decided to intervene against this "social measure" unusual.
It edited a pamphlet that should help has to limit the hunt to the witches.
The matter consisting of a "snag."
"More than 70 percent of the adults to the Burkina Faso does not know to read," warned the Newspaper Says Standard about the inconvenience of the written education.
The sorcery accusation is current in of other countries of Africa.
To the Ghana, neighbor of the Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years deceased after torturing by three women and a man then burnt with oil that they had splashed him.
It is the waiter of the BBC that transmitted this information.
The criminals assert that it was a matter of the bad eye.
According to their version oils it that serves to ritual anointments is themselves emflammée to the contact of the woman.
The oil singed, it adorned, when the team wanted "to hunt the bad spirit" woman.
The insulation of the "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The Newspaper Der Standard quoted a contractor of 42 years of the Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human spirits always represented a danger," says it.
While the Burkina Faso strives to reduce the hunt to the witches, the Gambie not later than last year even saw the President himself there to participate.
"The President gambien Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt to the witches that, it adorned, would have participated in his death and would have striven by the black magic to kill equally the President."
"Chamans of Guineas close come to the rescousse, brought to the presidential farm to Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and personal guard of the President, men and women choose at random dansdes towns of Gambie," indicated in a message the organization "International Amnesty.
To the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a potion to plant basis to the hallucinogenic effects that provoked what's more other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners did not there survive.
On the international pressure it is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The poèles heat, it signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man took out by the door of the center clientele of the corporation RPG Byty of the "baron of coal" Zdenek Bakal, the biggest private owner of apartments to rent in Czech Republic.
It carried under the arm a file with three new contracts of housing for three apartments: his, the one of his girl and of his son that is liveliness to purge a penalty.
The dérégulation did to increase the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to regulate from next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is not hot water and the heating works to the solid combustible," shows finger on the new contract of his son the man that has the signature strength.
"But I signed nonetheless" explains t it to motié in anger and to resigned half.
The association citizen of the apartments BytyOKD.cz that described the nouelles conditions of housing as "immoral and indecent," counsels to the not tenants to sign and await until December 7, dates to which will be published a notice to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts thereto by a gesture of the hand.
"The one says that, the said other something else" while gathering the eyebrows.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of the dérégulation.
After the New Year is what awaits most of the apartments in Czech Republic of which the rents do not correspond to the price of the market.
Aktualne.cz has for this reason decided to visit personally the "laboratory."
The room of expectation of RPG in the street Havirovska is the one of the four of the region of Ostrava and she already is full on Tuesdays at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Just next to the door is held a guard of a corporation of security with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lit on the tactile screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number goes out of the device.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your number already begins if illuminate on the big screen under the topit of the room of expectation.
In a second fraction this is your turn.
After a current instant,un old couple arrives to inform itself on the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the expectation room.
The majority of the people came to regulate current problems as everywhere - asks repairs, events concerning the assurances and other.
In the region of Ostrava, the people of more than 44000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG recoivent the mails with the new contracts of lease in their wood to the letters since about the mi-novembre.
RPG Byty proposes them increases of rent of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for the new rents is opened to the public since November 18.
"It works since near of a week, this is therefore again to the essay" replies, after a hesitation instant, the employee behind the window when the customer presents himself as journalist.
The déragulation and the former apartments of minors of Bakal are a local very sensitive subject.
The vice president of the parliament and native of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the social democrats did some in a manner rather sustained state before the elections and that fills henceforth the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They did not even change me a put. ..n of board in the wc, relieves itself in introduction the mentioned man.
Nevertheless, it is especially, according to the employees, retired that come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of the rent if they sign now as promised it RPG in a special offer.
It is a rebate of the half of the amount of the rent that will receive the other loctaires that will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the window "dérégulation" street Havirovaska really is not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers that came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," indicates the employee to the window.
And nevertheless RPG porpose so on his website that in the windows of individual discussions on the rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent court that will take the decision.
'It is not a matter no threats but only to inform on the unique and legitimate manner to act legally ," indicates RPG on his website.
"Here no one will go to the court" thinks the one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the clientele center gives him reason.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and it remains me 5000 crowns to eat, I have not enough to go to the court," says it.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the required media that no one signs and therefore the people await," indicates t she.
The regulation of the rents finishes in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economical necessity.
"And, of more, the current rents do not attain not yet the necessary level for simple discussion of the funds for the lodgings," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the corporation RPG Byty, that it is exactly the negligence of the funds for the lodgings that returns the tenant in anger is the principal reason of the increase of the rent.
Nevertheless in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with the rents to invest in the apartments 4 billions, in four years of 2011 has 2014 that should do 5,2 billions.
The big hung screen to the ceiling opposite the padded armchairs of the room of expectation of the street Havirosvka, repeats nevertheless some advisable information in red.
'The increase of the rent in 2011 is of 15 percent and concerns not less than 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments of RPG ."
"And this will always be to the more 7,50 Czech crowns the m² by months," indicates the screen.
The increase of 38 percent concerns only 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In that case, it is a matter of an increase of a really sum very low 19.66 Czech crowns to the m²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that the dérégulation will not provoke a radical but progressive increase 4 to 8 years.
She adds other engagements: all the money of the increase of the rents (cf. the graphe) is returned to the apartments under the form of economies of heating - new windows and heating.
Those that sign the agreement on the rent increase have the right of way.
The maternal done left school, she also, offices understood the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new seat of the corporation Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it shelters equally a mini school maternal with all that it is necessary - walls of colors, imaginative furnishings, toys and at last a land of miniature games on the terrace.
Since last year October, itself there can return the children of the employees of Arch. design.
The corporation of architectonic projects Arch. Design. of which the workshops produced a big number of constructions to Brno, imagined his mini school maternal of business since the first preliminary sketches of the building Avriopoint.
She employs about 90 people, especially age to have children and it imported him that the women architects and project bosses quickly can come back to the work.
At the same time that contracts of on time diminished work, the maternal school is a proposed bonus to its employees by the corporation Arch. Design. in the social framework of his program.
The builders and the architects have thus the possibility to ally a taking work with the care for the children.
It is employed them d'Arch.Design.eux-mêmes that imagined this maternal school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain an allocation of the European Union and Ministry of the work and social matters.
The mini school maternal is financed by the European social means of the Funds through the operational program of the human resources and Budget étatique of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to financing allocations (to height of 2,8 mil.de crown Czech). They were able to buy the equipments and devices and after two years to assure a qualified personnel as well as the placement in road.
After the usage of the allocation of financing (two years) the corporation Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to let the mini work school maternal on its funds own.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is the corporation Economy rating that helped to do the allocation request.
The care to the children is assured by a qualified personnel, all day long a nurse and a teacher of maternal one take care of the children. the children can go to the maternal school without age limitation but they have more than three anspour the most.
As it is a matter of a "mini school maternal" there can be only 5 present children at the same time, but during the course of the day there are some more that replace themselves.
The functioning of the school is supple according to the needs of the parents and the children of all the employees have the same right to use this school without look on the hierarchic position.
Although it been a matter of a care and an individual educations, the program of the mini school maternal is comparable to the one for the education préscolaire.
The children do not there do that to play but a quality teaching there also is assured - beginning until the preparation for the school benches one sign the English.
The class is equipped not only toys and imaginative games but equally of a computer that the children can use.
The presence of the small children in the corporation create a friendly and environment positive.
The parents are able to any moment to check their child and not to have stressed it of a delay to be going to look for the children in a removed school of the place of work of the parents.
The parents use therefore their time of work of the manner more productive.
It is not astonishing that creates itself a natural relation of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Thus registered Arch.Design.s'est among the corporations that offer a choice bonus for recruitment again employees and that are friendly towards the family and through this program reinforces the marketing of the RH.
The house in bone fascinates again after 100 years. Throw an eye in the interiors of Gaudi.
The toît resembles the prehistoric back of a saurien, the stairway to a vertebral column of dinosaur and the balconies to mouths of open fish.
This is as well as is the house Put Battlo to Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the local the nickname of House in bone.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual usage of rocks, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, facade reminding of the scales and everywhere present bends, here all that is ypique for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its colors and pleasant textures that recall the nature and the animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees geometry, the rhythm and the thought order with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit of such manner that the impression of shininess of the colors is reinforced some.
The enroulement and the torsion of the forms appears equally in the interiors with the same measure.
Wood copies in waves the frameworks of windows, the railings, the decorative elements of the doors, the peephole and the strips.
The house Battlo that stands up in the neighborhood Eixample in the street bargains over Passeig of Pardoned to the number. 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Salted Cortes.
The reconstruction was done for two years and the finished house in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich contractor, has first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another all new one but accepted quickly the idea of Gaudi of an unusual reconstruction and of better market.
But the idea of Put Battlo as house to multiple lodgings was not thought by only Gaudi.
The architect Josep Got married Jujol worked with him.
It is exactly on his project that were born the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the usage of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the facade equally worked other artists and creators.
The common work for the plans of the house Put Battlo began by a cooperation to succés between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Put Mila and park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The local ones nicknamed the house to hot immediately following his finishing because of its organic forms "the House in bone."
Of others, had consideration to the specific mechanism of opening of the windows called it "the house that bucket."
One says that at the top of the construction there is a similar sword to the one of Holy Georges the employer of the Catalonia.
Of other elements of sculpture of the construction contain religious hidden motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in his time of heating central,avec of the évents of ventilation and typical fireplaces.
Their incline of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi did not absolutely respect the directives of construction of then and did not leave itself to impede by them.
At first construction it obtained from the city it building permit, knowing, of course that the data reaches on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after during finishing the town council was horrified and asked modifications.
It did not please, for example, to the members of the town council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the public sidewalk.
It never had modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo required (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to rent the two higher floors.
The owner moved to the inferior floors.
In the gallery to the second floor there was a common parlor and to the third one a room and a private party of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire house of six floors is divided by a stairway by which one attains until a terrace of independent toît.
All the straight angles and the upright lines were canceled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by walls bend.
Gaudi worked equally the modern concept of liaison of the spaces.
The common party can be linked up completely while opening the doors of the parlors and the high corporation can communicate comfortably or well to limit itself the private space for more intimate discussions.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received besides of new facades a non traditional toîture and two floors what's more.
The game of Gaudi with the light is equally impressive, blue glassy tiles and white with which these is decorated the internal course and with the light wells.
The game to two colors gives a light maximum in all the floors of the house.
It sufficed simply to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than the dark one that on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Put Battlo that was registered in 2005 in the Funds of the World-wide Heritage of the Unesco maybe visited by each.
To the first floor of the house is located the apartment the more spacieux and most accessible most splendid to the public.
The owners made a decision to cross this step in 2002 to the occasion of the 150th birthday of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits for they noted that it is a matter of a lucrative business and they widened the field of the visits to the common spaces and to the attic including the terraces of toît.
The entrance ticket in the monument is not really dear and costs 16.50 Euros; the students, the retired, the groups and the possessors of tourist cards have 20 percent of reduction.
The sum is nonetheless above the price of enter into the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you quickly must find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit completely the house.
How to choose a matelas and a sommier: the women have other criteria that the men.
No framework ostentatoire, but rather the quality of the reserved surface to the to put to bed, therefore the matelas and the sommier give a real basis for a read voucher.
They of course must complete themselves harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are determining,: the weight, the size, the age, the health state as well as the sex of the owner.
The interior type in which one will place the matelas and the sommier is equally important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one sleeps not continually the matelas in latex are not fitting for they themselves "reheat" gently.
They have, moreover, a superior weight to the matelas in standard polyuréthane.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they have not equally enough canals of airiness to the heart and if they remain, what's more, on a solid board, they keep humidity. Mildew equally itself there can form.
The habit is so determining in the choice.
The one that passes the clear one time abroad where one uses frequently very thick matelas with a layer rammollissante, will feel with difficulty well on a low surface and lasts.
"It is as well as all the hokeyistes that return from NHL complain that they cannot sleep over there."
"For their tired shoulders, the feet and the coasts, they needed matelas with a layer rammollisante of foams lazy."
"Of such matelas are equally recommended for the people that suffer from diabetes that have a disturbance of the nervous system that therefore assume poorly" the news" joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova that specializes itself in the padded furnishings.
It is for that that some years ago the matelas with of foams it lazy conquered the hokeyistes as well as of other customers.
"Today any market well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example fitting matelas.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to be able to appreciate a foams lazy.
This "miracle" works simply.
She optimalise his rigidity and his form according to the absorbed heat or well adapts itself to the heat of your body.
Nothing does pressure on you and you will not return yourself in the night as after a difficult game.
You sleep simply better.
Foams it lazy works equally as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the matelas according to your size, add the length of the feet, is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180CM have therefore need of a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimal width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm is in all 180 cm.
For the beds to a single place, the singles for example, it is recommended taking at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of visit.
'Nevertheless it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you put to bed on the back should put you the in a manner comfortable hands with the lightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of the Saddlers mattress Makers and decorators that consecrates itself for a number of years to the problematic one of a sleep healthy and to the ergonomics of the furniture and the sign in the specialized schools.
For a bed to two places each needs his own sommier and matelas, therefore attention nevertheless during the well achât to choose the height of the matelas.
Otherwise it will not remain you that climb the sommier to different heights and that is not feasible on all the frameworks of bed.
The matelas foams should have a minimal height of 14 cm, the matelas to springs at least 15 cm, of that count for the layer of form and of ventilation at least three centimeters.
"To the key or in seated position on the matelas must not feel you the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Every required matelas a well determined type of sommier.
The bed sommier, when the matelas and the sommier are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The matelas get some fresh air very poorly; one must not wash it, which is done often auhourd'hui.
And since during the night one perspires normally of 0,2 to 0,75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the matelas begins recalling a big one (and blocked) sieve.
For that the specialists refuse to do the advertisement on a length of life of 25 years for a matelas or of a guarantee to life.
But all to his but.
And for that an experience counsel from the salesmen: for a matelas of 120/140cm, renounce, for the surface of the matelas, to hygiene or to the washing but add rather a matelas of protection that vouspouvez easily to withdraw and to wash.
And even so these days it is frequent to make surfaces with closing to glissière for all the body, that is to say that after the opening one has two parties (for the washing and the size of the machine to wash this is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the big models (and for a single person) becomes when one withdraws them a fight between a light weight and a truck on A ring.
Do you have in your bed a rigid board instead of a sommier?
Never!
To the maximum for a bed intend for the visitors for a single night.
Nevertheless equip the board (if it not there in has) of holes of ventilation and use the matelas to springs with a minimal height of 15CM with springs in sachets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A matelas in polyuréthane must not be part of a bed of this type.
For the sommiers to strips to unique position with 14/18 strips, the matelas in latex or said sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and of walnut of coconut), are ideal but this will always be better for you to have a matelas with more of strips, 28 and above, where the strips are doubled in the bottom party of the kidneys and that it is thus possible of some to regulate rigidity.
For the matelas to several positions it is not necessary to take matelas to springs for it does not reply to the position changes.
Next to the adjustability of the rigidity of the strips one can install equally what one calls a shoulder cradle.
It is a matter of a special liaison of the strips that allows doing pressure indeed to incline the strip for that the shoulder of the sleeping one "integrates itself" well.
For the men that have "the as wide shoulders as the back," this is really an important thing.
This thing already is envisioned by the manufacturers of matelas that for the "masculine" began using a zone rammollissante at the level of the shoulders.
But they equally think about the women - they offer them again a softer surface at the level of the hips.
For the customer more difficult there are sommiers to wings or to small plates with this than one calls a suspension multiforce.
The pressure disseminates itself in more of points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and inflated of air) on of good matelas and sommier, the "more" disparait.
The basic rule is a pillow all simple one: the pillow must support the head and its points must attain only the shoulders, for that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavian ones by exmple prefer.
When one is lengthened on the side, the pillow must put to level (with the cradle of shoulder of the sommier or the zone rammollie in the matelas) the height of the shoulders.
The modern matelas have again something common with the first ones to basis of straw and of grasses.
The manufacturers use again natural matters or several mixtures.
The tendency is equally to the matelas bio.
The first matters to basis of pétrôle, to leave of which ones one makes the polyuréthane, are replaced by natural oils, as for example oil of soja.
Almost all the known manufacturers use exactly the soja.
"The qualifying Bio for the matelas means that the heart is made to basis of natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the corporation Tropico More.
The natural matters are used equally for the surfaces of the matelas; the one of the first ones was the aloe vera.
But you there can add microphones capsules that develop perfumes of the forest or of lavender.
There exist the differences between the man and the woman.
While the extract of plants of birch for that the surface of the matelas absorbs the heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the surfaces "heat" the women.
The extract of red pepper accelerates the sanguine circulation and is therefore hotter for the weak sex.
Did the prefer current?
The made matelas from foams cold (she has more pores with a cell perturbed structure therefore more breathing than the standard polyuréthane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidity of the foam cold gives matelas polyzones that know precisely where is located its head, the bottom of the back and the feet.
You will pay a quality matelas from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their parameters for health have less than VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In Czech Republic, it is Gumotex that attained the first place.
Economiser for the matelas and the sommier is not simple.
One can time in time to have in the framework of special actions from the manufacturers or producers two matelas for the price of a single one.
As for example the corporation Magniflex that proposes matelas Duofreeze with of foams it to memory Memory sewn to the surface for 11990 crowns.
One evidently can take the second one free.
The era of the foam lazy or viscoélastiques with a cell open structure and a big thickness was started up with the matter Tempur to a rhythm "cosmic."
That began as matter for the NASA parceque the astronauts underwent to the start of the factors of huge load.
The Tempur itself rammollit to the heat and hardens itself, on the contrary, to the cold one.
It therefore perfectly adapts himself to the hot human body and distributes him an optimum pressure.
It is for that ideal against the slept evil and for a comfort increase during sleep.
Foam them viscoélastiques use themselves not only for the matelas but equally for the products for health, as the special cushions for the feet that relieve the legs and the system streaks.
The Czech manufacturers use for example foams it EucathermC or Twinsaver or same type.
The devices to follow the people are more and more asked by the parents that desire to oversee their children.
The fear for their affable child more and more of people to think about to oversee them through a GPS.
The system, set up at first to look for the cars all just as well can be employed to trace the movement of the people and to help for certain cases as by exmple the one of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a match wood but will be soon size of a watch.
The case of the small Anicka moved a big number of people and they began looking for the means of more better to protect their children.
Even if the price is to disrupt their private life.
"We strive to say to all that it is not a matter no spying but only of another mean to diminish the probability that there is another tragedy," declares Petr Pilin of the corporation MAcro Weil that is the one of the suppliers of devices of drawing on the Czech market.
"I had that there can be cases of bad job of such devices, as for example to put it in the bag of a person that is not at the current, but I did not again meet of such case."
"The majority of the people are customers that buy actually the product for reasons of security, adds Pilin.
According to him the children always should know to which ends is used "wood" and how to use it in case of urgency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child does not want to concern him a thing of this type, it himself in débarassera.
'And even the smallest ones can show a big creativity when it is a matter to rid deliberately something when they do not want to be under check ."
"The portable telephones, that can cut themselves as these drawing devices, already brought the parents to long expectations," asserts Bockova.
According to her, the Fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a matter of a prepared rapt, the author all will do for that the child does not have any electronic device that can localize it."
"Currently, this is the telephone."
"As soon as will develop the casting off of drawing, they (the criminals) will look for them them also for the sale will be supported by a publicity campaign."
"In of such case the criminals will always be in advance on the police," says the psychologist.
She had all just like of such devices can help at the time of a not aggression prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the corporation RC Monitoring, that proposes services of drawing so for the cars that for the people, asserts that to have this device type can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an aggression.
"The device can be defined of such manner that it is in uniform transmission after a determined period."
"If the device is destroyed, there remains anyway the last position of the concerned person."
'The dearer devices have equally an inclinomètre that signals immediately the position of the person that slipped and meet again in lengthened position without budging ," indicates Cech.
According to him the portable intelligent said telephones that are equipped of a system of navigation, can propose a comparable service after formatting it with a special prologiciel.
The problem of the current systems of drawing is that it is a matter is of a similar device to those that one carries in pendentif of the size of a wood of matches is at the smallest telephone devices.
One always can lose them.
According to Pilina of the corporation Macro Weil, this is the reason why tests are taken currently to do the devices that resemble numerical watches towns.
"That will have the advantage that the eventual aggressor will not be able to recognize the drawing device."
"Or well it will realize some after a certain time, which will have given to the police a little more time," it adds.
What the drawing device is developed under the form of bracelet or of pendentif, it utilisiera always the same technology that to trace cars.
It is a matter of a combination of systems of acquisition of a position by means of the GPS (that is used often in autonavigation) and of a function of a portable telephone that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has explosive so many lines that she could do the turn of the Czech Republic with. But she can hold only two years.
The army bought for 445 km of used lines for the explosive ones.
Already last year the Ministry of the Defense about it had bought 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the length of life of the lines is of two to four years maximum.
The army bought the explosive lines to the anonymous corporation STV Group for 40 millions of crowns.
The general staff gave as reason of the achât of a huge quantity of explosive lines to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to hold do by the pyrotechniciens of the army, that MF DNES contacted, it in spring that even the generals, the officers having an order, secretaries or well the personnel of household should have each year an exercise to the explosive ones.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of the defense and Vlastimil Picek, ordering army do not do exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of explosive lines.
To this distance corresponds 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reserves of the army there could provide for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic entrainement of each of the new professionals it suffices for the more than 2 m of explosive lines, as the say the experts, that means that the army with his new purchase assured - with equally the consumption of special unities and genius - reserves for the 225 mentioned years.
Nevertheless the soldiers of the brigade of quick intervention recently pitied itself to the Minister Vondra that they do not have almost any munitions for their weapons of fist and that the shooting meetings are limited because of the money needs.
About the lack of linen of body one not about it speaks.
"And I do not take myself the head if they buy at our place a so big quantity of explosive lines."
"And this is their decision and they know really what they do."
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as merchants to satisfy," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of the defense, argues the achât of hundreds of km of lines explosive by the Fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group does state nevertheless of only four years of length of life of the explosive lines and the pyrotechniciens of the police and army of only two years.
"If they perfectly are stored in the deposits, that can go even until four years," says the one two that does not want that his name is published had consideration to the critic of the army.
The delay of length of past life, every munition must be tested to see if she remains upright and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are not nevertheless free and cost again money.
The other argument of the ministry is a due reduction to the quantity for 445 km of ties explosive.
"They cost us 60 percent of less than the supply of the past year of 245 km," indicates the spokesperson Pejsek that acts as an interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the ministry of the defense.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the explosive lines of the pyrotechniciens of the police that neutralize the munitions of the second World War or well the one after the Soviet army, does not surpass the 1500 meters.
And the police always orders only the necessary quantity of munitions to be used before the end of their length of life.
That was established for reasons of security of the pyrotechniciens and for strength what's more to obtain in a manner more supple of the types of explosive lines more modern and more reliable.
The ministry of the defense has today big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of munitions originating time of the Pact of Warsaw when the strong czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men got ready to move itself, cape on the Rhine.
Which awaits in some years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old explosive lines that she buys today "cheap."
Until today I profit from contacts that I obtained thanks to the competitions.
The sale under frankness of his hotel well helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of conqueror of the competition of the better individual Contractor.
The conqueror of the competition of the better individual Contractor for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, contractor of 28 years.
His adventure towards the succés is as in a film.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, it went counts that to Libérec it lacked a site of housing of quality to a reasonable price.
Of its economies on what it had won when it worked abroad and with the assistance of a ready bank one it bought a small building of 5 apartments to demolished half.
Knowing that it was again studying in trosième year of superior studies, it was a courageous action.
"The report between the quality and the price of a housing in our region gave me envies to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
It began has to rent the first apartment rebuilds to the foreign workers.
It réinvestit the profit in the building that it transformed in pension with 54 beds.
Since that moment, his action of contractor allowed him to open to Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity closely of 300 beds of all categories of housing.
The most comfortable one of them was until all recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it arrived some for him another of identical quality.
"We come just to sign a contract with a hotel to Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of frankness and of other candidates to the frankness of the hotels Pytloun showed themselves," the number 1 of the contractors of the past year.
"And for the sale of the license for the placement in functioning of a hotel on a large scale the victory to the competition of the contractor of the year well served, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Libérec and its vicinity.
"The people recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," it recalls.
It recommends the participation to this competition to all those that strive to do something.
This is not necessary to win but any timeliness to be visible is good.
It says that it uses until today its contacts and knowledge that it could not have obtained from another manner.
"With those that I met thanks to the competition I began maintaining commercial relations uniformly.
According to him, the fame linked to the succés had an impact equally on the employees.
And it has about 70.
"I observe at their place especially the loyalty and the pride to have been involved themselves in something that was usually recognized."
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us all together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish to my successor a better year than the one than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of the victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the direction of the objective of the winning Farmet has the worse moments behind oneself.
The one that came to look for the price to Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the corporation Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which these it transformed a workshop of outillage to Ceska Skalice in a firm to the sales of 100 millions of crowns.
'I can say that the reward encouraged not only me my equally my assistants and increased our confidence in itself to fight against the competition ," declares today the winning one of the competition of last year.
At first history of the corporation Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And thus when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the Communists, it did not hesitate a long time, refused a career in a firm where it worked to the era, and created a corporation with some friends in the entourage of his father for the bathtub manufacture in plastic.
Not very a long time after they began specializing itself in the presses for vegetable oil.
It became after eighteen years more big manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
The corporation was known even in the non specialized public after the obtained succés to the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to really more better to know the brand Farmet but also the foreign partners that began going counts than they collaborated with a corporation that obtained the biggest succés in his country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the flowed year do not n'e happened to Farmet only ldans the euphoria of the victory.
The evaluation of the corporation had been done from the economical results of 2008 and in left 2009.
And exactly in 2009 this was the year more difficult for the sale of machines of engineering.
To the more top of the crisis, that did not really touch the citizens, the corporations were obliged to stop their projects of investments and to begin limiting their achâts again equipment and technologies.
"We did not escape evidently to this position."
"The sales fell of 40 percent, and we dûmes to limit our production and even to dismiss," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A corporation viable must know that of time in time it is necessary to take unpopular measures.
But they managed the position correctly and preserved results bénéficiares even if they were inferior to those that they had before the crisis.
Nevertheless to Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in the research and the development.
"We constructed with allocations a center of formation and of research, reinforced the presentation of the corporation in parlors expositions international and won the principal rewards in the national expositions," says Zdarsky.
All leaves us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires climb back up and with them the number of employees equally.
"To the new conqueror I wish this pleasant feeling of the victory but in an atmosphere calms," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates from the insane regulations.
The investigation on the Absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the clan of the matters.
Certain absurd regulations could be eliminated.
The not very glorious conqueror of this year of the investigation on the Absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring in the offices of the documents that the officials can obtain one line.
More third of the 4000 votes voted for that.
For example, the administrations of the social matters asked an extract paper of the register of the commerce while the official can obtain it in two clicks of mouse.
That changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of the social assurance no longer will ask the extract of the register of the commerce for the checks of payments of the assurance," indicated Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Administration of the social assurance (CSSZ).
To put emphasis on all the regulations and decrees that the corporations and the contractors must fill in Czech Republic and do eliminate those that are absurd is the direction of this competition of the Absurdity of the year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the clan of the matters organized by Hospodarske noviny and has again a bigger popularity.
So last year 3000 votes showed themselves, it is at least 4000 this year that brought their voice.
And this is not astonishing, it ya in our country more various legal obligations that do nothing but to brake the business, et,ce, more and more.
"We are maybe to the number of documents to fill for the fiscal declarations to the first places in the world," declares Karel Havlicek of the Association of the small and average businesses and contractors of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the activity of contractor becomes a proclaimed goal of all the governments the latter years.
In comparison with the entire world the position in Czech Republic not at all improves.
According to the world bank the Czech Republic is situated in the 74 ème places for what concerns the conditions for the business, is 8 places of more in comparison with last year.
The competition of the Absurdity of the year was set up for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Do not import that can do state each year of administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April to at the end of September, deadline before the fence of the competition.
To realize it ya the website www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for "the antiprix" and leaves the public to vote during the months of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the biggest number of voice is declared conqueror.
Until the last investigation of last year, it is a hundred, or exactly 105 regulations and décrêts that lost their existence direction.
The remarks are sent by the contractors but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the "finalists" competition, therefore among the nominated is located for example the obligation that the vehicles of discussion of the expressways and quick ways pay the tolls, or although the contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every other year.
The list of the seven suggestions is published on the site of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, that always begins at first November on the Place Venceslas to Prague, is a part of a happening to which one uniformly participate personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for the small and average businesses of Czech Republic or well Petr Kuzel, president of the Room of commerce of Czech Republic, attended the peak moment of the competition.
'Economical prosperity cannot work when the State puts âtons in the legs of the contractors and for that my objective is to eliminate, each year, at least three tens of paragraphs that today do nothing but to complicate the business ," to informer Martin Kocourek, the Minister of the industry and commerce.
The effort to eliminate from the absurd décrêts is not a blow of sword in water.
In 2007, which did not please the people was the obligation of the contractors to declare three days before in the office for the individual business to the place where is located the business, the intention to go to an exposition or a pélerinage with a stand.
This obligation was eliminated with the ammendement of the Law on the individual business.
The second obligation the done more overwhelmingly support in 2007, that was to declare in the office work a trip of service for a foreign employee on 30 days, was eliminated with the text of Law on what one calls the green card.
And all is ok until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the décrêt for the physiothérapeutes to have a big mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
That was changed by order of the ministry of health last year-l' obligation to have a refrigerator was eliminated.
A new category rewards the responsible firms socially.
Are evaluated the ecological, humanitarian projects, of formation or again sportsmen.
The novelty of this year of the competition of Hospodarske Noviny, that already exists for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the support to the reasonable and business just.
"We want to support the corporations that oversee the impacts of their business on the environment and take a socially responsible activity," indicates Patrick Bartholdy, to manage it regional of the operator of portable telephone, the firm Vodaphone, that is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this under category of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered themselves the corporations that do not have any succés with a single objective in the long term for the business.
The adventure of each of them is rich inspirations and an independent item would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different of each one other one can consider their activity of support and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
For the one of the cases, that concerns the handicapped people and the personal problems or of health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the very Czech Republic is located not example the corporation of prologiciels pragoise And Netera that supports the informal athletic team creation of their employees that participate next to number of tournaments in different athletic disciplines.
Another example of responsible firm of the region of Pardubice is the corporation isolit-bravo that is for 17 years the principal contributor to the allocation funds that sponsors the handicapped children.
To the fact to take care of the employees having health problems, one can quote again The old factory of manufacture of paper of Podebrad that in employs more than 70 percent and that, for that, obtained the title of the Responsible firm for the region of central Bohême and that placed itself third in the region to the competition of the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
To Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial corporation, that won for have introduced schedules of work soften and even diminished until 35 o'clock a week in average et,ce, without, proportionellement, salary decrease.
The jury him déverné entitles it equally because she achête in priority to the Czech manufacturers, supports an activity ditoyenne in the entourage close and worries about the environment.
"We strive to recycle the most possible one for than our activity of business and our administration have the less than impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the corporation.
The responsible corporation IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and set them up for every laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboards, encourages their work to residence and uses the services of catering of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We support in addition foundation THE man in the shadow that helps the community Rom local," says Ondrej Suchy representing it corporation.
To the very last row is located, equally for its activities, a corporation of Washing and cleaning of the region of Karlovy Vary, that participates in the retirement insurance of its employees under the form of bonus above the standard ones.
"In our corporation contribute us to the food, the transportation, the increase of the qualifications and to the leisures," says Joseph Strapac of the corporation of construction of bruntal Czasch, conqueror for the moravie-silésie region.
Registered Etaient automatically in the category corporation Responsible, all the regional finalists for the competition of the Firm of the year of Vodaphone, that had replied to the questionnaires in joined piece of the document for the inscription and had related back to it the organizer before August 15.
The poorly full or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in lists had not replied to the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified competition" principal" the Firm of the year of Vodaphone."
"The independent inscriptions are not possible for it is a matter of one under category of the principal competition of the Firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
To the Funds for the Earths to Plzen, the police proceeded to arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Funds for the Earths to Plzen, the anti-corruption police proceeded to arrests the latter days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and merchant in real estate Lubos. G.
This one had striven to handle exactly a call of public offers for the regulation of a request of restitution of such manner that the proposed land is obtained by a determined candidate.
This one had to pay to Lubos G. a millions of half crowns.
"For the moment I only can confirm that the police sues a person for offence of initiate in the framework of a call of offers and of a public concour." declared for the newspaper Pravo the boss of the Floor of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to furnish more explanations for the investigation is in course.
The policemen put back after 24 hours this contractor of 46 years in liberty.
For knowledge in what way it could influence on a public competition, one can only to speculate had consideration to the so few official information.
To a question of Pravo, the spokesperson of the Funds of the Lands Lubomira Surrounded indicated that the policemen actually had proceeded to an arrest to Plzen on a place of separated work and, this, during the public competition.
"It was a matter of a customer and in any case of an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Surrounded has as true name "Call to propose rights for the land transfer according to the Law on the earth" and is set up when show themselves several profitable candidates of right.
"These people propose, in the framework of the call, a superior value of their rights to resitutions that must be regulated before that is announced the value of the land."
"According to the proposed rights a classification of the buyers is set up and the Funds of the Lands transfers next the land to the person that proposed the rights the more tops," explained the Spokesperson of the Funds.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the news concerning the people that had registered themselves to the call and as it is itself, equally, a person bénéficiare for having bought a big number of rights to restitutions, it had proposed to the candidates to the not land to participate in the competition.
And it took doubtless by the fact to withdraw itself.
Which would explain why it had so many money in his possession at his questioning.
Lubos G. had contacts widely above the standard ones to the FdT (Funds of the Lands).
It figured in the matter of the former boss of the FdT Vaclav Sankot that was followed to the penal one to have to edit lands for which one already had edited the decision of set up of a construction.
Exactly Lubos G. had obtained for example lands intend for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and places where had to be constructed the artery of accés to the industrial zone of Borske Polishes.
Later it exchanged it with the city hall for a building in the historic center of the city of which the value is of very far superior one.
The city hall was obliged to accept for otherwise she risked putting the construction in peril by a locking of the lands.
The households will pay a supplement of about one hundred crowns monthly for the lodging.
The households will have from January to pay a supplement not only for all the types of energy but equally for water and purification, the supplies of heating and to certain places the rents will increase equally.
The families will have therefore from January to pull of their purse until about one hundred crowns monthly more now.
The electricity increases of 4,6 percent, the almost gas 2 dearer percent, in certain localities will have to pay you until a tenth one of more the supply of water and in many places the supplies of central heating will be also dearer.
The increase of the electricity should be close to for the households in apartment the 100 crowns anuellement of more currently.
Nevertheless all the suppliers diminished the prices of the electricity being given the sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of the renewable energies, notably the batteries photovoltaÏques.
The gas increases moderately but of course the moment the people have the more need to heat and have therefore the biggest consumption.
One can therefore to count equally about one hundred crowns what's more.
Although the electricity and the gas increase in the very czech republic, the change of the price of the central heating differs city in city.
It principally is the biggest towns that plan the increase of the prices.
For example the households to Pardubice or to Hradec Kraloce will pay to count January for the central heating almost 50 crowns of more by months, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns yearly.
For the inhabitants of Prague gets ready an increase of 9 percent for water and the purification for the case where the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragois will pay a supplement of 6,8 percent.
The price to Prague still will cause left the more bottoms in comparison with the country completely.
In Bohême of the north, where the prices already do left the more students, water and purification increase of 7,4 percent.
The prices of the rents will increase for example noticeably in the 450 thousand apartments in housing from January that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example the corporation CPI Byty that possesses to Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided an increase until 100 percent.
Those that will not be agreed with the new increase of the rents will be translated in front of the courts by the corporation.
The regulated rents that pay the people in near of 300 thousand apartments could increase next year of 10 percent.
The Czech children themselves saoûlent to the rhum and to the fernet. Beer no longer is method and acts all gently.
The fernet, the rhum, the vodka and in a manner exceptional equally the better brand of whisky are flown to the parents.
It is drinks that bring most often those that itself saoûlent, that have not again fifteen years, between the hands of the doctor.
The children that are cared for to the hospital for relapses do not do the exception.
That results from the experience of the doctors that meet similar cases to the admissions of the departments children of the hospitals.
"Beers or the wines no longer are method for it is necessary of the time to be saoûl."
'The tendency is really to strong alcohols ," indicates for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Boss of the department children of the hospital of Horovice in central Bohême.
"When they succeed swiping a bottle to dad in the closet, it is a matter of sometimes of wisky but it is the fernet and the vodka that prevail '.
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not to feel it," explains the Boss of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson of the hospital Motol, gives him equally reason.
"Usually, this is rhum or fernet."
"This is today fashionable alcohol notably in the elementary schools."
"In certain cases, it was a matter of slivovice that they brought back house," added Jurinova.
According to the Boss of department Pélikan, see drunk children of age thirteen to fourteen years to the admissions to the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working to Horovice since last year, it was at Motol where it exercised ten years exactly in pediatrics where the ambulances brought pupils of the wide completely drunk vicinity.
"A girl was hospitalized thus four times
"She acommencé his career to twelve years when she was brought with 3,5 for thousand of alcohol dansle blood with what's more a mixture with extasy," described the doctor this particularly important case.
"She was at the Park of the Expositions of Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting is that it appeared not strange to the mother that his girl is leaves 48 hours" says astonished the Director of the Department.
It is exactly the unselfishness of the parents or well their tolerance out of the ordinary facing the Fact that their reject devote themselves to the drink that are the principal cause of the développment of the alcoholism of the children.
According to the specialists, one does not speak nevertheless of the dependance, in his strict direction, for the children.
"Under term alcoholic one hears a chronic dependance to the alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that about it result but that one does not rediscover with the children."
"With those that use the acool to repetition, it is a matter rather of a social family significantly unfavorable back-ground," explained the Boss of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year to the mi-novembre in the pediatrics clinic to Motol.
Are integrated in the stastistiques only the cases with a grâve intoxication necessitating the hospitalization.
The drunk children that are after the brought back cares of urgency at their place by the parents or by the police, are not counted.
Besides the cases of the children that sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after the school, it exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which ones one can count: the day of the witches, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Is they drink by vexation after bad results is on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the vacation."
"Of course I lived to the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at one go," underlined Pélikan.
The drunk child that passed the night to the hospital in désintoxciation under medical check is paradoxically in better position than the one that returned at his place and suffers the day following the "hangover."
The headaches in the morning provoked by a dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and of nutritious elements of which the organism needs.
"They are for that more better allot since they pass an excellent evening then a soft awakening and nothing does not do them poorly."
"They only are astonished place where they are located," adds knowing Pélikan that of time in time that ruins the good mood of the patients at least with the grade to pay for their cares.
The transportation by ambulance and the hospitalization on bed of intensive cares can go even to tens of thousands of crowns.
"Of time in time, I applied that as a means of education in in cash to these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could pass all the summer in seasonal work to reimburse a single evening," added Pélikan.
Nevertheless, according to him, the insurance companies of health in their managements in regression, that should recover from the parents the loads linked to the cares, do not treat the cases of drunk children.
Two airplanes L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two airplanes L-159 of the five in all, against which these the Ministry of the Defense exchanged airplanes of transportation Put C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where sits the airplane manufacturer Put eads.
It is the first time that of the devices of this type become the property of someone of other that the Czech army.
They nevertheless were abroad in the framework of exercises or of flights of demonstration.
It is a matter of the versions biplaces of the L-159T1 that were until now in service in the Czech army and that were in condition to flight.
Lestrois devices remaining are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These park for the moment with Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary one - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the department of press of the Ministry of the defense, the physical departure of the airplanes of Vodochody is for the moment unknown.
'The airplanes L-159 single-seater foreseen ones for the exchange were taken on of the had stocked since a long time without that doing not cause loads or additional investments for the Ministry of the defense ."
"The biplaces L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," declared for Pravo Pejsek.
It jousted that the army will not remain without biplace since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 millions of crowns for the transformation of four single-seater L-159 unused ones in two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first device in July, the second one being foreseen to the delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS was involved itself to introduce the airplanes in the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it clearly is indicated that the one that takes the airplanes L-159 in account is EADS and that they will serve to the entrainement of the pilots of member nations of NATO."
"It is consequently the matter of the one that takes into account to determine how to realize that," indicated Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, there is some time, that the Spanish army is not interested by the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for an airplane Put and the purchase of three others had for 3,5 billion crown was ratified last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The ministry of the defense did not launch call of offers and contacted directly EADS.
The direction of the defense argued while the exchange assures a future exportation of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought to Aéro Vodochody 72 devices and uses only 24, wanting to sell the remainder.
The airplane purchase Put will have probably judicial implications.
The European Commission nevertheless carried complaint against the Czech ministry of the defense with the Course of European justice for the airplanes should have been chosen in the framework of a call of offers to the European ladder and in any case while contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army already took delivery of three airplanes Put, the last one should arrive at the airport of Prague Kbely in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of weak risk of cancer
The men that have the longer index than the ring finger are exposed to a least risk to have a cancer of the prostate.
This is the surprising conclusion of a published study Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
That can depend on the level of the male hormone the testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger uses simple test of risks cancer of the prostate, notably for the men before 60 years," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor to the Institute for the research on the cancer to the university of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should subject to themselves the test of the cancer of the prostate, notably while combining with the genetic risk or of other factors aggrâvants as the antécedents of health familiaux,a added Eeles.
During the period of 1994-2009 she followed with its colleagues in more than 1500 Great Britain attained patients of a cancer of the prostate and at the same time close to three thousand healthy men.
More half of the participants to the study had the index of the upright hand does more run than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those that had the fingers of the same length, one found the same probability of a cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those that had the longer index than the ring finger the risk nevertheless fell to 33 percent, for the men before 60 years the decrease of the risk attained 87 percent.
The report of length of the two quoted fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates notably different levels of sexual hormones to which ones is exposed the child in the uterus.
To less than testosterone corresponds a longer index.
Preceding research had showed that it is exactly the testosterone that helps the development of a cancer of the prostate.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, famous Czech généticien and former president of the Academy of the sciences, said for CTK that it is during the course of this study but that it does not seem him, it adorned, that the relation between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely shown."
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the expressways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by the snow.
On the roads and the sidewalks, there is most of the time of the compact snow, the déblayeurs worked the very night in a lot of places.
The expressway D5 is closed in the morning between the 89th one and the 93rd kilometer heading for Rozvadov because of several accidents of trucks and of cars and the auroute D1 to Brno heading for Prague undergoes the same goes out.
The dispatcher of the Automobile club central (UAMK) said it to the news
To the 91st kilometer a truck was injured, to the 93rd one two trucks collided, the accident did the injureds.
Several cars met again equally in the ditch.
The problems are equally on the expressway D1 to the 185 ème kilometer heading for Prague.
Two trucks themselves there collided
The drivers should go out immediately following Brno to the 190th kilometer or go by Brno and enter next to the 182nd kilometer to Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed themselves to this place.
Egalement on the expressway D11, there is an accident and, this, just to the arrival to Prague.
To Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 Celsius degrees.
Lines of cars create themselves for example to Prosek, the street Sterboholska is also mouthful.
The means of transportation more sure is the subway.
The trams take delay for example on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the staff of crisis of Prague again must combine itself.
The steel-tipped ways and the airport meet equally problems.
The Czech iron Ways already had to eliminate because of the snow 7 liaisons of quick ones.
The lines for example of Prague to Kralupy or well of Prague to Beroun have problems
The travelers should check the current position.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed since Wednesday 11h00 in the night until 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most of the roads in Moravie of the South already are roulable but in repeat student of vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three lateral roads are impraticables, on the road of Brno it begins to there to have by places of the flurries of snow and on the road of Blansko the chaines are obligatory to pass certain ways of communications in the placed places higher.
The region of Vyskov was part of the places the done more touch.
Until now are closed the axes: Rousinov-slavkov, bohdalice-kucerov and also saratice-milesovice
To clean them it will be necessary maybe to send déneigeuses and strawberries to snow.
One cannot for the moment to estimate when they will be roulables.
On the road of Hodonin the prudence is harshness in the region of the white Carpathes.
On the roads that are, had consideration to the protection of the nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is anyway a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czech, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the more in Bohême of the north, with, often, until 18 centimeters of snow.
In the moravie-silésie region, it fell until 15 centimeters of snow.
The enneigement disparait in Czech progressively.
The Americans have a new one "intelligent weapon"
The American army sent in Afghnistan a new weapon "intelligent," known only under the name of code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict over there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their profit.
The new weapon is as a precise great canon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of some meters.
The special munitions of gauges 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing an explosive highly breaking one, works in fact as of small grenades.
One can program the munitions of such manner that they will explode to the contact of the target but also to any no their ballistic trajectory.
One can therefore to use it against an enemy that hides itself behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It not not is more protected from in top and when falls him over a deadly rain of brightnesses of steel, that can put it outside fight equally.
According to Richard Audette that took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon of infantry that uses the technology "intelligent."
"The soldier uses it essentially of such manner that it finds the target, sends him a ray laser that determines the distance, obtains thus a point of precise aim, according to which it corrects his aimed site and leans on the relaxation.
"Let's say that you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads itself and pulls to the distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters, indicated Audette.
400 relocated jobs
The group Fujitsu relocates his affiliate of Bad Homburg towards Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 assistants will transfer to Astro Park their place of work that is located currently to the building of offices of the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates his succursale of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As asserted it Wednesday the specialized giant in the manufacture and the maintenance of the computers, the next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, situated so far on the place Marienbader of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, complex immense of situated offices on the street Lyoner Straße of the Neighborhood Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that to average term, the group there should group together 100 other again scattered jobs so far in the region.
The housing offer was extremely attractive. Besides, the offices to open area of Astro Park suit better to the method of work of the assistants.
To Bad Homburg equally, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The general director, Bernd Wagner, declared: "Frankfurt-niederrad constitutes for us an essential location having access to a remarkable infrastructure."
It asserts that the connection to the airport is exactly of a big importance for a global business as Fujitsu.
The new move one of an important business inside the region gave rise to yesterday the joy of the winning and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The person in charge of the economical matters of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), declared that once again, a "planetary actor" had thus been conquered.
This is an "extraordinary profession of faith relating to the establishment place."
Fujitsu suits the city and his establishment constitutes an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we proposed our assistance to this business," declared Mr. Korwisi.
Nevertheless, friendly relations could not have changed anything to the difficulties of the manufacturer of computers facing the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
In the last analysis, the economical reasons would have been determining.
It is a matter henceforth to avoid that a so exceptional place does not remain unoccupied during a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and lessor of the building will show itself cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place of the town Hall, used so far by the corporation Fujitsu and the "vertical small" neighbor, as well as the remainder of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the project of controversial construction of the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and of a developer of projects deprived, a new entry of the city was created between the train station and the town Hall. This one gave rise to many critics, not only because of the impressive installation of the surfaces that served formerly in left parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the corporation of notation and of counsels in investment, Feri, the computer manufacturer for the systems of distribution of the trips, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer to the again associated era to Siemens, moved in the buildings.
In 2006, The German group of specialized Frankfurt immobilien-chancen repurchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time that the real estate funds Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish corporation Falcon Real Estate Investments HIS basis to Madrid.
The group Fujitsu of which sits it is located to Tokyo considers itself as the third one bigger supplier of computer products to the world.
For example, she puts computers and waiters at the disposal of the businesses and assures equally the essential service.
His established succursale in the region of the Rhine Hand is the one of the more important ones in Germany: Fujitsu counts assuredly well more employees to Munich.
The succursale, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install itself to frankfurt-niederrad. The filial others present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a named business TDS.
For that, 7000 square meters took in housing in the building Astro Park.
This old complex of twenty years, of which the name recalls his plan in star form, shelters among others sits it Confederacy of the electronic and industry electrotechnical.
Expulsion of the waiter by Amazon - Threaten against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks tests more and more difficulties.
The supplier of services Internet Amazon expelled from its waiters the specialized site in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude hides maybe political pressures suffered after the publications of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic grades.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, stays apparently in England.
To the United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with always more of force.
The cyber-activistes group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to his accommodated waiter so far in America and looks for henceforth a hébergeur in Europe.
During this time, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, that is looked for by Interpol, stays probably in Great Britain, according to published the news by newspapers.
"Wikileaks exclude from the waiter Amazon."
"Expression liberty to the country of liberty," indicated Wednesday (local hour) the cyber-activistes to the origin of the revelations through the social network Twitter.
Little beforehand, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had eliminated the documents of Wikileaks of its waiters.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic grades, the cyber-activistes had recourse to the Service Web of Amazon (AWS) in order to be able to attain the biggest number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Tremendous, our dollars henceforth are spent to take care of the people in Europe."
When expression liberty puts a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The chain of television CNN, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, retrieved that Amazon forbade to Wikileaks to use its waiters after the investigation conducted by the assistants of the senator Joe Lieberman.
The president of the commission of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott in opposition, retrieved the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have wished that Amazon takes this measure earlier had consideration to the publications preceding by Wikileaks of classified the news" asserted the senator.
Simultaneously, Mr. Liebermann called the other countries to refuse the usage of the waiters by the plateforme.
"Wikileaks be a question of illegal, monstrous manner and without scruples. This fact, she puts our national security in danger and in peril life everywhere through the world," according to a communiqué of the independent senators.
"No conscious business of its responsibilities, that she is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to broadcast the content of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, that is looked for by Swedish authorities because it is suspected rape, figures on the list of people in demands by Interpol.
According to of the news broadcast by the of London newspaper "The Independant," the Australian of 39 years lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it it is located himself.
The cyber-activiste constantly qualified intrigues orchestrated by its detractors the engaged pursuits in opposition by Sweden.
The Spokesperson of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, declared to London that of the threats were hurled against the site.
"Calls even were launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
This is the reason why Assange fears particularly for his security, declared Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide itself.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to the declarations done in north America.
In America, the republican former governor of the Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the people in charge of the revelations done by Wikileaks is followed and executed for treason.
To Canada, the counselor of the Head of state Mr. stephen Harper declared to the television, to the in a manner ironic evidence, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama can "to use a Drone."
During this time, a debate released itself between the white House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson of the American president, Mr. Barack Obama, qualified of "ridiculous and absurd" the Fact that Mr. assange demanded the resignation of the secretary of state Hilary Clinton if this one was responsible of the given order to the diplomats, and divulged all recently, to deliver itself to activities of spying.
"I know not exactly why we must take care of the opinion of an individual owner of a website," declares Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign political and the interests of this country are well more important than the affirmations of a website."
The American government pass henceforth completely to the essay bench the protection of its bases of data.
According to a communiqué of the white House, Mr. Russell Breadth, assistant director of the Center of the anti-terrorist fight, was named responsible to fight against the escapes.
Mr. Breadth in charge of setting up "the necessary structural reformations" render essential after the disclosures of the cables diplomatic by Wikileaks.
The white House has equally the will to verify the means by which these all the administration exchanges and protects the pieces of information.
In addition, the American government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of the dissidents and of the campaigning so never these were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We all implemented to come into contact with them" indicated the Spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that proves itself necessary."
The university of the Ice
To the" university Gelato" of Bologne, one prepares the ice confectioners to the better seasons of the year.
The course of initiation of three days organized to the intention of the futures glaciers had a very big success and attracted of the come visitors of entire everyone.
To the fact, from is which coming the very ice?
Glacier and machine to ice.
The glacier, that is to say in German the confectioner of somewhat old-fashioned ice, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of manufacture of the ice.
The turbine to ice removes the cream of ice of the refrigerated window using a spatula, the disposes in the honeycomb and next begins selling it.
To know it, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'emilia in the province of Bologne.
But whoever wishes in more knowledge on the ice, cannot avoid "gelato-university" Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières was founded the university of ice in 2003 so that the ice creams gone out of its machines reply everywhere to Italian ideals students.
The course of initiation of three days organized to the intention of the futures glaciers had a very big success and attracted of the come visitors of everywhere in the world.
Are equally offered special courses concerning the ice of chocolate and spreading itself on several days. All the same, meetings practice are organized in the private glacerie.
In the middle of the crisis of the forty, a number of people dream of a new career, of others risk themselves simply to realize their burning desire on the ice smooths.
This time, this are 40 come participants of 19 countries of all the continents, Brazil to the Saudi Arabia while going through the Hungary.
Jacky, education artistic professor come California is enamoured of the movement Slow Food. It wants to propose in the future an European product of quality to the country of the industrial Ice.
Anke of Berlin is counseled in management of business and she wants, after some years, pull something unique of this testing trade for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream to open a glacerie to Cairo.
A native man of Malta and a come other of Brazil would like to improve the quality of the frozen cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because its children love the Italian frozen creams.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari explains first to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ices.
Is determining not only the good flavor, but equally silky flexibility and the good consistency.
Nevertheless, Luciano does not forget during the course of the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, usually, south: "The Italian ice is simply the better one: and then she preserves again a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in the manufacture appears completely simple.
Luciano towards the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, powder of milk, of Sugar and stabilizers in a big mixer that heats all to 85 degrees grace an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It opens next an installed faucet on the machine: it goes out a white cream of bases pasteurized, foundation of all the sorts of ices to the milk.
The formative one as soon as is assailed with question: Is it possible to make ice while using only the natural substances without stabilizer?
How one can to give free expression to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact to leave itself to induce in error by the spirit of the time.
The one that speaks only ices "made from the natural ingredients," has maybe despite that used of the stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example flour of seed of obtained guar from the bean of guar.
It is evidently possible to make ice without using stabilizer, only it is necessary to sell it within a period of 24 hours, otherwise she collapses and the customer will crunch nothing other that of the granules of ice.
Certain modifications of the basic mass are allowed.
That becomes more fascinating with the flavoring.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one obtains in the ray fruit or candy stores of the supermarket.
In addition, there exist the powder and pasta.
"The suppliers will attempt all to pass you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"Nevertheless, you all simply should try."
Is in the recipes of sorbets to the fruit with of Sugar and fresh fruit.
Is in the frozen creams made from the white basic mass that, while there adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when one there adds powder of cocoa, the possible basis of all the desserts to the chocolate.
Now, all the participants to the course must pass to the usage of the machines to ice.
Luciano invites them time in time to make four sorts of ices: to the vanilla, to the chocolate, to the moka and to the hazelnut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less than flavoring of vanilla or of other natural ingredients.
The different sorts of ices to the fruit are equally subjected to the same experience.
More of aromatic substances, more of purées of fruit: from the standpoint taste, that is not absolutely better.
The ice to the consisting of hazelnuts not necessarily the taste of the walnut, when she is composed largely hazelnuts.
The ice to the kiwi, very popular, is made from the using group more of fruit, less than water and a little less than stabilizer.
"Only a stable mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice," asserts Luciano.
The manufacture of the ice is a calculation exercise: if one uses purée of fishing with a lot of sugar, it is necessary that the quantity of sugar is reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for the ice to the lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape moût).
Fortunately, the pictures facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of the ice no longer necessitates, as formerly, as much of physical intervention.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of the basic mass that helps.
It exists equally a device in which one beats simultaneously the mixture of available ice to render smooth it and brought back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automation, of light breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo gets covered with purée of fruit of the head to the feet and, thus, splashes its study friends when the check of the colossal bowl mixer escapes him.
The master Luciano is opinion that a "similar incident risks producing itself at the time of every course: it is only a time question."
The inspectors in an ambiguous position
According to certain sources, the industry that tests the culture of the genetically modified plants infiltrated European Authority of security of the foods.
This accusation now is formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech that is considered as an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"That rings as a theory of the conspiracy, but we well informed ourselves," declared Wednesday to Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Certain information mention what the president of the group of experts Efsa for the genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as of other experts Efsa are under contract with the group of pressure Ilsi.
The latter is financed by the groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Gape.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated in a manner determining to the elaboration of the prescriptions of essay of the Efsa for the genetically modified plants and is located, therefore, clearly in a position of conflict of interests, according to the critics formulated by Mr. Then.
The elaborated prescriptions correspond literally, by indentations, to the taken position of the group of pressure Ilsi and carry thus the brand of the industry that, to the bottom, would be checked by installed authorities to Parme in Italy.
It already is the second time that Testbiotech denounces an interest conflict.
A person in charge of high row of the Efsa recently rejoined without condition or without transitional period it Swiss food processing group Syngenta. This fact, She changed camp.
There is little time, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the loaded European Union of the check and the industrial lobby, which awakened the suspicions just as well of the German federal Agency for the environment as of the European representatives.
Nevertheless, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that one exploits all the reliable data, including the one of the industry as long as they are of a good professional quality.
One does not forbid to the experts working for the account of the Efsa to tie up of the contacts with this activity sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that it works for the international institute for the sciences of life (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based to the United States.
This organism considers itself as a neuter forum grouping together the experts that belong, among others, to the domain of the sciences, industry and political one in order to evaluate the risks of the biotechnology without being to the balance of a lobby.
In this matter, the independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the Fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without any essay of nutrition with the animals and that one has done not test the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We wish which knowledges are, for example, the incidences of the genetically modified corn cause to the field" asserts Mr. Then.
The current practice consist in to test only the isolated proteins and not genetically modified THE very plant, which does not allow obtaining from the reliable results.
"If one not research the risks, how one can then to discover them?" wonders Mr. Then on an accusatory tone.
This is also the point of view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist carries out research since 1994 in the domain of the genetic one and works currently to the school polytechnique of Zurich.
In this region as to the United States, and henceforth also in Europe, the sector of the industry tries more and more to influence or to discredit the critical scientists.
This is the reason why, it exists scarcely again of the researchers that are not linked to corporations.
Opinion of the businesses, the studies criticize would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck asserts that "the industry checks the research on the security."
The rock track
Uli Gsell itself is obtained some, altogether 400 kilos about.
Monday afternoon, she was located in front of the train station of Stuttgart with his tube to the back.
There was manif.
It snowed.
The history is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun demolishing a big party of the wing north.
The world of Stuttgart no longer was the the same: Several thousands of people showed against the project S21, the transformation of the central train station of Stuttgart in an underground train station that will cost several billions.
A big party of the wing was ruin some when the demonstrations led to the stop of the works of construction.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the limestone coquillier) of Crailsheim, a paved one to stretch and crude poorly constructs between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years living to Ostfildern.
It is obtained himself some fragments.
"These rocks are relics."
"They must not disappear."
It declares with enthusiasm: "A rock modest and simple inexpensive and earthly."
It asserting that while cutting it to the saw, it felt the odor of the smoke of cigarette.
It knows not again what it will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The tracks of the rocks of Stuttgart take to a former deposit of munitions of the French army in a situated forest close to Tubingue, where Manual Rongen edified his rock empire.
This man of 44 years done the commerce of old rocks.
It bought all the rocks coming from the demolition arising to Stuttgart.
"This would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the disposal" it declares in his situated office in a hut, that was formerly a post on duty.
It relates that it was the object of insults and of threats when in September the newspapers retrieved that it had buys the remainder of the wing north to the demolition business.
But it negotiated during entire days with the opponents of the project S21.
And it explained them that it could not do anything the all to oppose itself to the demolition.
And if she takes place, then the thing more reasonable would be to continue to use the rocks.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 afterward took the one of the parallélépipède of weighing rock in average 80 kilos of which the value is understood between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Certain the guard as to remember in while hoping to be equally able to return it at the time of a reconstruction.
Rongen had obtained 500 tons, 25 complete loads of a truck.
About the half is located again piled up in the forest, the remainder being since a long time sold.
Garden owners, gardeners landscape artists, Special.
They came from everywhere and took all that could enter into the trunk and the trailers.
These rocks of scandal of Stuttgart transformed themselves since a long time in "Mäuerle" or in limitations of the flat bands of grasses.
"To the fact, this rock is nothing of special one" says Mr. Rongen.
"Had not been this composing political."
It enters into his car any land, does the turn of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
It did the studies of right that it abandoned. Later, it undertook to study the biology before to be very interested in data processing and to become finally a quarryman.
And a rock amateur.
It stocks 40000 tons.
It stores up treasures themselves everywhere in Germany.
IT asserts that it is the biggest merchant of the old rocks.
It curbs himself.
Sculptured rocks of sand with art are borne on the snow.
"Formerly, They were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke to Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, it asserts with enthusiasm.
"My favorite rock."
It takes the way that climbs through the forest.
It shows a pile of the finger: Rock of red sand, beforehand, left the train station of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertin."
The parallélépipède did formerly left the tribune of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the rocks and histories, the travertin of originating Cannstatt of the police headquarters, slubs it originating reddish of the holy cathedral Blasien, the originating tuf of the hospital of Heilbronn.
Which work, Which efforts, which sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that formerly the rocks were sculptured to the hand and moved using simple palans and pulled carts by beef, it becomes completely respectful.
"This would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in piece."
It did not become rich, again less richissime.
But this quarryman employs today 14 people. In addition, tailors of rocks, a sculptor, a forgeron, a souffleur of glass and a gardener installed themselves in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," asserts the loss recycleur.
Soon, it must go to Cologne.
Over there also, there are rocks to save.
Fight talents to conquer the potential tops
The known counter a lively crowd.
16 students jostle themselves to buy buns to the salmon, sauce tomato and blancmanges.
The technical university of the Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the students in design and mechanical genius to a workshop.
In the framework of a sort of competition of ideas, they must speak trade on the subject of the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, while passing, know the firm Volkswagen.
These days, number of businesses do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to discover better brains and to be involved itself, as Volkswagen, in a cooperation multiforme with the universities.
Their mission: Recruit the graduates the done more endow with as much as possible in the amphitheaters before than the latter arrive on the job market and only they are not wooed by the others.
And since the universities do not publish declarations concerning the performances of their students, one tries to spot the exceptional talents in the framework of the projects practice and to make loyal them.
To the second day of the organized workshop to the technical university of the Brauschweig it group automobile cajoles the talents.
A young lady of the service of personnel divides the pens, candies and cards consisting of the logo of Volkswagen.
She talks about the calendar of professional trainings and studying jobs to the young talents; she shows them the ways to attain the pregnant one group.
It is Nico Saddles technical university of the Braunschweig that is responsible of the engaged project with Volkswagen.
For him, there exist the reciprocal advantages for the two parties: "The students come into contact with this industrial sector and win in experience."
"As for the group Volkswagen, it can know the students, look at of more near the serious candidates and appreciate those that are taken into account as assistant."
According to Mr. saddles, such a cooperation is unusual.
What there is again is the offensive with which one looks for to attract itself the students.
"Formerly, the accent was put rather on the professional project," asserts Mr. Saddles.
The fight for the conquest of the new graduates will become well harsher.
In several sectors, the businesses cannot recruit their assistants anymore while carrying out one sort on a stream of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and especially to woo the highly qualified manpower.
It is especially The graduates coming from the engineering systems that are located in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of the German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 posts of engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the anticipations of the VDI, the emptiness relating to the posts of engineer will enlarge himself again.
Novel Dykta goes hunting to the talents for the account of KPMG, audit office, of expertise accountant and of counsel.
It organizes costly events aiming at the recruitment of the talents, as for example chases it cruise kpmg-race, a type of rally paper where the competitors must find their way using the coordinated GPS.
The business will thus send eight promising students next years so that they traverse of this manner the United States.
The participants accessorily can visit the affiliates of KPMG and know the business.
The one that there must participate makes a decision in advance after two procedures of selection.
Only the cream of the cream of the numerous candidates will fly away themselves for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the used means for the quest of the potential tops in the universities are more and more important.
"We want to emerge from the batch thanks to the race cruise."
"For us, a simple cruise was too few thing"
For the talent hunter that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems there to be.
"Until today, we remained in contact with all the people having taken a stand last year to a similar action."
"Certain of them are about to to finish their studies and wish to address soon their ask our business." it asserts.
Outside of the direct amadouement carried out in the campus, the small and average businesses proceed from completely classical manner while participating in the fail professional where they deliver themselves to the hunt to the brains.
"We try to attain the graduates while participating in the professional parlors."
"For example, to the parlor of the solar technologies," indicates Mrs Sitha Stübe, director of human resources with Solarworld, manufacturer of panels photovoltaïques.
This installed business to Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe has knowledge of the problematic one linked to the relief.
Currently, 35 posts are put to the competition on the site of the business.
"In this moment, it is very difficult to provide with the vacant posts."
"That costs a lot and takes a lot of times," does it assure?
Another mean to establish the contact consist in to pass by the college professors.
Solarworld established a cooperation with different establishments of higher education, for example, the university of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the possibility to carry out professional trainings or to write his project of end of study at our place."
Advertising costly campaigns are announced with the specialists of the solar one.
It is for that that the business tries to do his advertising while putting in epigraph of other qualities: personalized mood, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a big group cannot do that," supports Mrs Stübe, boss of the personnel.
There is a long time that not held money more the principal role in the job research.
The flexible hours of work, the guard of children or of good possibilities of promotion constitute the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the institute Great Places à Work, Solarworld occupies the 55E places among the 100 better employers of Germany.
The institute constitutes a picture of annual honor of the German employers.
To this effect, it questions the assistants on their degree of satisfaction in comparison with their work and to his context while looking at the conditions frameworks of the employees.
The boss of the personal Mrs Stübe hopes that this placement will allow elevating the picture of the corporation with the job petitioners.
"I think that the candidates themselves put back some especially to the external evaluations in the matter of a potential employer," she declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher To Employ Branding Akademie, DEBA) counsels the businesses that wish to build themselves a good reputation as employer while applying a strategy in the long term.
It counsels to its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means before all to take internal measures.
"The better means for an employer to go attractive is to go through its own assistants," it asserts.
That is called, according to used gibberish in the sector, the strategy of internal picture, that is to say the creation of the picture of brand of the employer within his own workforce.
"The assistants satisfy form the better messengers."
When one treats well its employees and that they identify themselves with the business, they do all alone the advertising of their employer with their friends and knowledge.
"This is as if one played in an orchestra," declares Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake to the new oil drillings
It will exist not again drillings of oil in the gulf of the Mexico to the wide one coast of the Florida, State of the southeast of the United States, during the course of the years to come.
The government of Washington pronounced a ban An equivalent ban and, thus, definitively canceled its initial plans.
Even to the wide one coast Atlantic, again drillings remain for the moment forbidden.
The secretary to the Interior Ken Salazar did this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, plateforme of drilling "Deepwater Horizon" that is at the strict origin of this ban. This one must remain in force at least for the five next years.
Facing this accident that to cost the life to eleven employees and drives to the biggest environmental catastrophe of the United States, the President Barack Obama, subjected to the pressure of the opposition and of this sector of activity, had indicated that it was disposed to authorize the realization again drillings in the eastern party of the gulf of Mexico.
The favoring solution want thus to reduce the dependance of the United States with respect to the foreign countries with regards to the supplying in oil.
The knowledge question that carries the responsibility of the devastating black tide in the golf is not, until this day, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, that is confronted to the ask compensation of several billions, is located to the center of the accusations.
An investigation commission created by Obama must present its conclusions running December.
In October, the secretary to the Interior Ken Salazar had got up the freeze of decreed drilling after the explosion of the plateforme.
Following this decision, different oil groups as soon as had presented of the ask relating to again projects of drilling.
With measures of stricter checks and of the record harsher security, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The authority of competent check, that discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, does currently the object of reform in depth.
Simultaneously, Mr. Obama announced would eliminate them the lucrative fiscal niches of the gas and groups oil.
The actors of this sector of activity put henceforth publicly in guard against the Fact that the debit of nutrition in the gulf would be clearly weaker than this is not the case so far.
"The objective of the government is to put a brake to the quick growth of the sector of the gas and oil" according to the current result of a poll realized in the sector by the office of audit BDO, before the ban of pronounced drilling Wednesday.
Besides, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
The consented investments in again projects of support were put back until new order, to the detriment of the growth.
The country Ogoni is at dry
The water that flows in the rivers is oiled brown; she releases a similar odor to the one that exists in the gasoline station: Because of an escape, billion liters of crude oil destroyed the country Ogoni to the Nigeria.
The men live flight, of corruption and refining of the oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do not exhaust you," launches the campaigning ecologist to the journalists to calm them: "You today again enough mud of oil in front of the water lens."
The Nigerian one of 37 years attempted to photograph a young one sunk in muddy water to the chest, as well as the led fatty that the surrounds: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water brightness to the color of l'arc-en-ciel.
One cannot notice itself that the basement is crammed brown tablecloths of crude oil.
On the shore of the river bodo-jetty, Esther Badom relates that, formerly, she collected shrimp by entire buckets here.
But meanwhile waters calm completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge quantity of oil gushed of an oil pipeline having exploded in the immense marsh.
The fishermen living the small city neighbors Bodo henceforth must row for six hours to attain waters poissonneuses: The country Ogoni situated to the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered as the one of the regions the done more pollute to the world.
All the range of the ravagings jumps to the eyes when one traverses the crossed marshes of mangrove by water course.
Instead of a clear water, the boat to motor splits a water chestnut cradingue. Whoever there dives his hand withdraws it all covered one with oil.
The roots of small ones of the emerging mangrove of the ground as sticks of réglisse. The isolated palm trees sadly leave to hang their palms.
One looks for in vain the clouds of birds, as one in encounter habitually in the humid zones: Dice that the motor outboard motor stops itself, a ghostly silence cuts down itself on this formerly paradise that resembles a station service by the odor that it releases.
"What happens here is war against the environment" declares Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in the matter of health."
The comparison of the wars is done.
The region where live the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged since tens of years: More than 60 years ago, the searching first Europeans penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the years 1980 by the writer Ken saro-wiwa. this one was executed later. In 1993, the group Shell had to interrupt its production activities in this region because these had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today again, the return to the country Ogoni is forbidden to this corporation: While more than 2 million barrel of now black daily are pumped thanks to more than 5000 well of drilling and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines as a whole of the region of the Delta, three times big as Switzerland, the petroleum fields of the country Ogoni are untapped, for the position there is too unstable for this oil group.
All the some cents meters stand up in the water of the tréteaux in steel as of strange sculptures: One designates very affectionately "trees of Christmas" the heads of holes of drilling.
They have until 50 years, the most are gnawed by the corrosion to the indicator.
Akpobari considers that a head of drilling of this nature breaks time in time in piece, for a constant wave of crude oil flows in water.
According to the estimations of the experts, more than two billion liters poured themselves on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the quantity of equivalent oil to the one that flowed itself in the sea at the time of the accident of the great-oil one "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago to the wide one Alaska, one of the bigger environmental catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Who must carry the responsibility of persistent environmental pollution? the response to this question divides the actors.
For the group Shell, the sabotage and the siphonage of the oil pipelines are responsible more than 90 percent of pollution. The environnementalistes for their party consider the explosions of the heads of drilling and the perforated oil pipelines as the principal causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner accused the group Shell to apply to the Nigeria of the norms of security essentially less strict than everywhere else in the world: Only the rate of failures of drivings is "again well more student than alleures."
Certain emerging forms of the mangroves to a place that, seen by far, resembles an abandoned workshop, a lot of cambouis and installed to the free air: They are completely nude and covered cambouis to the neck.
A fire sparkles under the one of the numerous barrels that sometimes linked up to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be marked: a small clandestine refinery.
One let the crude oil heat in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team boss.
Previously, the gasoline penetrates in a receptacle while going through pipes, next, to the extremity of the driving of the drops of kerosene fall and one obtains finally of the Diesel.
This is as well as Michael and its four assistants produce daily four fûts of Diesel of 300 liters: "That retrieves us 34 000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta take advantage of the chronic scarcity of fuel in the biggest productive country of oil in black Africa.
The Nigeria disposes only of a single refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell to a price less dear than the one ridiculously low of scarcely 40 pennies of Euro a liter of Diesel: For they acquièrent free their first matter.
This one is offered by the "protective" that put the network of the oil pipelines in breakthrough everywhere through the country of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses of this manner at least 16 millions of liters of crude oil as a whole of the Delta of Niger.
Only a small completely insignificant party of the first provisionally stored matter illegally is purified: The networks of the organized crime that count equally among its members of the politicians and of military officers of high row, load the party of the lion in tankers and liquidate it on the world-wide market.
The campaigning Akpobari considers that the debate concerning the knowledge question if it is necessary to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather the subversive activities to the population or to the method of lax production is purely academic.
"If the oil corporations were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen so deeply were not destroyed, it would not have or sabotage, or flight and illegal refineries."
But, Meanwhile, the relations of the Ogoni especially with respect to Shell so damaged itself that it no longer was question than of the collection of the group. "Maybe that the operators having other nationalities, as the Chinese, will reveal themselves better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is big time that you left" announces the sturdy worker of the oil.
"The soldiers can appear at any moment."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by special unities of the armed forces, they will not do of course the object of an arrest, but all to the more they will offer them jars-of-wine.
Even the especially native soldiers of the north of the country hear to take advantage as all the Nigerian ones of the first matter.
"To any view point, this rotten thing dropped our well low country," regrets Akpori.
The investigators discover defects of construction in the reactors of l'A380
L'A380 suffers obviously of a big problem of security.
While examining a device that carried out an urgency landing, the investigators discovered a possible defect of construction that can drive to "disastrous failure of the reactor."
The airline company Qantas wants now to carry complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the belonging Airbus to the company Quantas visibly had had so far more luck: During the investigation that she took, Australian authority loaded aerial security noted that the reactors of certain devices A380 presented a serious problem of security, and she warns against a possible defect of construction.
This failure potentielle could induce of engrave consequences: She can provoke creeks of fatigue and escapes at the level of the raccordement of the driving of oil, one indicates in a taken one of published position this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
She could have driven to a "disastrous failure of the reactors."
Are concerned the made reactors rolls-royce and equipping 20 aircraft of the series A380.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, that had to land urgency November 4 to Singapore, figures among these.
The Australian airline company henceforth engaged judicial pursuits against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She deposited a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court of which sits it is located to Sydney. This gait gives him the possibility to take others measure lawful against the corporation.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, declared that his company would claim from damageses comparatively to the arisen incident at the beginning of November.
Pieces detached themselves and the carrying surface was damaged during the fire of the motor.
According to rolls-royce, it is the oil inflammation that is at the origin of damages.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now must be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that of other tests relating to the security will be realized on the superjumbos that are equally equipped reactors in questions.
The security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with rolls-royce, indicated the Spokesperson of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered as sufficiently important to inform all the concerned parties.
After the landing of urgency of his airplane, the airline company Quantas had immobilized to the ground all his floats d'A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of one A380.
The airplane to two floors is the biggest airplane of line to the world.
The snow fall on the whole territory provokes a chaos in the transportations
Germany any cover of white one: In a night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos reigns on all the roads, the trains and the airplanes are immobilized.
At least three people are dead in accidents of circulation.
The winter done to shiver Germany: By icy temperatures, almost the very republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which drives to the chaos in many localities.
To the north and to the east, the snow cover attains 15 centimeters by places.
The circulation strongly is restricted on several expressways and on many roads.
On the national one A7 to Flensburg, the personnel of the service of winter worked in a permanent way, but they were not able to come to end of the snow that did not stop accumulating itself.
In addition, of violent flurries swept the coast of the sea Baltic.
The federal Office loaded maritime navigation and hydrography (DSH) expects this tidal waves take place known the coast Baltic of the schleswig-holstein with levels of water being able to attain 1.2 m above the normal one.
The heaps of snow on the expressways and on the federal roads induced of engrave problems in Saxe.
This is the reason why the central of agile of bad weather Meteomedia announced the level of purple alarm was announced in Saxon Switzerland: indeed, this is the the highest level.
By places, it there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds.
Several trucks and cars there remained jammed the night.
Even in the saxe-anhalt land, police authorities announced of engrave disruptions on the roads.
On the expressway A2, the snow and the wind induced an interruption of the circulation and caused of the corks.
In Thuringe, the snow falls touched the expressways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, of engrave disruptions of the rail traffic took place in Saxe, saxe-anhalt, Thuringe and to the north of the Bavière.
The principal problems are: the snow on the iron ways, the fallen trees on the steel-tipped ways, the catenaries or the destroyed aiguilles.
In Saxe, one had to interrupt the interregional transportation leipzig-nuremberg.
To Sallfeld, in Thuringe, a train ICE bound for Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The firefighters and the paramedical ones had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in covers, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
The snow Falls induced many flight cancellations in the principal airports of Germany.
According to a spokesperson of the standard one and information on the flights, some cancellations already are announced to Munich.
A spokesperson of Fraport indicates that 40 flights already were canceled to Frankfurt on the Hand.
The winter service there assures a permanent service.
It is true that the jammed passengers to the airport no longer are numerous, despite that scarcely 400 beds there are put at their disposal.
Accidents are themselves products Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
Evenings to Ostholstein, a truck driver died at the time of a collision with a train to a passage to level.
The driver of the train lightly was injured.
Because of the put to bed snow present on the roads, a similar accident produced itself not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught to a passage to level because the vehicle there was immobilized.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train, this is the reason why the going road of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a woman of 30 years is dead when his car did barrel on a slick roadway to Aschaffenburg.
Nevertheless, the meteorologists announce a good new one: The snow will be of course always soft and poudreuse, but she will whirl in case of light flurries.
But, the wind will weaken itself.
Only the sea Baltic will be afflicted by of violent and winds quick.
It does nevertheless very cold, until less 15 degrees by places.
The Deutsche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin turns.
The deutsche Bank looks for to separate itself of his emblem: According to of retrieved the news by newspapers, this financial institution looks for buyers for its two buildings of situated offices to his seat of Frankfurt.
This building could retrieve until 500 million Euros.
The Deutsche Bank comes all just one to embellish the seat of the group: The twin turns situated in the matter Neighborhood were modernized; while awaiting, the bankers had to return in their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group tries obviously recover the costs of renovations and it looks for a buyer for its two buildings, as the manuscript the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland," quoting a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons of the foreseen sale.
It declared "we verify if it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them again in housing later."
This is as well as the biggest financial establishment of Germany already yielded his seat, little time after.
It is only in the middle of the year 2007 that the bank had obtained the twin turns for an amount of 272 million Euros with the possessors of funds own. She next had rehabilitated them.
The transformations aiming at the energetic optimizations swallowed up, according to certain indications, about 200 million Euros.
A sale would retrieve evidently a lot of monies to the bank.
According to of the news furnished by the newspaper, the experts of this sector of activity estimate the value of the turns, rechristened meanwhile "green Turns," to about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, one knows not currently if the buildings will be again sold to a funds belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry the minors that perisies.
In New Zealand, more than 10.000 people had a thought for the minors bury that were declared dead following several explosions arising in an expression.
One again had not been able to climb back up the bodies because the security position of the stricken well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion produced itself to Pike To Fasten Mines close to the city of Greymouth.
29 minors of which the age is situated between 17 and 62 years had been buried under earth.
A probe had been introduced in the stricken well, but one had not discovered any track of survivors.
Because of the strong concentration of toxic gasses and other explosions that followed, no relief team was able descend in the expression for reasons of security.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and the administration had considered that the minors no longer had no luck to survive.
So far the bodies did not can by to be climbed back up.
Today, parents and friends organized a party to the memory of the deaths.
Thousands of people had mustered themselves under a bursting sun to Greymouth to the south of the newzealander island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors bury, one installed 29 tables on which these one could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photos and personal effects, among which these the clothing and the surfing boards, there had equally their place.
The flags were put in Bern in front of all the public structures of the country.
The newzealander Prime Minister John Key declared to the participants to the commemorative party that New Zealand nourished the hope that the minors would date back to the surface.
"But they never returned to the house."
Mr. Lawrie Drew of which the son Zen was buried in the pits declared that it cannot resign itself to accept the death of his son as long as it will not have seen its remainders.
Besides the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative party.
Minors of south african origin and British equally buried at the time of the first explosion of November 19.
The first-aid workers began extinguishing a fire inside the expression of coal of the island of the South of the New Zélande.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to the journalists that when the explosive masses of gas are moved, the burning temperatures inside the expression begin lowering.
Goes in hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising," epic of the fighter.
To which public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn it well was able to think while turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only an eye is done prisoner; it liberates himself of his butcher and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates its opponents after one another. That seems ideal for the young masculine spectators to the bloody research of an action, exactly because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When it is bad mood, it pulls out the intestines of its enemies without awaiting that these are dead.
Of another side, until the end film, the one-eyed one does not say any word on his true name. Even the other personages leave to escape, all to the more, to the detour of one or two sentences some horrendous cries of mortal agony.
Otherwise, one says nothing and one feasts in the mountainous unbelievably beautiful landscape of Scotland that constitutes the setting of the universe of the Viking ones, there are about thousand years.
It would be ideal more the film directors matures having an interest for existentialism and for the excellent dollies.
When a film aims several groups targets, it is damage that these exclude themselves mutually.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher," his trilogy relating to the trafiquant of wild drug and a lot of trains, as a sort of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refuses himself to bring a little more mood to the dominating current or to introduce a little less than brutality to the movies of art and of essay.
Most of the getting along movie of art must test horror facing the brain that sheds itself all around and to the intestines.
The amateurs of films of action die boredom, when the one-eyed one embarks itself, for reasons that one freely can interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a vessel bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by the calm and the mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be quiet itself.
It is not then astonishing that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only under the format DVD.
It is especially because of the magnificent pictures of the misery that deserved a certain attention, but also because the twitching picture of a film, from time to time, hides itself behind a pretentious and appearance bloody.
It is not a matter no dialogs in this film, or of a coherent action, all is mood, a feverish dream transformed in film.
The spectator there cannot escape.
Refn grants him scarcely a moment of relaxation and cuts him slowly the throat with icy pictures and a gloomy sonorous band, but especially with an elusive hate that gushes heart of the personages.
Only a young blond boy, that is held faithfully alongside the one-eyed one, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than all, the one-eyed hero of which the movable ones are never known, but that returns from the hell at any moment to fight enemies and provisionally allies while transforming itself in warrior, is maybe some sent devil himself.
It represents deterioration, but maybe also, nothing that for those that are, in any case, rot.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, that has for end irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious works of terrassement
The international agency of the atomic energy (AIEA) has access to new indications concerning a nuclear program developed by the Syria.
But this country refuses to adopt a definite position on this subject, again less than to subject to itself the checks of the agency.
In the night of the 5 to September 6 2007 towards midnight, at least four airplanes of hunt F-15 Israeli I'S attacked a mysterious building of cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is situated on the shore of the euphrate; the biggest situated city nearby is located to 30 kilometers: this is Dair have.
His name figures in the documents of the AIEA, for it is a question of the reactor that the Syria constructed it appears with the assistance of the North Korea in rock parallélépipède, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of current electric.
According to a briefing of the services of pieces of information of the United States, the CIA, dating back to end of April 2008, the current reactor, known under the name of the locality neighbors, el-kibar, would be well capable of produce plutonium, that would allow making the atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique is valid since the years 1950.
The CIA showed a video of presentation consisting of of the pictures satellites fuzzy.
Through the computer-assisted organization, she indicated the probable location of every component of the reactor before the destruction of the central one that represents a copy in miniature of the north korean model of the central nuclear power of Yongbyon.
What's more, she presented the photos showing the situated building nearby, indeed the interior of this one.
It seems that the reactor was located on the verge of to be put in service, but it again was not equipped bars of combustibles.
Today, more than three years after Israeli bombardment, one has access to scarcely more information than to the era, and even, with the time the mystery s'épaissit itself more and more.
The former president of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in its memories that before this attack, the CIA was of course sure that the Syria had constructed a reactor to el-kibar, but did not have access to little indices showing this developed nation "an active program of nuclear armament."
Certain agents of piece of information in Europe prefer to be more prudent to this subject and speak only of a "presumed reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
It lacks them the tangible proofs, as well as to the AIEA.
Questioned on the manner in which it assures himself that it has to deal with a nuclear reactor, a diplomat of high row of the United Nations gave only a laconic response in summer while asserting that the AIEA had access to "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrian ones certainly removed with precipitation the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical levelling of the land.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, a team of the experts of the AIEA driven by the former inspector in boss Oli Heinonen, discovered to el-kibar of the tracks of uranium produces by the men.
In addition, the AIEA received thanks to a State member of the pictures of satellites of the commercial contractors showing the moment that followed directly the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than the one presented by the CIA.
Nevertheless, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous backer, maybe Israel, obtained them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the AIEA to establish their authenticity in a manner objectifies.
The Syria always assured that she had never realized a secret atomic program and that she had not constructed reactor.
Damask supports that the found uranium on the site originates weapons used by Israel.
But the AIEA challenged this argument after the analysis of the particles while qualifying it of unlikely one.
Since that time, damask refuses any discussion to this matter, just as on the subject of the satellite pictures.
What's more, the Syria does not allow the inspectors to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-kibar and refusal the access to the rubble of the building destroys by the bomb.
But, same Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then incumbent Prime Minister at the attack, recently declared: "We will never do commentaries to this subject."
It is as well as the investigation relating to this matter leads in length since June 2008 without one succeeding in a result and that she "transforms itself more and more in an engraves problem of credibility of the Agency," as the recognizes a western diplomat of high row in service to the seat of the AIEA to Coming, finally it is a matter of an engraves violation of the treaty of ban of the nuclear weapons.
The AIEA considers that to realize progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have "a functional report" with the presumed reactor.
So far, the inspectors did not do or indicate which installations it is a matter here, or which is their function or which one suspects them to contain.
According to of the news published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the AIEA respectively under the names of Marj have, Masyaf and Iskandariayah equally of the name of the cities neighbors.
The independent institute Institute for Science and International Security (international institute of the sciences and international security) of Washington identified these localities and discover on pictures of satellites a complex close to Masyaf that would be very probably the one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military basis or directly next to this one; this is exactly the reason the Syria refuses the access of the three sites to the inspectors of the AIEA.
To Coming, one asserts that the Syrian ones dread that the inspection group is in fact of the spies that would be sent in the name of the United States by the AIEA in order to spy the military installations.
To true to say, is a piece of information furnished by the American secret agents that attracted the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The AIEA has access to the news, including the photos satellites, indicating that of the vehicles did the shuttles between the three sites and the rock parallélépipède in order to transport substances.
A western diplomat of high row declared to Coming that at least the one of the installations can "to serve to the production of the combustible."
It would not have "any indications concerning sensitive activities," such as the enrichment and the reprocessing of the uranium; processes that are essential to the production of the atomic weapons.
This reactor type works certainly thanks to the non enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, it exists to the harshness of the plausible hypotheses concerning the following basic questions: from which should have come the uranium and where would have one separated later the necessary plutonium to the manufacture of the bomb.
One is unaware of if the rubble, that could hide tracks of big value, were stocked in the three sites.
When the hundreds of loaded trucks of earth will have disappeared, no one will have access to information on the place of storage of the rubble.
For the AIEA, it, is not very probable that the Syria did to examine in 1998 the expression of salt of Al tibni, situated only to some kilometers of el-kibar, on the other side Euphrate, to see if it can suit the storage of the radioactive waste.
While analyzing recently photos taken by satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the AIEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show nevertheless that the Syria undertook works of terrassement in the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the begun AIEA to demand the access to these places.
It is possible that this be a coincidence, but that not contributed to separate the suspicions.
In it is said in the diplomatic circles that the AIEA passed several months to elaborate a plan concerning the inspections to there to carry out. This plan had to allow the Syria to preserve eventual military secrets. Only the invested time shows big which interest the inspectors carry to this matter.
During this time, Damask equally did proud of this suggestion.
A year ago, if the western diplomats to Coming had not mentioned the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be signaled for this matter, asserts, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States that evokes since some months which is known under the name the special inspections, one of the means more powerful of which the atomic Agency disposes to implement its checks.
The director of the AIEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, that had to propose these inspections, of course already talked about" an option to which I am opened in the future," but it hesitates again.
This means consisting of a huge risk: on one hand, it necessitates a majority to the Counsel of the governors of the AIEA and a good number of the 35 countries that there are represented have no craving to see the position to know a climbing.
On the other hand, as this diplomat that gives to réflechir: "Thereto it would serve, if to the end they find nothing"
The love in war time
That goes poorly since that Angelina Pretty did its beginnings in summer as director.
She wrote the scenario itself: this is a love history between a native woman of the Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
One knows nothing of more on the subject of this history, but that suffices to provoke the malaise.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Moslem one, fell in love with his Serbian butcher during the war of Yugoslavia.
The federations of the bosnian women immediately protested. In response, certain foreseen sequences of shooting to Sarajevo were moved in last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is turned in Hungary, but in the phase of post-production, protests always continue in Bosnia.
According to of published the news in a bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of the women victims of war addressed a correspondence to Angelina Pretty by the mediated High commissionership of the united Nations for the refugees (HCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Pretty is itself ambassadress of good will of the HCR.
She is not diplomatic. Some weeks ago already, she proposed to these women to hold an encounter with them in Hungary, but these declined this offer.
"The encounter must be held in Bosnia," asserts Hasecic.
It did not there have histories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Pretty one some says rather long on his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian retrieves that the organization of Hasecic has, afterward, recommended to the high commissionership of the United Nations to withdraw the quality of ambassadress of good will to Angelina Pretty.
But, to the fact, which sort of scenario Pretty did write?
The bosnian ministry of the culture, that received copies of his scenario, granted after some hesitations an authorization of shooting to Sarajevo, but one knows did not why do not next come despite this authorization.
The young author assures itself that she does not follow political objectives with his film, that it is while doing a lot of efforts that she put herself during the course of the yugoslavian conflict. She supports that she wants to put in epigraph the terrible consequences of the war and give the possibility to all the biases express itself.
She remains nevertheless vague on the subject of the content.
This is as well as a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net one. It is rather different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meet again when the woman, a Moslem bosnian, is deported in the camp of Serbian concentration where the man works as custodian.
Which constitutes anyway a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his butcher."
What the film of Pretty one began well before the war, of course.
The pressure that exercises itself on her, thus expresss itself Pretty, is "unfair and base on the news erronnées."
Henceforth, only the fanatics of Hollywood can obtain him peace: While putting illegally this scenario in the Net one, as many other beforehand.
Let's pull!
Tonight, all goes again well with the Irishmen.
No track of dismay.
This is the reason why the local team excessively dominates the come visitors of Sweden, of Finland and United States.
The fans yell joy on bottom of a strong music, they jump for joy with the feet.
Baileyu-pub of Cork in Ireland of the south vibrates because the players launch and succeed dropping the bullets of tennis of table to a distance of three meters in tumblers to beer of the adverse team.
This strange spectacle is called "beer pong." The conqueror pockets 500 Euros more a ticket of airplane allowing him to be going to attend in January to Tired Vegas to the World Championship of beer pong.
Cian To Tan is a calm individual; this subtle game to drink and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors go really not well together.
And nevertheless, despite that, the young man of 26 years looks for to have fun itself, to divert itself question térébrante, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure to play at Tired Vegas does not figure in its projects. In January, it will direct discussions of hiring in New Zélande.
"I test nevertheless a strange feeling" it asserts.
"The natal country is so far and I do not there have any job."
Finally: His friend awaits it already to Auckland, "in less than two, she unhook his wished job as load of project événementiel, maybe a voucher signs" says the young man in smiling.
Because of the dark perspectives to the country, two of the three sisters To Tan attempted their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social attending one, lives to Sydney, his brother Hake occupies now a post of consultant one in data processing to London.
The young ones leave: The position of most of the families that live on the island resemble the one of the to tan.
The experts of the Institute of economical and social research indicate that 100.000 Irishmen will leave soon their country.
They foresee even a number of 200.000 emigrants of here to 2015.
Which represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 millions of inhabitants.
If these anticipations realize themselves, this will be a current of comparable emigration to the one of which Ireland suffered in the years 1980.
After a decade of economical boom during which the Irishmen have enjoys a big ease, sorrow takes henceforth the very place.
The economical crisis touches nevertheless especially the young Irishmen, well formed, that did not know even now that moments of happiness.
The loss of job and the social decline appeared absurd in the years of economical boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three people on ten of less than thirty years are unemployed.
The newspaper Irish Times publishes abundantly the letters of readers composed by of young emigrants, that complain: "In Ireland, all drifts."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but the one that some has the possibilities, leaves and our country thus all a generation."
"The last one to leave extinct the light."
The student in right Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of the Irish students, see to point a darker future because the government does nothing but to throw the powder to the eyes and does not offer any future perspective to the young people.
"They reduce the salaries minimum, but they have no strategy to create again jobs," declares the young studying one of 20 years.
She sees how its friends themselves clingy of a practical not paid training to another.
She declares that are his bigger concerns is to emigrate itself in four years.
"This is a sad and depressing thought."
Nevertheless the men as Stephen McLarnon to try to approach positively this theme.
McLarnon organizes the parlor "WorkingAbroadExpo" that offers a complete support on the theme "to work abroad."
"But the work abroad constitutes for the new ones in the profession an extraordinary occasion to do the first steps in the rungs of the professional hierarchy," asserts the person in charge.
His website shows the photos of the surf in Australia and surfers of the snows to Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not a galère, but that guarantees equally liberty and the pleasure.
Since six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what means to be based elsewhere.
As there was no longer any nothing to do in Ireland for this engineer of 29 years, it works henceforth with 15 Irish colleagues in the sector of the construction e Germany.
A method house goes out exactly earth to Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on of other projects Hannovre or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan visits only rarely his natal country, for it participates in a post of additional work, in order to be able to finish to reimburse the contracted credit to construct his house to the natal country.
"The position already is a not very crazy one," it asserts while crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to construct a house in Ireland where I do not live practically more."
It bursts of an embarrassed laugh while crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential zone with front well cared for gardens, of costly cars of big brands are parked on the access ways.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380.000 Euros, financed to 100 percent by the credit.
"This were moments of madness, without any doubts, money was easy," it asserts.
Is it afraid of to see all to collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects a moment, serves again hot tea and declares: "I do not have any children to maintain and I am young; even all goes crosswise, I can set off again to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations that it hears often the latter times.
"No one must suffer from hunger, our position is nonetheless not as dramatic as this as one lived formerly here in the island," it supports.
"To work during a moment abroad, is what can happen of worse one, maybe is which means that we felt first Irish.
It laughs and speaks next of his father that went in England at the time of the big last economical crisis.
"It was return after there to have passed seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, all simply."
This idea pleases Cian To Tan.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his list of awards, It already counts some years of work to London. This is the reason life not must be so easy in New Zealand for him and for his friend.
But there is again a thing that the worried good the latter days: the party to organize to the occasion of his 27E anniversary to Dublin.
It fears that she cannot transform herself in farewell evening.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says while drinking a long one stuffed of beer.
"A farewell, that appears anyway disturbing."
"Let's call that rather an evening of good-bye, all relaxed one, meeting some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
The support to the democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just as the one to the private business.
The crime became a bigger worry than the unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a big party of the region.
This are there certain of the conclusions of the last poll Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Being given that the poll was realized in a manner uniform since 1995, it follows the attitude changes in the region.
Two secured elements go out again results of the poll of this year, carried out in September and at first of October.
The first one is the mood rather sunny of Latin America.
The second is the crescent stability of the attitudes towards the democracy and its principal institutions.
The support to the democracy increased noticeably in several countries on the pourtour of the Pacific of South America (to see picture 1).
For example to Peru, where the economical growth attained in average 6% per year since 2002, the support to the democracy is passed of a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It equally increased to Mexico, where the economy rectified itself after undergoing a strong decrease of the production the last year.
But only about the half of the replying to Mexico and to Brazil, the two countries the done more populate region, are convinced democrats, which does to lower the regional average (to see picture 2).
Some 44% of the replying region declared themselves satisfy manner of which the democracy of their country worked in the practice; it is a matter of the same figure that the last year but with a strong increase on the 25% in 2001 (graphic 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same that the last year in the two cases; but in strong increase in comparison with 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economical problems in Latin America shook the support to the democracy.
If that held good during the world-wide financial crisis, this certainly is had to the Fact that many of country of America underwent only a brief recession and benefitted from a strong return.
In addition, a network of social security contributed to protect the poor ones.
(The economical Commission of the United Nations for Latin America retrieved this week that the proportion of the living latino-américains in poverty increased only lightly in 2009 and has again lowered this year, to 32%.)
But the mood considerably varies of a country to the other (cf. graphic 4).
The good economical performances of Brazil and the popularity of his president going out, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates itself by a widely divided feeling of progress
What is rarer to Mexico and in central America where the recession was harsher and where the violent crimes worsened themselves.
It is only for the second time since that the poll began that more of reply through Latin America in his together quoted the crime rather than the unemployment as being the problem more important for their country (to see picture 5).
About 31% say that themselves or one of their close one were victim of a criminal act during the flowed year; nevertheless, this figure is in decrease in comparison with the 38% last year and is the more bottom since 1995.
An economical performance sturdier reflects itself in the support increase to the private business and the market economy: about 71% of the replying said regions than the private business is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (cf. graphic 6).
Some 58% consider that the market economy is the only system that will return their developed nation, against 47% the last year.
Does interesting, 62% of the replying to the Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private business); even if their left president, Hugo Chavez, repossesses many private businesses.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the questioned people (against 18% the last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged in comparison with the last year) and the Venezuela (9%, in decrease of 11% since the last year)
But the United States are considered as the country the more influential one by replying them to Mexico and in the biggest party of central America, while the Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in Dominican Republic and to the Nicaragua.
A soiled vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti November 28.
But it was well worse than the outsiders that wanted to help the stricken country and dived in the fear.
One presented cans of ballot and a new ballot, bulletins of dispersed vote in the goutières, devastated polling stations and intimidations
The polling stations opened late evenings.
A lot of Hatïens, including many that were moved after the earthquake of January, wandered in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Certain of them ended up to abandon.
A dozen candidates to the presidential one, of which several favorite presumed ones, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded through the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top ranking official in Haiti of the Organization of the United Nations, considers the event as "an election rather good to several consideration."
Observers of the Organization of the American States and the Community of the Caribbean ones declared cautiously that they not "believed that these irregularities, so serious they are, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In of other terms, the spectacle continues.
Electoral authority, of which opposing them are indebted to Reemerged Préval, president going out unpopular, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results December 7.
The second turn awaited is foreseen for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, a first old lady, withdrew themselves of their initial call for that the vote is declared null.
But there can be problems if Mr. Célestin, that has little or no perceptible support with the voters, is declared by electoral authority as having attained the second toura attains the second turn.
With an epidemic of choléra that does fumes, and more than 1 million survivors to the earthquake that live again in of the stretched, one feared that participation would be.
In the occurence, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented to do it because of disruption.
Close to 250 000 cards of identity, necessary to vote, again were not distributed little time before the election.
The issue is important.
The donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And thus, it is clear, the Haitian ones do it themselves.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, president of the Argentina, benefitted from a wave of sympathy of the public that improved his rate of approval of 20 points, to more than 50%; it is a matter of his higher level since than she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, transform that in a successful country for a second mandate at the time of an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, visibly in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of his defunct husband, predecessor and political former partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, to this matter, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, that continued to manage the political economical one, even after his woman succeeds him as president, was used to elaborate budgets that under estimated the tax revenues, the economical growth and the inflation.
That allowed the first couple to spend additional income to will.
The government of Mrs Fernández lost his majority to the Congress the last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the position sank in the confusion after the death of Mr. Kirchner of a cardiac crisis October 27.
Certain of the dissident members of the movement péroniste in power rallied themselves to Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (where a parliamentary one hit to the face the one of its peers and where of others accused the corruption government), the Congress does not have to approve the budget 2011.
"I will not dispute me," declared the president.
Currently, the budget 2010 will be applied next year, leaving to the president again a bigger room to maneuver to spend to will.
The economy widely overheats: she is likely to grow closely of 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is situated now to 11.1% but many private estimations and the wage claims of the unions, see this figure close of 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, that took its functions in 2003 when the Argentina feared an economical collapse, did a priority of the growth and reduction of poverty, rather than check of the inflation.
It refused to treat with the IMF, it pestered the private and purged sector the INDEC, the office statistics, that proceeded to falsifications of statistics on the official inflation.
Mrs Fernández can at present to moderate these political ones?
She called for talks between the private businesses and the union leaders.
And its said officials that they want to limit the increases of salary next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by world-wide prices students of the agricultural exportations of the Argentina.
But the inflation eroded the thumb blow to the growth after a strong devaluation in 2002.
This is maybe the reason Mrs Fernández shows signs to want to reestablish financial relations of the Argentina towards the remainder of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the bondholders that had refused a previous restructuring forced debt for which the Argentina had not regulated its maturity dates in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems à be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, à which it owes some $6,7 trillions.
The Kirchner always insisted on the Fact that this could not imply a supervision by the IMF, as it is custom.
But the last months, Amado Boudou, the minister of the Economy, announced that the Funds would furnish a "technical assistance" to conceive a new national index of the prices to the consumption; which resembles a prelude of the purification of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in the political one beyond the end of his mandate, now that his husband no longer is at its sides.
If she does it, she needs to win support of the average class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When the Argentinian ones will have returned from their vacation of summer in March, the sympathy wave for her will have gone back.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide to renounce or no, without noise, many politics of his husband.
A half cheer for China
The voters taiwanais oriented themselves towards a sort of a narrower union with the continent.
What that does Taiwan think about his big situated brother on the other side straits?
More than 7.5 million voters presented themselves November 27, is 70% of the admissible people, to elect the mayors and counsel municipal in five urban districts, in the framework of what is considered as a general evaluation of the president, My ying-jeou.
Mr. My is become a substitute itself for the feelings in comparison with the continent, having tied up links of innovative matters, including a pact of free partial exchange, in the biggest reorganization of the relations with properly said China since 1949.
Mr. My successful the test, but all just one.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five city halls, it failed to win the majority of voices.
Instead of that, the progressive Democratic Party (DPP), that leaned towards the independence completes Taiwan, won close to 50% of all the votes for the KMT of 45%.
If that had been a presidential ballot, Mr. My would be in difficulty.
Since that it was elected two years ago, the vote party on his part fell of about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the town councils.
The event unveiled most of the principal subjects of the elections taiwanaises, including trucks to showy country and flags of gathering of mass with girls that danced held some minimal.
An assassination obligatory mysterious attempt was equally perpetrated.
Sean Link, son of Link Chan, honorary president of the KMT, realized an electoral turn for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd pulled on the young Mr. Link, purely through the face, the injured and killing a pass.
Strangely, it was not determined if the marksman wanted to do harm to Mr. Link or regulate a disagreement with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election in leader the suspicion on the DPP and while turning the voters towards the KMT.
Maybe that most winning biggest elections was China.
It was striking to note how much the question on the part continental was itself leaves.
Instead of that, the candidates jousted with the plans for the public lodging and the job creation.
Taiwan habitually enjoys his independence of fact and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its links with the government of Peking.
But this time, the DPP equally abstained from kindle the anti-chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new one taken of conscience according to which the Chinese businesses are essential to the economical survival of Taiwan.
Mr. My, for its part, claimed a confirmation for knowledge if his political relating to China was acceptable for the majority taiwanaise.
One can expect that the government of Peking continues to furnish commercial opportunities, in accordance with his strategy that aims to delude Taiwan, of return to the bercail.
China did not lose time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on the protection of the investments and the medical cooperation.
Of course, she would like also to see a political integration; but start with the beginning.
More better is worth to await for that after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP is itself in any case reinvented.
Two years ago, it went poorly: his former boss, Chen shui-bian, had been sent in prison after accusations of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, it was a provocative one in favor of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderate saw the light of day under the direction of Mrs Tsai and the PDP puts all in work to attract the professionals and the young ones.
Mrs Tsai was greeted as a candidate of the DPP to the presidency, as Knowledge tseng-chang, that served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing his better to show than him also can be involved itself with Peking.
Mrs Tsai announced plans intend for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their discussions can take place without previous conditions.
Mrs Tsai relates to the public taiwanais that his party presents a "dependable alternate" in comparison with the precipitated approach of Mr. My to the subject of China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a published declaration from his cell, it declared that the candidates of the PDP would have obtained from better results if they had insisted on the Fact that Taiwan is a distinct country.
It even ordered to Known Mr., a pragmatic one, of not to covet the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have trouble to choose between its potential candidates.
It is necessary that the KMT done an introspection of oneself.
The evaluations of Mr. My were weak; despite a breathtaking economical growth, the candidates of the KMT did not want to do country with him.
His unpopularity seems to be largely unemployed due and to the expansion of the ditch between rich and poor.
A spokesperson of the said KMT that his office as well as its local antennas will be modified.
The good results of the PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the parallel is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanais see the economical integration with the China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the non-return point already is passed."
Nominations to the Grammy Awards: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "new better artist"

A tolerant microbe the arsenic raises the possibility again types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The strange discovery of a bacteria, that can use the arsenic as the one of its nutritious elements, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and maybe beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that that shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that were considered as essential.
"This organism has a capacity doubles."
"She can developed is with phosphorus, is with arsenic."
"This is the reason why she is very special, even if she is far from being a life form really" foreign," commented on Paul Davies C. W. of the the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the figuring report in the online edition of Thursday of the newspaper Science.
Six major elements a long time were considered as essential for life: carbon, hydrogenates it, the nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and the sulfur.
But the researchers discovered that the bacteria, discovered in the Mono lake, in California, is in a position to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus by the arsenic.
"One wonders what is again possible," declared Ariel Anbar D. of the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important regarding research of the life beyond the Earth because the researchers must be in a position to recognize life, of knowledge this to what life resembles, says Anbar.
The study concentrates on a found microbe on Earth.
Nevertheless, the announcement of a press conference for some to discuss, that did not divulge the details of the find, generated shed speculations on the Internet according to which ones the report could divulge the extraterrestrial discovery of a life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in of other planetary environments, the organisms could be in a position to use other elements to activate the biochemistry and that the body" standard" elements, that we judge absolutely necessary for life, could not be set up," commented on Charles Cockell, professor to the Institute of planetary scientific Research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell did not do left the team of research.
"This work is new for it shows the substitution from one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
This was not a chance discovery.
Felisa wolfe-simon of the Institute of Astrology of the NASA, that directed the study, chose the Mono lake for it is endowed with high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that an exposed microbe to the two substances could be in a position to substitute the one to the other.
"The arsenic is toxic principally because his chemical behavior is really similar to the one of phosphorus."
"Consequently, the organisms have trouble to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different for that it works not exactly as phosphorus; it penetrates to the interior and, in a way, erases the biochemical work of our machine," explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the known bacteria under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing concentrations of arsenic to which one she was able to adapt herself and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the Fact that it can live with the arsenic to the place raises the possibility than a form of life using the arsenic can produce itself naturally, is elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology to the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing never showed that that could walk.
The arsenic was more frequent at first of the existence of the Earth, she says; thus, the researchers emitted the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
That suggests that there could be other manners to form life, not only the manner in which the life on Earth was formed at first," declared Foster, that did not do left the team of research of wolfe-simon.
The research was financed by the NASA, the ministry of the Energy and the national Institute of health.
The two last stolen dogs of exposition were rediscovered to Compton
The two other dogs of exposition on four steering wheels of the exterior one of a motel to Bellflower were rediscovered, the shérifs of the county of Los Angeles have it anoncé Thursday.
The four dogs of exposition - two akitas and two corgis pembroke Welsh - disappeared Tuesday when someone flew the van Chevrolet Express in which they had passed the night to the exterior one of a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others were rediscovered in end of evening Wednesday, declared to Steve Whitmore, the Spokesperson of the department of the shérif of the county of Los Angeles.
"The new good one, it is that the dogs go well," says Whitmore.
"They are in good forms."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and which were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is in course."
"We do not want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to furnish a commentary Thursday.
They were combined Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals of the situated county to Downey.
The assistant ones of the shérif rediscovered the van and the two dogs separately to Compton.
The Akitas - Track, a male of 3 years, and Didi, a female one of 10 months - were safe and sound, announced authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had foreseen to show to regional competitions this week, for the account of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, that live to Redding, are in city this weekend in the framework of the national championat "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they counted to present Track.
The other dogs were awaited to participate in the competitions of other foreseen tests in the days preceding the exposition "AKC/Eukanuba," declared Peek to the Times Wednesday.
The California of the South is the one of the stops of the turn of canine exposition of almost a months of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard verified in the motel.
They remain often in the motels and park their van to the exterior one, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy To Punch, a terrier Parson Russell and a Breton épagneul - that remained with them in the room of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, to the thicker fur, in the van where it would be fresher.
They a little opened the windows, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard signaled the flight of the van at 6 o'clock Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to any person that could drive them to the corgis, provide with an established microchip to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to redden again, the restructuring of MGM no longer awaits than the final green light of the course
After 18 months of turbulences and of uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to recommence to zero.
A federal judge of the bankruptcies of New York, officially rented Thursday the plan "************" by the creditors according to which about 5 billion dollars of the debt would be obliterated; opening the way to the recreation business, being 86 years old existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and the distribution of films and of transmissions of television.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan satisfies the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, more no lawful obstacle exist in front of MGM to put back itself afloat under the guardianship of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary To Bore and Roger Birnbaum, that will become the general directors of what will be a low-fat studio.
The personnel will be brought back to about 320 on 400 at the start.
MGM will emerge not actually of the Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not have concluded an ease of credit of 500 millions of dollars, foreseen to finance the new operations and productions of MGM.
She currently is distributed under license by the investment bank, that bumps itself itself to 75 millions of dollars, and should be financed towards the mi-décembre.
The process of restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 when the bank of investment Moelis & Co. was engaged for counselor the direction on the manner to place its finances being given that she did not have the means to pay the interests rising to 300 millions of dollars per year.
In the month of August, the general director, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in known turnaround for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and of Cooper to resolve financial difficulties of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio took a lot than foreseen one more time.
After several months of discussions, the parties suited, at the end of 2009, to put the corporation in sale.
Nevertheless, the sale to the bids attracted few soumissionnaires among which these none of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 billion more of which the creditors were at the research.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary all to remake while the team of MGM had begun working on a restructuring plan that, after the months of disagreements and internal debate, finally was approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM goes out officially of the bankruptcy in the following weeks, the businesses Moelis and Cooper receive premiums of several millions of dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., that already obtained 1.2 millions of dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 millions of dollars.
The businesses of Cooper, that collected 375 000 $ by months for their services of direction of the business, will receive a "surpasses success" of 4 millions of dollars.
Bore and Birnbaum counts to restart the production of MGM, that has gone out only a single film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films that go out from 2012.
They have equally the intention of co-financer two based films on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a ready distinct one between $ 265 000 000 and $ 275 million to finance his party in these two films, that must be realized by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, that holds about 18% of the debt of MGM, attempted to realize a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where it is the principal shareholder.
Nevertheless, the recent discussions between the two corporations did not result in an agreement.
Toys Tech to maintain your budget gifts in balance
Although the principal candidate for the toy more wonderful of this year is the IPAD, followed, maybe, by the system of video game of Microsoft, Kinect, the two can do an important gap in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bicycles BMX to 99 $ and that a game Kinect costs the same price that 10 ropes to jump classical of appear, or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But there are manners on duty your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national salesmen of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than 80 $.
It is clear that the Law of Moore evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more force; while costing the same price otherwise a little less, comparatively to the last year.
In addition, while there generally is less than new associated toys to websites, two of the done more know of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more of offer.
And the toys to batteries button are in increase, as well as the toys to batteries rechargeables.
Here some recommendations.
(All the prices are from Toys "R" Us, safe if opposite indication.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ for 3 years and more) are toys becomes fluffy some of the size of a pig of India that sing a grade when you to press them on the stomach.
A pressure is equals to a grade, and a second one allows composing a song.
If you to buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you begin supporting, you not more you can stop.
To combine the song to the dance, Dance Mickey Star (fisher-price, 60 $ for 2 years and more) is the better choice.
Inspiring itself technology of Elmo Live of last year, the doll animatronique of 14 thumbs plays the games to role turn as Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovating articulated feet with locking of the wheels.
The children that have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of check of the volume.
If you are a child of the years 80, you will remember Alphie, the one of the first educational computerized toys.
It is return (Hasbro / Playskool, 40 $ for 3 years and more), with a full backpack of cards of game questionnaire conceived to transform a walk by car in a session with a car correction and a file of winnow.
If you are distrusting when your held child your smartphone, here three autonomous alternate ones.
The Mobigo of VTech (60 $, for the 3 to 8 years) is the less dear one and the easiest one to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although the games educate not as efficiently as To Explore it Leapster (70 $, for the 3 to 12 years), it is a matter of the big first revision of the range Leapster, with a more recent screen and more luminous.
No version is compatible with the former cartridges.
The fisher-price iXL (90 $, for the 3 to 7 years) uses a system of type iTunes to offer games and electronic books and is endowed with an entry for card SD that allows posting photos of family.
At last, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for the 8 years and more) is a body of five pads to bigger penalty than a can of match, each possessing his own screen LED.
The objective is to form words while placing the online pads before the time does not flow itself, it is ideal for a competition of impromptu spelling.
More and more, the toys have a sort of online connection.
While basing itself only on their presence in the toy stores, the two bigger ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.

The false bug moves itself quickly on 12 pasta in vibrating silicone in random directions.
It is funny to do a pad labyrinth to see if she can find his way through.
She is equally solid.
The ours withstood a fall of the table of the kitchen and even to a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bring a more soft side to the maintenance of the order in China
Tang Shenbin traversed a place of the city as an urban sergeant to training while inspecting harshly its nervous loads, while emitting to low voice of the orders with a military authority.
It wanted that the feminine members of chengguan - imposing people in charge of the public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary oppression and their leaning for the violence - transmit a certain impression to a body of spectators.
"You hold straight!"
"Are piercing!"
Show them, he says, "to what resemble the pretty girls!"
Four girls having scarcely past the adolescence in white gloves, clothed jackets and of identical pants of color olive, immobilized themselves to the guard-to-you.
Four pairs of black shoes to heel, aligned to the rule.
Four cared ones for perfectly perched hats to the hair summit attached by a scratched knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think that they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with scorn.
"The models are pretty."
More of a government tried to refresh the picture of the urban inspectors of China.
A city demanded that all the exhausted new ones have a diploma of superior study.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the gray green of the uniforms against a blue one supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced to lower them them-eyes by the strong manner:: in 2009, a report signaled that 50 officers had encircled a cart to uncontrollable snack while launching black looks, firmly for a half an hour, until the peddler packs up its matters and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 of inhabitants to Chengdu, chose to do a big operation of picture.
Since 2003, the district completed his street police in urban environment of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, shapes them and their young age.
The idea is to give to the rough-hewn police a more soft side, more feminine.
Unfortunately, same Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to attract the look on this underground urban brigade of China
And for cause, the said critics.
In contrast to the police, these agents are authorized only to let the municipal orders respect in imposing of the fines or of other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media depict the new ones of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat to death an observer after it used his portable telephone to film them in the process of dispersing a protest against an offloads losses.
Last year, a formation manual for the inspectors of Peking, robbed and posted on-line, describes how to overcome efficiently the delinquent ones without emitting blood.
This year to Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a cerebral lesion after a scuffle with five officers.
A video game impregnated of violence, available by online downloading, shows Chinese inspectors formed to the assault of the salesmen of street.
"Chengguan marked the government," deplored the last year Dyed Daily, a national publication, after a énième debate on the tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning."
The skeptical ones say that the approach in is well far.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new feminine exhausted, an editorial, appeared in The Beijing Evening New, wondered if the women had realities try or if they were only a tourist recreation.
The response seems to be a little the two.
The announcement of the district demanded feminine, elderly candidates between 18 à 22 years, to have a beautiful outline and "the five traits of the face in the good order."
They must have a superior size to the average, is of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ thumbs.
The retirement to 26 years is obligatory.
The officers declared that the work was physically too painful for the women of more than 25 years.
"It is their picture that is important," said a certain officer of district to the Rednet.com, an almost governmental website.
"First, the exterior qualities of the candidates will determine if they suit; it is a matter of the size, weight, traits of the face, etc"
Next come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
The women of the Chengguan are as vases to flowers, it said, adding: "What's more to be vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, assistant director of the office of management of the district of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But it noted that the requirements concerning the height were the standard norm in many Chinese offers of job for the two sexes.
Such is the case of the exigeance relating to the order of the traits of the face.
What that means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, the handicapped or disfigured people must not apply.
"We cannot leave a person that drunk or a huncbacked one to come to serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"It would not give a good picture."
Liu Yi, that patrol on the place Baoguang close to a monastery, is of age 22 and has the dapple-gray cheeks with a finely curved mouths.
She does not consider the placement in value of his appearance as being sexist, she at-elle says.
"Do you think that I seem sexy in this uniform?" did she ask of a cynical air.
Xu Yang, his colleague to the 21 years old dimples, says: "Our work is to present the picture of the city."
They do not oppose themselves to what their mandate is limited, they said, because they nourish bigger ambitions of career than of simply to hunt the salesmen in the lanes where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen itinerant merchants that move themselves quickly on foot or to bicycle, while trying to sell the most possible one of buns or of bowls of tofu before taking the escape.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We yourself already said it several times!" , Said Mrs Xu while a salesman fled on foot, abandoning temporarily his bicycle cart to noodles.
The agents describe their functions rather as monotonous that difficult.
"It is almost the same thing every day," declared Huang Jing, 20 years old, that student the marketing after the work.
"Big routine."
The one of the reasons is that the feminine agents do not have the masculine strength of their counterparts to confiscate the several salesmen.
They are able only to threaten to signal the contravening to their superior masculine one.
That stretches to protect them from the sudden public expositions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common in the very China.
This year, hundreds of citizens to Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, offended themselves after the propagation of false rumors according to which these the agents of the chengguan had killed a salesman.
In a night, more than a dozen policemen and agents of the chengguan were injured, 14 vehicles of the government were reversed or put to fire.
Xindu has so far escaped to such a violence.
But the calm hardly is not guaranteed.
Just two pâtés of houses of the calm place Baoguang, where the officers of feminine sex patrolled that morning, more than 50 people mustered themselves on the corner street.
The agents confiscated a bike that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as imposes it for them the regulation.
The owner of the bike screamed to the scandal.
A trial of strength of 15 minutes followed a way before the policemen, to the sinister face, traveled to elbow blows towards their vehicle and left with great speed with the bike and his owner.
Secure Xuedong, 40 years, an attached coordinator to the masculine team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
As the officers of feminine sex, the coordinators - 40 years old men or more - play purely a role of support.
In contrast to they, they are not formed regarding to maintain a waxed picture.
"Sometimes, we verbally fight."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," says Mr. Secure said of a neuter tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public that begins."
The prosecutors will not charge the senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the ministry of Justice got up the criminal accusations reaches on the senator John Ensign, resulting from a matter linked to an assistant of a former country and to its efforts to obtain a work of lobbying for the husband of the woman, have anoncé Wednesday the lawyers of the senator.
The decision puts an end to the lawful threat the does more engrave confronted by Mr. Ensign, the republican of the Nevada that was considered as a possible republican candidate to the presidential one of 2012 until the scandal around his not done matter the national headlines last year and nuisent to his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign declared that it was "very happy" by the decision, result of an investigation of a year.
The senator again could be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the senatorial committee of ethics.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign declared that the ministry of Justice had "informed that the senator Ensign no longer did the object of the investigation and than it did not have the intention to maintain accusation any against him in this matter."
The ministry of Justice abstained from commentary to this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise sort for many exterior lawyers of ethics to the ministry of Justice, according to which these there would be significant proofs indicating that Mr. Ensign would have plotted to violate a federal penal ban on the lobbying.
Interviews, e-mail and of other documents, first communicated in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, that was the one of its assistants, to obtain a work of lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and of his spouse, Cynthia, about the matter of the senator with her.
Mrs Hampton once served by way of trésorière at the time of a country of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political silent partners to find work for Mr. Hampton and, next, it defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to do the lobbying for them; in accordance with the documents and to the interviews.
Being given that Mr. Hampton recently had been an assistant of Mr. Ensign, it was forbidden him for a year by the law to do the lobbying with his former employer or Senate in his body.
The experts in ethics supported that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, that were friends close before the matter, seems in contradiction with the said ban of the turning door of the lobbying.
According to the proof that was rendered public, "it seems there to have a proof surpassed facie of a plot regarding to violate and of substantial violation of the law of the turning door," declared Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington that specializes itself in the defense of customers of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the ministry refused to explain the reasoning having driven to the decision in the matter Ensign, Mr. Brand and of other lawyers in ethics said that the ministry seemed to distrust the political pursuits after a number of steep-sided backs of high level by his section of public integrity, including the taken decisions last year to abandon the pursuits against the former senator Ted Stevens accused of fault Of pursuit.
The federal prosecutors clearly have fear to take the weapons, declared Melanie Sloan, the general director of the citizens for the responsibility and the ethics to Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the matter.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assumes the laws don't apply à them," she added.
Paul Coggins, principal lawyer of Mr. Ensign, declared in an interview that it had received on Mondays a telephone call from a prosecutor of the ministry of Justice and a followed the next day, saying him that the ministry did not look for any accusations against his customer.
The team of lawyers of Mr. Ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to attempt to persuade them that the senator, such as his office reaffirmed it Wednesday in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the lawful arguments that it had done to the floor.
"I am not comfortable to enter into the details of my discussions with the ministry of Justice, safe to say that we think that they took the good decision," it at-il says.
The last months, the federal Commission of the Elections decided to abandon an investigation after a complaint independent by the ethics group, supporting that the payment of 96,000 $ by the parents of Mr. Ensign to the Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission declared that she had not sufficiently proofs to prove that money was all safe a gift.
NV Energy, an important corporation of the Nevada that a long time supported the senator, is a business for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find work of lobbying.
A sharp e-mail in December 2008 showed that, after the business welcomed Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, the principal secretary of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and said him that it "hammered" the ministry of the Interior on a question in litigation.
Mr. Ensign equally participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer of the Nevada, Allegiant Air, and it asked the secretary of the transportation to set up a meeting in the name of the airline company after engaging Mr. Hampton doing the lobbying.
When the new ones of the matter did surface last year, Mr. Ensign was sorry with its voters and resigned of his post of leader to the fourth republican row to the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign declared two weeks ago that it had the intention to covet a third mandate to the Senate.
While announcing that Mr. Ensign no longer was the criminal target of an investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, declared that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow quickly the example of the ministry of Justice and would put an end to his investigation.
The senator Ensign rejoices at to follow his eager work in the name of the people of the Nevada, she says.
The call of Cheshire will point towards Twitter
A half a dozen of them were typing to the far in the rows of the room of audience.
They sent all the minutes of the reports of horrible testimonies through Twitter.
To the end, the defense said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the process of the matter of rape and the attached children to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hagues, that was recognized guilty of the murder of three members of the family Cheshire, in the Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hagues already have to deposit elements to the court that sketch arguments of call, likely to occupy the courts during years.
What is provocative is that the excessive reports on the process - as well as the generalized usage and extensive by the journalists of the Twitter - created a "circus atmosphere," a saturation if shed and instantaneous with inflammatory details that the jury poorly was influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could push the call judges to debate on the knowledge question if the new technologies demand new rules in the audience rooms.
"I did the experience at the time of this process; I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of the new technologies in the audience rooms carries attained to the rights of the person to an equitable process," declared Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hagues, boss lawyer.
The judge of the process, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the returned judgement last week, asserting that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was not any proof according to which the jury would have been animated by the passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The courts of appeals recognize since decades that the media cover of the notorious cases can raise questions on the equity of a process.
In a judgement of 1966 that did dates, the supreme Court of the United States canceled the condemnation of an ostéopathe of Cleveland, the Dr Sam Sheppard, for the assassination of his woman, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere to the process" because of the media.
The crime is considered by certain to have been the inspiration for the transmission of television and the film "The fugitive."
Certain lawyers declared that the call courts seize to review a half century later the condemnation of Mr. Hagues can be curious being given the argument according to which of new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the rooms of audience, unthinkable to the era of the case of the Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the processes of big breadth, declared John J. Donohue III, a professor to the school of Right of Stanford that studied the death penalty to the Connecticut and wrote a report according to which she arbitrarily was applied.
The professor Donohue asserts that certain judges of call could be intrigued by the idea according to which the limitation of the instantaneous communication from the audience rooms could allow the more just process.
The case of Twitter is only one among many others described by the lawyers of Mr. Hagues, likely to be discussed during years; which delays the execution.
The lawyers of the defense assert equally, for example, that Mr. Hagues would have undergone a harm when the judge Blue refused to allow them to put to the test the reactions of the potential jurors while their watch of the gruesome photos of criminal scenes at the time of the selection of the jury.
Certain of the jurors declared having been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and its girls, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years.
The lawyers of the defense assert that they will equally protest the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge unfairly expelled the one of the juror, that had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and that it wrongly put the pressure for a verdict while taking the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not confined.
But their arguments on the effect of the excessive media cover of the process could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, deposited the last months, that the case dominated the media scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates to the post of governor and to the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media did not stop kindling the flames of the emotion of the matter.
"The daily crush of the tweets of the media, movie cameras and journalists in front of the justice palace," wrote the lawyers, "did not resemble anything of what has had been seen beforehand here, to New Haven, and maybe even to the national ladder."
Their accent on the cover of the system Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, certain journalists declared that the affirmation, according to which the instantaneous new ones were more inflammatory than the communiqués put back more slowly, was a view luddiste that would impoverish politics of the Course governing the media cover of the futures process.
But certain lawyers declared that the courts of appeals étaitent often attracted by the arguments according to which ones the social and technological changes an adaptation by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hagues insist on this claim.
In their file, they do a reference to the decision of the supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed the condemnation of the Dr Sheppard because of the media cover of the process and they specified that they would invoke the need of new rules for the new media.
"This matter," they wrote," represents the one of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21E century. "
Can courtesy compare cleavages?
After a country marked by the insults and negativity, a courtesy minimum has burst to Washington this week.
Is it a question of an early warning sign of a true bipartite cooperation towards the before or of an illusory moment before the quick return to the fight partisane in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any breakthrough on the big questions that must be treated during the course of the session of the "lame duck."
But quite obviously, there is at least had a polite discussion on the differences of the two parties as well as on the divided recognition of their responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where every camp wanted to mark points. empty of notation not at all supporter.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the commission on the deficit of the president all also was civilized, despite the political divergences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that narrow interaction of several months created a mutual respect transcending the ideological ditch; but that, nevertheless, divides again the members.
It is scarcely sufficient to declare that a new era of cooperation arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of essay and of placement to the test mutual insurance company regarding to obtain from the signs of cooperation and of compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and patience of the voters for a war partisane renewed.
This is the reason why the meeting of Tuesday and the later commentaries of the participants unveiled a minimum of requirements or of accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a quick change of the climate that existed during the two last years.
What it is a matter of the taxation, of the expenditures, of the health care or the rights, the two parties remain at the miles of distance.
Nevertheless, the election of November had moderated Washington, at least in the current term.
"There is no doubt that the things changed on the tone," declared Pete Wehner, an official of the administration Bush, now alongside the Center of Political ethics and public.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections give rise to passions partisanes and, next, they s'estomptent themselves.
This is well."
On certain questions, notably the one on the order of the day of the session of "lame duck," the republicans and the democrats have other choice only to find a solution.
The fiscal reductions of Bush will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
The two parties want to find a manner of some to preserve a party or the body, in a manner permanent or temporary.
All the same, a compromise is conceivable on the extension of unemployment benefits, this would be only because the republicans cannot allow themselves to give the impression that they are in favor of the reductions of taxes for the rich ones, while refusing the unemployment compensation to the workers without job.
After the meeting of Tuesday to the White House, more of optimism glides on a possible agreement about the evoked questions during the session relating to the "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston, Brookings Institution, warns that a cooperation fructueuse on the problems the more urgent ones of session "blade duck" ménera not necessarily to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112E congress will meet in January.
Instead of that, he says, a disagreement period is probable, indeed inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be it, the psychology in the current term will come back to the one of the confrontations," it said.
Wehner also expressed his widely divided skepticism according to which courtesy would drive to a true cooperation.
"I consider most of which happens between today and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing in comparison with the principal event of 2012, it at-il says.
The reasons some narrowly are linked to the composition of the new republican majority to the Room and to the present voters to the tea that contributed to his creation.
Nevertheless the republican leaders are conscious of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce the public expenditures and to repeal the new law on the health care.
These positions partisanes are here and now clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the commission of the deficit that understand to reform the code of imposition and to increase certain taxes, to push back the age of the retirement and to reduce the expenditures.
The co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose the one of the tasks more difficult to Washington and have, according to themselves, imposed the question of the deficit on the public diary of a manner that cannot be been unaware of.
But they need 14 voices to the commission, composed from 18 members, to emit their plan as an official recommendation, and they had trouble to attain this number.
The biggest resistance exists among the elected officials of the group; which suggests that there is on the fiscal questions, less today, few motives or of will of compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans of the Congress.
The first one will come next year under the form of clashes supporters, being given that the republicans protest Obama regarding budget, of taxes and of health care; for next to be followed by a period of bigger bipartite cooperation.
Which would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It widely is proved that, despite the spirit supporter of the recent election, a majority of the Americans always wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation takes to a dead end, as in 1995, then the two parties attentively will observe the reaction of the public.
The one that will be judged in loss will have to change cape and find compromises.
But this would be nevertheless a point of view optimist.
The spirit supporter and the polarisation are bigger today than they were it in the middle of the years 1990 and it seems there to have a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the republicans of the Congress only it not in had then between the president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
At the same time, the campaigning of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
Considering this reality, exposed courtesy this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will be necessary a lot more efforts from the two parties to find a common ground on the questions that the divide again.
American divulged documents describe Moscow as a havre of the corruption
The check of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and does to pass to the Kremlin a part of the jars-of-wine and money of protection that she collects, signaled the embassy of the United States in Russia in a grade in February.
The police and the federal Service of security realize huge rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of the life to Moscow, it said.
They collect money not only of legitimate businesses but also of criminal organized groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy - which the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the strength" - takes his party while money advances up ladder.
The service grade, that was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The grade is based on sources of which the names were expurgated.
She was composed while Iouri Loujkov was again mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible held of the corruption.
It was dismissed in October by the president Dmitri Medvedev but there is since during had few tracks of cleaning.
Loujkov and his spouse, Elena Batourina, that possesses a business of construction of first plan, always denied the corruption accusations during the years; and it won several processes in slander on these accusations.
In September, it declared what follows to a chain of Russian television, when it was questioned on a suggesting documentary that it was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is to be thrown, this is does not import what."
The Russians believe, to one crushing majority, that their corporation is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the enunciated pieces of information in an embassy report; and it is unheard-of to conceive that this would be at foreign diplomats of a country to do it.
The direct link established between the government of the city of Moscow and the crime drove certain people to name it of "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government worked more as a kleptocratie that a government," according to the grade of the embassy.
"The criminal elements enjoy one" krysha " (used term in the world criminal/the mafia that means literally" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the federal Service of security (FSB), the ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as well as through the very bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a structure to three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the summit."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"At last, the ordinary criminals and the corrupt inspectors are located to the level the more bottom."
"It is a matter of an inefficient system in which the criminal groups fills an emptiness in certain domains where the city does not furnish certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB tosses the money of the biggest businesses and than the police target the small ones.
A source, it said, "explained that the owners of business of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and FSB (rather than groups of the organized crime) for, not only, they have more weapons, more of means and more strength than the criminal groups but they are equally protected by the law. "
"This is the reason asks it protection by the criminal gangs not more also is raised."
The grade signals that, although the collection of money is spread, the protection can be itself unequal; even those that pay sometimes are subjected to an arrest.
Those that pay do not quickly see their matters to close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev evoked several times fights it against the corruption but it admitted the few progress.
The grade of the embassy transmits reports mentioning men that bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against the corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," declared in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It does not do left a political class for it not some exists in Russia."
Without the political one, without opposition, without separation of the strengths, it said, the corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of the corruption would rise, to the ladder of Russia completely, to more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country was classified 154E in a recent poll on the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organization International Transparency (the countries are classified less to the most corrupt one).
The disclosure of the grade of the American embassy, that has was realized only yesterday, late in the evening, hour of Moscow, will stir with certainty of the discontents within the Russian government; although Loujkov can be criticized, in a certain measure, for the failures of Moscow, that could be the occasion for the Kremlin to show that it is resolving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin emitted the hypothesis that the documents of WikiLeaks could be a manufacture and reacted with anger in front of the comments that of the diplomats of the United States had divulged while calling it Batman and while comparing Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem rests on the Fact that it is a matter of our interaction, important factor of the political interior in this country, he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be realized with such a arrogance, such a pressure and, you know it, in opposition to ethics."
The former fighters of the red Khmers obliged to confront the passed
In a room of poorly enlightened class with walls in decrepit concretes of bad quality, the director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng evoked the man that had constructed it, the last boss of the red Khmers, Your Mok.
"Everyone here likes Your Mok."
"It was a good leader; and it was concerned with his people," declared Sreng Kor My, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when it was at the head of the red Khmers, this order remains popular in this isolated bastion of red former Khmers to the northwest of Cambodia where it let hospitals construct, bridges and of other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization live again today.
But this year, 12 years after the red Khmers went to the government, the loyalty of long date at last is questioned to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and of reconciliation allowed the victims to face publicly to the people that had participated in the system.
In June, the government there distributed a manual of high school that, for the first time, sign the history of the red Khmers to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly directed with the United Nations, pronounced his first sentence concerning a former member of the red Khmers, while condemning, to 35 years of prison, the former boss of the sadly famous center of torture of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, more better known under the name of "Duch."
In front of this evolution of the position, anxiety increased with the former fighters of the red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate itself in the Cambodian corporation.
"There are resentments and fear among the red former Khmers but they are powerless to do although it is," declared Chhang Youk, director of the Center of documentation of Cambodia, an independent organism that takes research on the system.
"For them, the life under the red Khmers was glorious but the system became a symbol of the evil."
"The position generates divisions within the families."
Under the reign of the red Khmers to Cambodia, of 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 millions of people were executed or are dead hunger, of disease or of surmenage.
When the Vietnamese ones invaded and reversed the government of Pol Jar United in 1979, the remainder of the system and his army fled towards the border of the Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last one movements goes in December 1998.
While Pol Jar, Dear Nuon and Ieng Sary directed the situated guerrilla of their basis in the mountains of the West of Cambodia and in the jungle, Your Mok prepared one after Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the years 1990, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN drove to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, of big groups of red Khmer fighters began doing defection to the government, peak with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and of Dear Nuon and of Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Jar is dead of cause natural in 1998 and Your Mok, that had held head, was captured by the governmental forces in 1999 in the mountains nearby of Dangrek.
It is dead in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting his process.
Without their benefactors, most of the red khmer former fighters sank in the black misery, town to the rural regions of Cambodia; and numerous are those that remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some elite red khmer officers kept their posts of local leader in exchange for to have deposited the weapons, it is a matter of non qualified farmers to the weak rank and file.
"These people benefitted from very few follow after the capitulation," declared Sok Leang of the Center for justice and the reconciliation that organizes public forums in the whole Cambodia, including to Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked agrarian utopian ideology of the system."
"They were raised in a where done framework of the matters is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, that rejoined the red Khmers as adolescent in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before to install itself in 1998 as poor farmer of rice.
"The life under the red Khmers was good," it said.
"Your Mok nourishes everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must provide for our own needs."
The court of the red Khmers in course equally provoked concerns here.
The court should, at first of next year, start the judgement of Dear Nuon, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and of his spouse, Ieng Thirith, another former minister red khmer.
The mandate of the court is to judge the high leaders and the principal people in charge of the crimes but it did not say if it followed beyond these four cases.
It is necessary for some more to calm the fears to Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned themselves towards Im Chaem, 64 years old, former boss of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the red Khmers in the years 1970.
In 2007, she said to the researchers of the Center of documentation of the Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the barrier of Trapeang Thma, a project where of the thousands of forced workers would have found the death.
Recently, at the time of a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from the work to the situated field close to his house some drinks on pile, on an earth way outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun threw long shadows on dried out grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his passed within the red Khmers.
If the court summoned it, she says, she would refuse of there to go.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," she at-elle says.
"If there are more pursuits, there will be the war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, that did defection of the red Khmers in 1978, equally warned to several returns that an instability would produce itself if the court followed several suspicious ones; although the experts and the historians protest that.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the passed, it at-il says.
But to confront the passed is all that Cambodia must do to forge ahead, says Youk Chhang, center of documentation.
"The reconciliation in khmer terms is reconnecter the pieces broken, he says.
"We must put these pieces together for that we could understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the government on the red Khmers, "A history of the democratic Kampuchea, composed from 75 pages."
It distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as supplement to the manuals of history of the ministry of the Education, conceived for the high schools, that contained less than four pages on the red Khmers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young ones of Anlong Veng know only some details on the red Khmers, in spite of the links of the city to the system.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, student to the high school of Anlong Veng, declared that the new manual helped the students to understand an important party of their history.
But its parents reacted with skepticism when it returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parties of the manual and the court," he says.
"They distrust for they know not exactly how many people the court will follow."
Such a resistance returned the complex and difficult reconciliation process declared Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin having an impact, it at-il says.
Nevertheless, the red Khmers preserve a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a way, invaded by the bad grasses and sprinkled bags in plastic, drives until a rectangle of black suie, cover with a roof of rusty sheet metal.
The body of Pol Jar was burned here on a tire battery after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, salesman of portable telephone in road edge, said that she knew some not a lot on the man that was cremated to this place.
"But it has a big spirit; and many inhabitants there go to pray, she says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she foresaw to walk towards the last place of rest of Pol Jar where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope to bring luck.
Byelorussia accepts renouncing his stock of uranium of military quality
The government of Byelorussia announced Wednesday that it was going to abandon his stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for the nuclear weapons; this décison is in line with itself the surprised framework of a victory of the country of the president Obama to reassure the nuclear matters in the entire world
The agreement was divulged in a joint communiqué published after the secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the minister of the byelorussian foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, outside a summit on the security.
The American government had tried during years to convince the Byelorussia to renounce the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have released the in the spring last horizon.
But the American people in charge declared to the Washington Post that certain classified operations were realized with the Byelorussia during the two last months to eliminate 187 books of the uranium of military quality from a center of research of Byelorussia.
That opened the way to an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 books, according to an official that evoked the condition of the anonymity because of the sensitiveness of the question.
The agreement seems to be the one of the results more important of the Summit of nuclear Security of 47 nations, organized to the initiative of Obama; where Byelorussia was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I really am fascinated by the Fact that they want a seat to the Summit of nuclear Security of 2012 nuclear Summits of security."
"That proves me that this process works," declared Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for the world-wide security, a group of promotion of the nuclear security.
Clinton qualified the agreement "of very significant, important step" realized by Byelorussia.
Obama was involved itself to Prague in April 2009 to reassure all the vulnerable nuclear matters through the world in the four years to come.
Since then, the American government helped six countries to rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Byelorussia would be the seventh one.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Summit on the nuclear security of Obama, the byelorussian president, Alexander Loukachenko, declared that the nation would never renounce to his uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially uranium of military quality and weakly enriched uranium," said then Mr. Loukachenko.
"This is our product... We will not make dirty bombs, and we will not sell it to anybody."
"We will use it to ends of research, this is all."
Byelorussia came close to itself the United States some months ago; nevertheless, while showing interest to succeed in an agreement.
The first one implement to eliminate the uranium of Byelorussia, in October, particularly was complicated for equipment had been lightly irradiated, indicated people in charge.
It was loaded on a special train that traversed more than 1 300 miles until an installation in Russia to be stocked and eliminated, indicated people in charge.
The second operation was finished Monday and was realized by airplane, according to the people in charge.
The American government spent 13 millions of dollars in its efforts, largely to replace the installations of research of the Byelorussia with weakly enriched uranium; misfit for the weapons.
"A coordination and a meticulous organizations were implemented regarding to reinforce confidence"; driving thus to the agreement signed by Clinton, declared Andrew Bieniawski, a person in charge of the department of the specialized energy in the Reduction of the world-wide Threat.
According to the estimations of the Center of Etude of Nonprolifération James Martin, Byelorussia had this year at least 88 books of uranium of military quality, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Byelorussia tries eliminate its here stocks to 2012, according to a joint declaration.
The relations between Byelorussia and the United States are stretched since years, principally because of the length oppression by Loukachenko of the human Rights.
But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While congratulating itself for the progress on these questions of world-wide security, the United States and Byelorussia recognized that an increased respect for the democracy and the human Rights in Byelorussia remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and of its citizens," she declared.
The government did not emit any objection to the flights of the CIA
The government did not emit any objection to the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and of Al Qaeda in direction Guantanamo has breadth of the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the ambassador of the United States to Madrid.
That is shown by the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the Newspaper El País, that add that the first vice president of the Government from this time there, María Teresa Fernández of the Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive is informed for "pouvoir'démontrer that they exercised an adequate vigilance on the airplanes foreigners that crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Counsel of Europe that accused complicity in in contrast to practices the human rights to a dozen countries, among which these Spain, took place a meeting between the North American former ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of the Vega.
The vice president recognized that the report of the Counsel "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted on the Fact that Spain did not have anything to hide.
"Vega underlined that Spain does not have any objection in the matter of the intelligence flights by over Spanish territory."
"They want only to be informed" to avoid that one them "takes to the devoid one," relates Aguirre in a cable.
The tenured one Ministry of External from this time there, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, signaled to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this matter it more possible lower, even if, as her was at the hands of the judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence."
To his turn, in the month of January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the Fact that it was not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of the documents of the National Center of Intelligence (CNI) and ministry of the Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States showed nonetheless their preoccupation for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for declassified information of CNI o of the ministry of the Defense.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between the Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In the month of March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Internal, Alfredo Perisies Rubalcaba, this one commented on him that "even if the Spanish judges are crazily jealous of his independence and will do what they consider adequate," it had given instructions to its assistants "for that they avoid the burning commentaries of a rhetoric, while trying rebaisser the temperature."
The ambassador expresss also his preoccupation for the action of the PAGES in this matter.
"In spite of his general American pro orientation, our experience suggests the Fact that PAGES certainly will take advantage of any indication according to which the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately unknown the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights, even if the one revelations there have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she signals.
The parricide that is passed to confessions complained in network of the" depression" to be mother
The girl talked about the child when it already was dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician one"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she uses as soon as she was small, communicated with a cousin and at least a girlfriend; the two native ones of Noia, the town of the Coruña of which she is native.
The messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, that ABC constructs with the assistance of the testimonies of its parents.
The Galician girl of 30 years had initiated a relation in 1998 with Iván Túñez, industrial.
Their relation lasted a year.

It wanted to know if the baby was at him, but his former one never left it to be done the test of DNA.
One discovered a new other boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected official was Alberto, a jeun man of Lousame, a municipe neighbor.
With him, she cohabitated during a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Islands Baléares to probe the work market, the small one remained with his partner, that even accompanied it a week to Caliper.
But according to the content of its communications, one hears that their romance broke itself, they separated themselves.
In the month of March of 2008 she is located to Minorque, alone, and written: "Alberto is very strange and annoyed for the Fact that I there came to work."

In the month of May, she talks about the return to his town: "This week I leave, but I there will remain only until the 19, for the 20 I must present myself to a work post for not to lose it."
She explains that if all was well, she would have taken his oldest child with her.

In the month of July, there is another post.
When she types it, one supposes that the child, that had arrived to the island the 1 of that months, and it had supposément been murdered the 10, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one hand, but it is not it any another."
"Of a quotation it is with me and this place pleases him a little, but of another it goes to the school almost everyday."
She talks about a movement to Majorca.

The members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PAGES could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase of votes and recorded representatives in the last elections autonomiques, the PAGES Catalan already aimed the general ones for, even if there is progress or not, the perspectives are more positive, for the vote number that this formation obtains in these pear double normally the one that she receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the Catalan popular ones obtained 610,473 votes to the general ones of 2008, while to the autonomiques of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
On Sundays past, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If one maintains this rising tendency, desired of a misappropriation of votes of the PSC and the fidélisation of the electorate of the PAGES, the analysts of this formation calculated the Fact that, if there would be general elections, the PPC can passed of 8 to 12 representatives in the Congress, while CiU would win also four (it has now 10) and PSC would lose some or more or less than 9 representatives (It has 25).
These calculate would note that the Catalan place is basic for PAGES and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a representative - it has three now - while ICV would keep a representative or some would win a.
But if the electoral diary maintains itself, the most next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the pear municipal one, where the popular ones also can be decisive at the end of the socialist domination in the four capitals of province and in their relay at the head of the General Counsel of Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the higher budget - 661 million Euros for 2011-.
So the nationalist ones as the popular ones agree with the Fact that PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain the not majority more the possibility to resort to to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
While taking account of the republican debacle, it would not be eccentric that this formation loses his representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes-.
The PAGES increased his vote number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalist ones are convinced on account of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PAGES before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
To Lérida, the PAGES recorded only a difference of 500 votes in comparison with PSC, of which the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last country, they met again several times.
The popular ones recorded progress also in other important municipes as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PAGES is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and inhales to form lists in a number maximum of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
To party the seven prisoners to Barcelona, in Thailand there were some three
The seven Pakistani and the held nigérien by agents of the General commissionership of Information of the Police of Barcelona formed a cell jihadiste that, directed as early as Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaida, between which these "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Letter), the last one being the author of the attempts of Bombay that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Internal ones gave a big importance to these investigations, to the point to assure itself on account of the fact that with "the operation Kampai" has "summer debility" the device of falsification of Al Qaida to international level and "consequently, his capacity opérative."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which these she was active in Catalonia, was able sharp of the thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaida for that its "fighters" can pass the European borders and of other western countries with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one only the network jihadiste held opérative in Europe, it is for that that in the investigations participated, from the Thai services, of other European police unities, this is the reason why in the territory of the European Union there could be the days following by the similar blows to the one recorded the night on Tuesday past to Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (one held the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the nigérien Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand one unfolded another, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those that directed since Bangkok the established cell in Spain and in of other European countries.
The Catalan network - of which a party was hit in 2009 - principally flew of the tourists the passports that satisfied the conditions marked by the said person "World-wide Islamic Forehead."
Is to be said the documents had to be at name of young elderly men between 25 and 45 years, with a validité of several years and without of the aimed swindled.
The investigators underline that so far one did not find any detail that connects the prisoners in Catalonia with the attempt of Bombay, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receivers of the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless it is necessary to recall the Fact that some days before of that this attempt is committed, of Catalonia one sent through an agency of transfers some thousand of dollars that were "invest" to buy the cards of movable ones that were used after by the integrating of the "commando unit" that killed 106 people.
The Police seized itself of an abundant documentation.
PAGES asks My that it suspends fiscal complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia sánchez-camacho, had the occasion yesterday to expose personally to Artur My its conditions to support his nomination as president of the Generalitat, the same as the the one exposed during the country and that summarize themselves to give priority to the recuperation of the economy and the lack of adventures philo-souverainistes as is economical complicity that the nationalist leader desires to approach to the half of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalan one arrived to the appointment with Artur My with the safety that gives the fact to have obtained 18 representatives to the on Sundays past elections, a number more sufficient to do itself to like, for the candidate of CiU necessitates that at least one of the formations qu will exercise the oppositions abstains in the votation of the nomination.
Of a possible understanding with the PAGES depend the future alliances that the nationalist ones desire to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that My has these days with the remainder of political leaders do themselves in Catalan key.
And in the matter of the president of the PAGES, to support a nomination "it would be necessary to eliminate all the sovereignist and pro-independence speeches, and economical complicity - similar to the one of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader desires to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their wager to let the device slim politics of an administration autonomique very exaggerated and the elimination of the applied tax to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the nomination of My will take care of the party of PC, Jordi Cone and Dolors Montserrat.
My already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - that promised an opposition lasts -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Will Fasten (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric one asserts that the deaths were not had to the "lacks measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The people in charge of the geriatric one The Caritat of Olot (Gérone) offered yesterday a press conference to underline the caused harm to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse that killed at least eleven elderly people of which it was responsible in the meantime that it there worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Salted, presented itself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be the one to be able to exercise the accusation against the person in charge" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the position processuelle of civil people in charge."
And from the social discréditation that the entity can suffer in order not to have detected on time the criminal activities of the nurse of night, the big threat for The Caritat takes now the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime dates back to the August 2009 and that from that day it did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that it ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - patient old geriatric one - for it suspected that in a lot of cases no doctor explored personally the deceaseds but, being given the age and the pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through his director, denied adamantly yesterday this position and mentioned that "the measure lack cannot have been in any moment causes it of what happened."
The lawyer of The Caritat added that "in this matter there is only an index of indiscretion from other any person that is not accused it."
The already baptized person as "the Angel of the Death" acknowledged day before yesterday 11 assassinations and detailed that it committed the first crime August 29 2009 and a months and half later it killed a second grandmother.
In this case it provoked him the death while injecting him a temperate dose of insulin, to difference of the first crime that it had committed with a mix lozenges sedatives.
The director of The Caritat mentioned the Fact that this is complicated to check the access of the personnel of the center to medicines.
The injections of insulin and the sedative cocktail had been the employed mechanism in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the internal ones, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie while saying that it looked for for its first victims a less cruel death or by opposite it burned them to the interior while giving them washes out as it already acknowledged that it did with the three women that it killed in the meantime 12 - October 17.
The Caritat does not believe the declarations of the nurse of night, not more the number of assassinations acknowledged, they do not eliminate the possibility of that the number is bigger and justify their attitude by the different versions than Vila gave in its visits to the Court of First Instance and the logic lack in the change of the manner to kill after committing with success eight assassinations.
It is for that that they declare that they will remain at the disposal of the justice to clarify the reach of the facts.
CEB threatens
The investors have reacts abruptly yesterday to the threat of yesterday of Trichet that warned that "the markets do not have under to estimate our reaction capacity."
The differentials of the peripherals have closed to the force and the actions of the European banks underwent more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we do not have not more under to estimate the capacity of CEB to be mistaken and the Euro has scarcely recorded an incrément, which is a concerned signal.
Which produced itself yesterday is typical of a market liquidates that of the same manner that it collapses, it recovers himself, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay losing the fear.
A months ago, CEB quoted us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the one that in remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the plan of purchase of public debt because of his ineffectiveness and the extraordinary elimination of all the measures of liquidity to term and leaving only limitless access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that one extends the current measures of liquidity "at least to the March" and maintains the sale to the quarterly bids to limitless access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least to the months of June.
We hope that one will continue with the program of purchase of obligations and that one gives even the signal to intensify it.
If they do not accomplish the generated expectatives, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the measures of liquidity, that God helps us!
Just like during their meeting of the months of May in which they asserted that they even had not envisioned the purchase of obligations and they have collapsé walked them, the history could repeat itself tomorrow.
CEB must be believable and persistent.
In the month of May it announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday it said that it already had bought a lot, while provoking a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the bid of treaties to a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasure emitted only 500 million to the 5.28% in comparison with 750 million to the 4.81% of the previous bid.
Even thus, the types in Portugal lowered 30 basic points in the very bend, and reflecting clearly a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland one published the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short one run and 15,000 potential ones and they have a delay to the February to obtain from the private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not to have detected the problem in July with the anxiety essay, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, on Tuesdays next, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of his new budget and it has not again a sufficient support, consequently Ireland remains in an uncertainty home.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of his speech to relax the tension before the next Summit of the Heads of state and of Government December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany desires to interpret Wagner and the remainder the hymn of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the timeliness to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Counsel of the Ministers will approve Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measure to revive the job ring to the heard investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the Fact that the Spanish stock Market underwent the 4,5%, the double that the remainder of the European stock Markets.
To difference of February, the reaction of the Government and Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we benefit from the surprised effect.
Today there is a bid key of an obligation to three years that will be profitted by the effect Trichet, consequently we hope that this one resolves itself with a strong request and helps to dissipate the doubts on our capacity of refinancement.
For required Spain a Plan of Assistance would be a car immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line of which we do not have need, the Treasure more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, the triple one in comparison with March, to very dear types and they cut the access to the markets sine said.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be the one of the spouse of Caesar, "from the being, to appear it."
Courage, we can ourselves some go out!
The president of Eulen will protest the counsel of Vega Sicilia required by its sons
The storm does not stop in the conflict open in the breast of the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will protest, for it considers it "no one of right," the judicial counsel of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of its seven sons in which they will try to emphasize their majority and to seize itself organs of management of the tenured firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and its sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for the check on one hand of the group.
The founder of the bigger holding company of services of matters for the companies does not appear to be disposed to yield in his litigation to be present in the organs of direction of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors it was excluded by five of its seven sons that named themselves administrators in the assembly of the shareholders of January 18 this year of which the dispute is recorded to the Register of the Commerce and Corporations.
The judicial counsel of El Enebro for the next one 16, summoned by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, opened again the can of thunders within the family Álvarez.
The recourse to the judge to set up the assembly is, until the conflict resolves itself, the only mechanism that guaranteed the summoning of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "hopeless recourse of the petitioners its five sons to try, has breadth a quibble processuelle, while cheating clearly the Law and while abusing the right, to validate and to correct the assembly radically no one January 18," according to its official spokespersons.
This line of argument will be the basis for that, once the assembly takes place, is protested while considering that this one is "no one of full right."
The same protagonists, that maintain a discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate summons an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a corporation patrimoniale and tenured of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, active among others, the sons of David Álvarez check the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services solicits nevertheless the usufruit on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This matter is the bottom question that the judge must decide after the audience on the dispute request for which there is not again a signaled date.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on the on time real cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered into the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this sélecte universe of speed was marked by the surprise and by the success.
In a first moment, no one held in account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the rising trajectory of the last seasons, the passed November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skillfulness as pilot of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, not more the capacity of the motor Renault that propels his car, in the world of the Formula 1 one talks about the legend of the" secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put to the hands of Red Bull to transform it in a winning team.
It is a matter in reality of a powerful software of simulation of process that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very removed objectives of the high competition automobilistique.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument was used to create chaines of mounting of the factories fabricantes of everyone, stations of energy, instruments of high precision.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or the process before construct it in a real way, while avoiding thus the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, airplanes of Sukhoi or more famous vehicles utilitaires of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the Fact that the computer usage of this instrument in his Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and to execute "in few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and detected improvements during the races and essays.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams that was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles every season.
In the team of Red Bull work today 180 young professionals of high qualification that, equipped powerful computer equipments analyze and project any modification sort on the racing cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that software PLM is able to analyze and to improve all the elements of the racing cars of Red Bull excepted the motor, that is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
One modifies the materials, the combustible, the aerodynamic and the security elements.
The changes can pass potential reality of the faker to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As unique limitation of this madness of technological improving there is the amount of 40 millions of dollars that every team of Formula 1 can spend as limit every season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull established the factory of high technology to create and to produce its racing cars in a locality to 50 kilometers of London.
This are two buildings where the visits, specially for the journalists, are restricted.
All that happens over there is considered "secret top."
The personnel for this to must counts 580 people, herein two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The héro of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, doubtless, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energetic drinks has puts to the service of his participation in the circuits, there is other hidden protagonists, of which the activity is inestimable and notoriety no one.
The director of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, asserts that five years ago one could assert that the progress of R+D in the case of cars of races brought the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible of the remainder.
Today these percentages changed and the technology represents the 85% of the success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added value.
Nevey had that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by data processing, for "they are gladiators imprévisibles."
HP will install in two years 20 stores own with local distributors
Hewlett-packard (HP) inaugurated in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration with his associate Bridge Reyes.
This will be the first one network of 20 commerces between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational corporation foresees to install in Spain during the two next years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 zones already present in centers multimarque as PC City, Intersection, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as example the modified store situated on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Bridge Reyes, with which that does 30 years that she collaborates.
The North American group prepared a plan to establish 200 points of sale of brand in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open one were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the past week, the one of Barcelona being the third one.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if she acknowledged that Madrid could be the following destination.
The director of HM systems personal assured that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the local support of a distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group counsels and takes care of the conception of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), that in held Europes an identical picture.
Of more, HP covers the formation of the personnel of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a system of frankness and underlined that the exclusive network of commerces claims "to improve the service offer to the customers and to the SMES in the purchase, the assistance, the post-sale and even the packing."
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a program pilots pioneer to world-wide level that résout the possible problems of the computer equipments of HP guaranteed some.
An online service connects with a technical center situated in Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes can resolve us problems that often can take even two days."
"This system specially is conceived for the MPEs and users, for the big companies already contracted services of technical assistance," noticed yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on 'to fly' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimist than of other leaders, the delegated administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank sector, but rejects initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicted the end of the war of the passive one.
Despite that, it foresees a collapse of the margins of the interests, that one will try to compensate partially with incréments of the commissions and price of the credit.
Sabadell awaits to obtain in three a million years special customers, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell found a way to exploit during the three futures years and to be able to survive thus in an economical very complicated environment.
The bank will put in market in 2011 a new guiding plan that will hold a goes labilité of three years.
The objective, from to survive without necessity to resort to to the public subsidies of FROB, is to win a market quotation by the captation of new a million special customers - 700,000 if one deducts those that are able go out of the bank-, his big task to accomplish, for so far this bank had spoiled more the SMES and the corporations than the special customer.
This year it obtained 250,000 special customers and 50,000 corporations.
His market quotation to the special ones is of 3.5%, while to the corporations she surpasses the 10%.
Another bases plan 2011-2013 is the wager on productivity, or which is the same thing, of austerity, with the cost reduction as objective, of which the provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare at present to set up objectives and to do them public, for the financial crisis disturbed all the plans of the world-wide bank sector.
Sabadell, indeed, will finalize this year his guiding plan Optima, establishes it ya is four years old, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the position of the market determined his prolongation for a more exercise.
The customers that leave to escape the savings banks be his principal objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted on the Fact that 2011 will be a year "difficult and transcendental."
The executive, of fact, thinks that the go out of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Of more, in two or three years this will be "very difficult to create posts of work," which is basic for the throw-back of the bank matter, has it insisted.
And even if it thinks that the war of the passive one - that penalizes the margins - reduces itself, the price of the premiums of risk that the banks and cash registers pay for its transmissions to obtain from liquidity move themselves already to the price of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on the credit."
"We did not squeeze the faucet, but the differentials are higher," recognized Guardiola.
Banesto already gave orders to his network to limit the credit in the long term and to increase the price of the differentials - to see CincoDías of the 22 and November 27-.
It acknowledged as as the tendency of the bank sector now "is to increase the commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The guiding plan of Sabadell bases itself on the organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility to realize corporate operations.
This is not in vain that it assures that in Spain "one will solicit bigger dimensions."
"All will budge next year," has it assured.
It asserts that the capital necessities "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter to the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in funds captation in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporal fence of the markets, it diminished importance on account of the fact that some bank ones already predict as a new crisis of liquidity.
It signals that one cannot emit, but on the contrary of what happened in June, one can obtain from the financing in the short one run through of rest which lessens the crisis.
CECA rejects the vague possibility of a second of mergers among the cash registers
The general director of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta,a rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and insisted again on the rapidity with which executes itself the restructuring of the sector.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they reserved themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the general director of the Spanish Confederacy of savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that the biggest party of the mergers was realized, one not can say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica be a second phase, this are adjustments."
"The most was realized completely; it is possible that instead of 17 one goes to 13 or 14, but all the big processes were already realized under the guardianship of the Bank of Spain, that collaborated a lot in this operation also," underlined the leader.
In the declarations during a breakfast of the Association of the Leaders and Executive of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta exposed that the concentration process realizes itself "to the biggest possible speed and we must very be satisfied manner than she realizes herself in the delays than one set up in the past, not now, in the matter plans with the Bank of Spain," has it emphatisé-t-il.
"The passage of 45 cash registers with an average of 28,500 millions of volumes of the active ones to 17 with 75,500 million is a process without equal in the history, while reducing the entity number by 62% for that they are a lot bigger ones to be in accordance with Bâle," has it underlined.
Olavarrieta recognized that" there are an opinion series enough not very happy on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of sérosité and of direction," for "which the Bank of Spain done is to recall that one must respect the delay before the end of the year."
The general director of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the financial system the most severe one of any Europe and "probably" world and it attributed to the people that the question a "lacks knowledge."
The leader mentioned that being given the current economical situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the position of the financial entities and savings banks, a system that began a concentration process "very important" and "goes to possible bigger speed."
It recalled as as the Spanish bank sector itself some is well pulled tests of anxiety as CEB realized in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in the Euro, but it has establishes the conditions for all the Union.
The tensions of the markets provoked a doble response governmental.
On one hand, José Shines Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, that vary fiscal reductions for the SMES, regulation of the private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 Euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of the 30% of the Lotteries of the State.
Of another, the vice president Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president Felipe González, unites itself to the critics of the chancellor Angela Merkel in the matter of his responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How is it necessary to interpret these movements?
It is necessary to mention that the position of Merkel is not an error in his political talkative one.
On the contrary, this is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the Euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, that shocks with the one to maintain the former traditions of most of its partners.
Facing the European resistances, in Germany one begins speculating on the three possible ones gone out of the crisis.
The first one, a strong Euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among others country, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second one, the recuperation of the Mark, even if now that seems science fiction, with a current of very favorable opinion, close to a 50% of the population.
The third one, a new conception of the Euro, in line with the German suggestions for a bigger control macro-économique, budget harshness, fines to the countries that cross them, of possible suspensions of payments of an of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and that does a long time that she defines herself, consequently now there is no room for the excuse.
First, in 2009, when so IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government invented one reforms constitutional to prevent them from 2016.
That was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that one had to do (plans of fiscal harshness and stability of the public finances) and which its European partners, here includes France, practiced.
The second blow of the country centers European was when Merkel with difficulty extended the decision to save Greece.
As early as that moment she was the object of a ferocious critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published were against the rescousse of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expresss again a clear position, while asking reforms it treaties of the Union to do possible the rescousse of a country and to oblige at the same time to the private lenders to bear a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-european, for she precipitated the Irish crisis and the remainder.
But his suggestion, although a little édulcorée, was approved and, the following months, we should attend the process of reforms Union that possible fact these measures from 2013.
Germany traced a red line that she does not think to cross.
And she says us to all that, even if now one must take measures with which ones one is can be not too many agreements, from that date the former functioning of the Euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries that cross the rules harshly will be punished, they can be obliged to declared itself in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will bear also a part of the costs.
Germany signals us that we must follow a harsh way of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in the consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and positive exterior balances.
An alternate one based on the debt and the construction, with huge holes in the payment balance, as the one that presided the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply will not be tolerated.
The placement is clear.
And this would be poorly of not to hear it.
It is not a matter not only to accompany the public deficit to the 3% in 2013.
Which one asks us is a lot harder one.
And what it absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to cheat us ourselves.
I hope that current turbulences leave to arrive towards we a bigger quietness.
And that one knows to seize the timeliness that one gave us, to the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero also heard it of this form and his double declaration (reform them promised after the meeting of the passed Saturday with the big businesses and the announcement of yesterday new measures) suggests that, despite the critics of Merkel, one opened the way to the thesis that it is necessary to put order to the house.
But the red line that Germany traced is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that one envisions, one cannot exclude the one to abandon a monetary too stuffed zone of country not very serious.
And in that case, Germany always will be able to say us that she had warned some us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The similar tricks to the one of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The woven expulsion as a rule by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 game against Ajax in the League of the Champions did to flow a lot of ink on the anti-sportsman character of such behavior and if the two players should be punished by the UEFA.
As one knows it, some minutes before finishing the game (that their team already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost the time when they committed faults to determine the referee to show them the second yellow box.
Thus, and seen that Real Madrid will finish by being leader of his group, the two players will accomplish statutory penalty during the next game of the game of barrier against Auxerre and will be able to pass without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of UEFA punished with two games the trainer of the team, José Mourinho and of different ones are economical to the implied players.
The yellow provocation of a box in circumstances as this one or similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather frequents in the world of soccer.
She if is shed that she is part of the ethos, of the non written rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the apparent debate in the related case has itself to the Fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (that in his hymn posts nobility and the honor and that in past occasions condemned to a fine to its players for analogous acts) and to orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, that adds a more episode to his expanded history Of technician histrionique and provocative.
In any case, the required debate if this behavior type does not forbid expressly by the regulation indisputably the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions one commits a law fraud; for, in fact, they are respectful actions with the athletic regulation, but seem to evade his direction.
The question is to examine the harm type that they provoke to the athletic spirit.
One of the goods that understands the athletic spirit is physical integrity of the adverse players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangers, that is to say it did not there have violent game.
Another of these goods to which one one alludes with the correct game is to avoid that the team of the players infracteurs takes advantage in an unfair way of the opposite team, which is not the not case more.
Nevertheless, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that she does not suit herself to what one characterizes normally as cardsharping o fraud of the law, for his violation of the rules was not realized secretly to try to avoid penalty, but their action precisely tried to be most possible most evident to receive the pénalisation of the referee.
They awaited and they accepted gladly penalty.
Another question is the advantage type that the infracteurs obtain from the the intentioned examined faults.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a disability position to the rival and one does not obtain an advantage in the same not game more, for evidently the result of the action supposes the fact to leave their own team with less than players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next not game more, for the club could not count on these players.
Evidently the advantage consists in the Fact that the players will begin the next phase of the League of the Champions without boxes that can threaten their participation to a future game.
But that is an advantage in the long term, with a certain degree of indecision, for the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and to party that, with this action the players accomplish a game of penalty and pass to the second cycle of boxes, in which the due suspension to the accumulation of the boxes produces themselves with an of less than to the first cycle.
So that, to ascend the rungs, is not so clear that that is an advantage.
In final, these actions are not in contrast to the athletic spirit, of which does nonetheless left the taken strategic decisions that favor the profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not activate to avoid the application of penalty (that would be in fact a clear case of fraud of the law), m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they subjected to themselves her.
They took a strategic decision without frustrating the penalty or to flee that one.
Even if the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, in this occasion I think that one had a clear case of genius.
The debate, it seems me, appears because of two factors: for there was two car expulsions and because of the manner to transmit the director to provoke them.
The provoked evil to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of the offers to obtain the dinners of Christmas for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.

Since 2008, that is the origin of the difficult times, it ya a lot of companies that eliminated the collective dinners for budget reasons.
To maintain the tradition, a lot of employees the organize while paying of their own pockets.
Any is situation, they ask all of the prices of battle, confirms the president of Gremi of Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer one, at present, does not dare to predict how will be the parties this months.

In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal of the Rita, Market, The Was founded and other), the characteristic of the calendar supposed more early reservations, even as early as the beginning of the months of November.
"We did the impossible one to maintain the same prices of the past year, with menus for all the tastes of 19.95 to 30 Euros," they detail.

They see also the first signs of improvement in certain companies invite again their employees and the sensation as the volume of the groups increased a little.
From the employers Fecasarm (that includes entities as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Recreation of Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility to begin seeing the final one tunnel and supports that on the whole the reservations are "animated," even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum."
That is true, the hope in the matter of festivities did not lower, indifféremment of that pays, it indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a big worry to the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a quicker rhythm than imports only other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American embassy of Pakistan and the Department of the State of the United States filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirms the huge worries that provokes to Washington programs it Pakistani nuclear.
To party the lighting up details and savors that offer on the content of the conversations and thought about the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the Fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the domain of the atomic security, instead of increasing, "subsides" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a than other any quicker rhythm country of the world."
The characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear program - the Fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make their destruction difficult in case of attack - is one of the principal reasons of concerns to Washington.
This is as well as the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, enumerates in a report before the visit of the former counselor of National Security, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations of the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of the nuclear materials of which the noise runs and the vulnerability of the transportation of atomic materials."
The big number of implied people in the nuclear arsenals and in the missile programs is envisioned, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has hiring of the personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear installations; being given the decrease of the educational and cultural levels the extremist organizations have more timeliness to recruit people that works in the nuclear programs or of missiles" declared the expert Yuri Korolev, Ministry of External Russians for a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new one documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the cooperation every time more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the domain of the nuclear proliferation and the student degree Pakistani of production of nuclear weapon.
A dispatch of the Embassy in May, that qualifies as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: "The transparency is frequently nonexistent; the assistance offers remain without response or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of National Intelligence for the south of Asia, notes that "despite the economical catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a than other any quicker rhythm country of the world."
The ambassadress Patterson required also to Washington, for a visit of the boss of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, that it does to understand "very clearly" to the person in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the support tacite to the terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the boss of Wikileaks
Obama will number to a high representative for the anti-terrorist fight to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alarm to follow the movements and to localize to Assange.
All the aspects linked to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emitted a "red alarm" for "to localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a matter not on the order of traditional arrest.
What's more, this one is not new, otherwise it November 20 date.
And this one has nothing at indeed with the last filtration of more of a millions of quarter diplomatic documents of the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse than the Australian confronts in Sweden.
What's more, the lawyer creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mister Assange."
The 20 the body policeman international having the seat to Lyon (France) dictated the order to asks Sweden, but it did not do it public even yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or to localize Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and his extradition."
Even if Interpol not can give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alarm, a lot of the member nations, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the call red notice a free way for the arrest -- that the national body of the police must realize -, specially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as this is the case of Sweden and England, where one thinks that Assange is located.
The movement has indignant to the lawyers of Assange, that yesterday published a letter dénonceant the Fact that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, showed itself willing to reply by video lecture to the questions of Swedish authorities.
They recall as as Assange solicited and obtained the permit go out of Sweden of the prosecutor of his case, that one compares to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, boss of the security of Stalin.
"That seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world looks for it - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to find itself in an unknown place, but it not himself tait.
On Mondays it granted as early as an indeterminate place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which it asked the resignation of the secretary of the State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If one can show that she was responsible to have to give orders to the American graduates that they épient to the UN in violent treated them international that the United States signed, she should resign," he says.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the secretary of press of the White House, Robert Gibbs, that qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I not at all am sure why the opinion of a type with a page web should interest us," has it declared for the CNN.
Obama loaded itself a high representative of the anti-terrorist fight, Rusell Breadth, to prevent from new escapes of documents.
The essay of the Spokesperson of the president Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the opinions that the politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the delegate that from January will preside the Committee of National Security in the Lower House asked the Department of the State that it studies the possibility to include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and to follow to any person that furnishes them contributions or assistance."
Again further went Tom Flanagan, a counselor of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, that has of the to go back over its declarations after saying that Assange will have "to be murdered."
"Obama should transform it in objective and wear an airplane without crew or similar something."
A person that did not ask of the excuse was Mike Huckabee, minister Baptist, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"The one that is located in the Government that filtered the news is guilty treason and all that is not an execution would be a too nice punishment," has it declared for Fox.
Puigcercós looks for the peace in ERC with winks to the followers of Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret votation on his continuity.
Huguet proposes an executive one more plural and the end of the system of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the énième offends internal inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 representatives and the half of the votes.
The president on the part is conscious on account of the fact that his resignation threat is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís carod-rovira, but at the same time it knows that the influence of this sector now also is diluted as his liar and as that absolutely cannot give him headaches as it had with of extinct current others.
It is for that that the leader of Esquerra will try to win its new critics with winks that allow him to harden until the municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national counselors of ERC will be able to pronounce themselves on his continuity in secret.
By vote bulletins, not while getting up the hand.
If the carodistes want to carry a certain vote of pénalisation to the president, they will be able to do it without any fear to reprisals.
Indeed, the boss of rows wants to avoid the picture of division and the one of submission to his person.
In several interviews it asserted that it would not consider himself ratified with the half more one of the votes, but it added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian one" would not be not good more.
The people close to Carod demand to the president a little more than to put his position at the disposal of the militance, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós checks the organ maxim between the congresses.
But for they do not dispose any a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to accept with the executive a leaf of road to the months of May.
For that, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will subject to the votation of the national counsel the 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of this one to program the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider as a sure fact.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" affects stability and that his objective is to do that once for all the organization is able to wash his linen room in family.
In this line, the item that the current counselor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatique.
Considered the idéologue of Puigcercós, the tenured of Innovació thought that the Fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" this is as if had been done.
And it enumerated five, of which it underlines two.
The first one, "to reconstruct" the executive for that it represents at least 90% of the militance, that is to say, include new faces that originate sector follower of Carod.
The second can be the character of new big one.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidates of once for all the assembly as functioning mechanism.
Thus, it defends one reforms statutes that allows the realization of the congresses through of delegates elected by vote.
Finish with the assembly model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, that already fought in this direction in the two last congresses.
Indeed, contorts it conclave of 2008 loaded the direction to revise the assembly model in a specific congress of reforms statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, for the internal tide of the last years did not recommend approaching this subject.
Now, without sectors criticize to the hiding-place, the moment could be good to resume it and to close it for always.

Obama promotes in Twitter the law to favor of the students without papers
"If you agrees with the approval of the Law Dream Act, calls shooting senators and ask them to approve this legislation," has Twitté the American president in the popular social network.
The president Barack Obama is itself meets today to the national mobilization to support the Law Dream Act, to legalize the students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agrees with the approval of the Law Dream Act, calls shooting senators and ask them to approve this legislation," has Twitté Obama.
His current message maintains open a cybernetic link with an ampler document that asks the public to contact immediately the senators, for the vote to the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that one hopes soon, now this is the moment to listen your voice," it signals.
The message was divulged after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the reductions of the taxes of the era of Bush and the financing of the government extend themselves.
Such a locking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and of other projects as the ratification of the new treaty START with the Russia against the proliferation of the nuclear weapons.
Questioned on the republican locking of the Law Dream Act and of other projects, the presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs declared that it is confidant that once the fiscal problem is resolved one will be able to set up an agende for the remainder of the projects.
"I think that one has a lot of times. .."

The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize 800 thousand young ones that arrived to the United States before the age of 16 years, they remained in this country the five last years and they were accepted by an institution of superior education or by the Army.
But the supporters necessitate 60 votes to approve the initiative, reason for which they necessitate the competition of a big number of republicans, in moments where the organizations partisanes of the project protagonists an excessive lobbying to guarantee the approval of the Law.
The democrats, the majority of which ones supports the Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless at least one of them, the senator Well Nelson of Nebraska, said that it would vote in against and only a republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for that that the favoring Dream Act necessitate the vote of several republicans if of other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the republicans the done more woo there are the senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the senator going out George Lemieux, of Florida, that completed the known mandate senator Mel Martínez.
Of republican others that supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they declared that they were not going to support it in another occasion.
A republican other that supported it, John McCain, did not define his posture so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree with the Fact that the bigger obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literatures one puts the finger on the wound
The second step of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which participating them did display of the narration
"The sex in the language, do I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? qu'espère-t-on of me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited has to open the second step of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that famous the literature in Spaniard and that this time used the subtitle of his question (for another fails the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, has did she explain).
The finger on the wound" ...nous puts in the difficulty," launched gently the writer Argentina to the public, most of the young ones, that had met to Fails it International of the Book of Guadalajara (WIRE) to listen this table moderate by Marisol Shultz and to which participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Shines García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a dedicated text to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a big history, with Luisa in first person as protagonist that looks for which knowledge is it "wound," she goes from one doctor to another, without obtaining a response, only tracks in the same narrative wire.
Infectiologue she goes out convinced: "Patience is not my fort, she is maybe my wound."
To the end, after a frustrated approach with the trauma specialist that cut him the breath in the middle of the corridor, but that explains him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "The wound is what is opened in reality, the symbolic one is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: "On the wound I only was able to know that it is that is opened in reality and that she does not exist," but convinced on account of the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must very be secured between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
The Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez exposed also a charming narration as it entitled Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but to a given moment is discovered.
With keys of magic realism, it talks about a fine charmer that touched clouds, did to return people that had gone themselves far or repaired virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narration that ledge to speak next America, the new big one that had as early as the beginning its own columnists and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo that critical the excesses of the narrations of the conquering capitans.
"Cervantes that invented us all (the writers) made fun of of the false witnesses that appeared in the presented histories as real, but of an aitre manner one would never have told the history of the America with an imagination that lacked even of the modesty."
Nevertheless, has it underlined, "the crazy and the liars have the better imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, one no longer knows which leaves the narration belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction attains his apogee.
One calls that of fact the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his inheritance that one one tells."
To his turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the WIRE with his round table has It on the wound.
The cubaine-portoricaine has puts his on the big wound of the social violence that his country crosses - and Latin America divides - produce of the disputes of the trafique and sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain an engagement tacite that not of course is premeditated," has she indicated, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the engagement that establishes itself between the author and the readers, and that this is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Shines García Montero that underlined also "this duty on the wound of the engaged writer."
It considered that in a world that lives in big speed also in the matter of the intellectual habits and the control of the consciences that turns to the advantage of the dogmatismes, "behind every affirmation there is a small not one and behind every negation there is a small one yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of the reality, we must shade: and shade means a lot of times to put the finger on the wound and to disturb the people that feel very convenient while thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and disturb also to the strengths that prefer a world in white and black," he says, while inviting to Recover the direction to write.

The strategist santiste arrived to his first final one as entraineur in the Tournament of Opening 2002, when it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Fence 2003 it also arrived to the decisive duel and lost again with the global result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a back, for his team did a game equals of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties it obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two timeliness to obtain the title and finally three of its players spoiled of 11 meters and It suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two final ones with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival to tournament, consequently it does not want to have the same goes out, it tries to detach itself evil spell to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if it asserts that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, that is for a club, not for a passion that I have and consequently I will obtain the title, but which I mentioned before is more important," commented on the timonier when one asked him which would be its weak points in the final ones.
It remembers a lot of the last final one, of which ones it assures that it a lot learned, "the unique lesson that we can keep it is that until the referee does not whistle the final one, we cannot celebrate, we prepared in the line, the players also, for the last time, with two penalties to already pull were prepared us to run and I believe that that is a lesson, before the Fine of the game one cannot celebrate."
It knows that this series could define themselves by penalties, which not the worried step, for it confides in its players: "One not tries never to arrive to the series of penalties, one tries to finish in the uniform delay, but sometimes it we remain only we to prepare, previous tournament were prepared us, unfortunately the destiny did us a bad turn, sometimes this are the emotions or the anguish to hold the title between our hands, hands it escaped us, that served us as lesson for this Final and we hope that one no longer arrives in that position."
Gypsy has now the occasion of not more to be a technician under champion and taste for the first time glory offered by the titles.

These searches took place following a long-term investigation, that lasted very close to a year.
"It is received information of the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," specified Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 policemen of regional unit of investigates Estrie of the Safety of the Quebec, police force of Sherbrooke and of the Governed police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration will be able to continue without problem
The project of law of the conservative ones that, according to the government, should regulate the problem of the loaded boats of clandestine migrant ones, goes quite obviously to be beaten while the three parties of opposition made known Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly lean on the Charter."
"I hold myself standing with a party that created slubs it under your feet," declared the liberal boss Michael Ignatieff, while it was surrounded by representatives after the held weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals claim that the project of such as proposed law, that would allow holding until a year any originating person of an identified vessel as transporting of the clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of the rights and liberties.
The boss of the Quebec Pad, Gilles Duceppe, equally indicated that it could not support the law project, because it takes it out on the bad target.
"We are against and it seems that all the parties of the opposition are against, then one will see what the government done," declared Mr. Duceppe.
The critic of the NPD regarding immigration, Olive Tree Chow, rejected back of the hand the critics wanting that his party is not rather firm concerning the clandestine immigrants.
"The neos democrats are in agreement for that one takes measures against the smugglers of clandestine ones and this we do by the mediated of another project of law, the C-35," indicated Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the project of law of the conservative ones because it takes it out on the refugees and imprisons the children during at least a year," explained Mrs Chow.
The minister of the Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the parties of opposition to play political and to be unaware of the will of the Canadians.
"The said Canadians massively to the representatives that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and that treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect that Canada takes measures close," reacted the minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a confidence vote on his law project, which could have taken the country to elections happening his rejection.
A conservative one nevertheless said to the Agency QMI that the government was going to ask a vote for that every representative that will oppose itself explains next in front of its voters.
The new not done unity unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unity to fight against the corruption and the collusion by John Charest, many observers continue to ask the creation of a commission of public investigation on the subject.
The minister of the public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea does not date any yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York to this subject as early as last January.
The metropolis possesses a permanent unity on the corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Tuesday some surprised more of one.
It is necessary to say that at the time of an encounter of the permanent Counsel on the services policemen of the Quebec, October 29 last, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was necessary some not more for than the critic péquiste in public security matters, Stéphane Bergeron, qualifies this announcement of "rabbit gone out of a hat" and of "tinkered with solution on the corner of a table."
The minister Dutil for his part replied to those that fear that the political strength has too much influences on the future possible unity.
"You will see the result when one will announce it, it satisfies itself to assert."
"One is conscious that problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Similar Réjean, nothing can replace the set up of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest perseveres to not to want to create this investigation commission, more the people think as you and me than it has something to hide," it explains.
"The only means to have an investigation commission, this is the resignation of John Charest," explains for his part Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and of governance to the national School of public administration.
Go out of this dead end, it suggests therefore to Quebec to give a special mandate to the general controller so that it investigates on collusion and the corruption.
"One must be able to widen the mandate of the general controller," it splits.
It estimates equally that Quebec could give to the controller the same be able that to a commissioner, allowing him thus to oblige people to testify.
The permanent creation of a squad is not the only project in the boxes of the government Charest.
Required Quebec equally to Ottawa to modify the criminal Code in order more better to be adapted to this crime type.
This request would emanate prosecutor of the operation Hammer, that informed the minister of Justice John marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this investigation kind.
The federal minister of the public Security, Vic Toews, for his part confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, leans itself presently on certain amendments linked to this file.
At the time of the operation Spring 2001, that hit the groups of motorcyclists, even if the criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were stopped.
Ottawa afterward did to adopt the Law on the gangstérisme.

A landslide is arisen Wednesday afternoon, to Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a manner preventive.
In evening, another sliding would have produced itself to Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sagged itself.

Of 20 to 40 additional millimeters of rain were awaited here Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sectors to the north of the river and in the valley of the Outaouais the were more touched.
They could receive until 100 millimeters of rain altogether.
As it is necessary to add these precipitations to the bottom of the already accumulated snow in certain sectors, one fears the flood of several courses of water.
Warnings of alarm of flood were emitted Wednesday evening by the civil Security of the Quebec for the rivers Ouareau and the Bass, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, to Holy jérôme, in the Laurentides, and Oak, in Lotbinière, did as for them the object of eves of flood and remained under supervision.
In the region of Lanaudière, the strong precipitations induced the flood of certain lakes, to Julian Holy, to Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as to Rawdon.
To Holy calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the strong rains.
Ten residences must have been evacuated a measure preventive.
In Outaouais, the flood of certain lakes induced the closing of several ways, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.

Dupont partially blamé
The coordinator of radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont underwent a partial back in front of the Canadian Counsel of the norms of the radiotélévision (CCNR) for some controversial positions on the social assistance and the Haitian ones just like on his crude language in waves.
The CCNR judges that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain matters contained of "inexact information on the social assistance, unduly negative representations of the Haitian and crude language that does not suit the broadcast transmissions during the day."
The Counsel equally concluded that a discussion on the suicide, including the broadcasting of the name of two people that had committed suicide, did not infringe the codes on the broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints on the subject of commentaries done during broadcast transmissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was returned following a complaint of the common Forehead of the social attended people of the Quebec.
The group complained that the quoted amounts in the transmission were inexact.
The coordinators must present solid rather than pieces of information misleading.
Concerning the suicide, the coordinator Stéphane Dupont had considered that the suicide is a gesture of coward.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the carried message was that the suicide must not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned of" Dupont the noon" approached a delicate subject in an equitable way and fitting."
No criticism has therefore withheld summer to his place.
The last litigation concerned declarations that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Reemerged John Dufort then had delivered itself to a face-to-media face that had given rise to a lot of reactions.
The coordinator of CHOI declared that it had not done any gift to help the Haitian ones because one could not know with certainty that the needy people receipts really money.
The Committee believes that these commentaries were not improper, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of the Haitian ones.
"I already purged my suspension of three days there over."
"My file is virgin since a year and half," declared the coordinator.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the broadcasting of crude language.
In every case, the radiodiffuseur choi-fm collaborated "beyond his obligation."
The consequences are slight for the station that will have, among others, announce these decisions once during the hours of big one listens within a period of three days.
A king of the kung-fu to Montreal
The Montréalais of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special journey.
The athlete that excellent in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing climbs on the tatamis and the rings of the world to the research again challenges.
"I began practicing the martial arts as the kung-fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with the professionals."
"In my case, I look for fight a little everywhere, since for those that do not like the game to the present ground in mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one that works by way of agent of security and as clerk for the company UPS exactly delivered of new bad ones to its rivals, winning two give an award to of now to the avid World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), of the 23 to October 30, to Edinburgh, in Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and of Thai boxing, it explained."
"Currently, I get ready to go in China for the World Cup of san shou."
"The fighters that finished among the four first ones at the time of the last World Championship in every category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 to Toronto."
"In 2005, to the Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament to the fifth row, while I arrived third to Toronto in 2009, it added."
"What is interesting is that I progressed to every competition."
"To this rhythm, I will be first this time or the next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a native discipline of China where the blows of fist and of foot, just like the projections to the ground, are authorized.
The duels originally unfold themselves on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The pugiliste the more fame coming from this fight form is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung It, well recognized in the world of the martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to keep only a single event in his career, it will reply assuredly his presence to the great tournament "King of Sanda," the Great Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition the is more raised and the most prestigious one in China, explained the likable sly devil."
"This is a little the equivalent of the Stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand)."
"Ç'a been a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in semifinal of his category (80 kg), before losing in final.
"The one that overcame me was a true pro one, it analyzed."
"There are four fighters by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winning ones of semifinals confront themselves in final of their category."
"Next, the conquerors of every category face themselves in order to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts irrevocably of offers
Hydro-québec granted will to will 450 millions of dollars in contracts to firms of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
To the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a formed consortium of the firms BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor that obtained the most important, the one of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 millions of dollars irrevocably of offers.
This consortium called Energy management was constituted in 2004 in a manner concomitant to the choice of hydro-québec to entrust to the private sector his responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion dollars.
At first of 2005, the consortium Energy management unhook the lucrative contract without there being call of public offers.
For the Quebec Party, the recourse to consortiums of businesses puts a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating the competition and to provoke an increase of the prices.
"This is the new manner to do collusion and to cut down the competition."
"C'est-à-dire that the people, instead of doing that in a manner secret, now do it in a manner open," declared yesterday the representative péquiste Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the national Assembly because it says to see with difficulty how the interest of the public can be used this manner.
The minister of the natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, retorted in afternoon, denying vigorously that there was collusion for this contract.
"I begin having my trip," she cursed, supporting that the PQ had been "disnonest" and had "missed of harshness."
She said that "this would be the least one things" that the PQ is sorry.
The formula of the consortiums is a current practice in the entire world.
It is a matter habitually of a limited alliance in the time that allows two or several businesses to group together their respective expertise in order to reply to an offer call for a complex project.
The project Eastmain consisting of a high level of complexity considering the extent of the works.
The work-site is in course and must spread out itself up to 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was attributed without the game of the effective competition; there being negotiation.
Also, the formula of the consortiums no longer is an exception to the Quebec, even for comparatively simple projects.
As revealed it last week The Duty, the formula of the consortiums in the sector of the genius counsel is the object of an investigation to the government.
A quick flying over of the register of the businesses of the Quebec allows counting more than 200 consortiums, of which some seem permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its principal competitors, of which CIMA +, Génivar, snc-lavalin and other Rocks and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are some tens, brings back to a single one and even moral person, is Dessau.
With regards to the consortium Energy management, the minister Normandeau underlined that "the territory of the Bay James replies to special dynamics of manpower and that hydro-québec there replies in a manner special since the years 70."
The big employer of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, Corporation of energy of the Bay James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that did sourciller on the Fact that the contract of management of the project was granted will to will.
"If you go in call of offers and that there is few soumissionnaires, your prices more students."
"You have two choices: is that you take the people that are in that market and that you say: one will negotiate a satisfactory understanding and with a good price."
"But the idea, it is that this not is the price that is important, this is the competence of the people," asserted Mr. Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium Energy management is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50 000 $ obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were granted by hydro-québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, The To Must counted 109 contracts of genius counsel granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or to their affiliates, notably laboratories of grounds.
Snc-lavalin swiped 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation to Energy management.
All the contracts were negotiated.
They total 449 783 344 $, including the contract to Energy management of 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard gave to understand that the four firms that compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "well known to the liberal Party of the Quebec."
The minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is equally linked to these firms that the "finance," before specifying that it was a matter rather of its leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption - THE label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer does very little confidence to the actors of the sustainable development, but equally to the equitable brands and to the certifications écologisantes to guide its choices.
Worse, even if it bathes in a media universe where the messages in favor of a more responsible consumption proliferate, it deplores a lack of credible information, lack that it qualifies even brake to his engagement, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, of which the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they let the consumption of said products increase socially person in charge in 2010, the Quebec one seem nevertheless to grant very few credit to those that try to sell them.
Two third of them say in fact not to believe the environmental engagement of the businesses just as green advertising of the companies, reveals the measure tool elaborated by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of the University Sherbrooke.
Other report: the half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certifications affixed on the equitable said products, but also credibility of the products and brands posting itself as being écoresponsables, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of the politicians on this theme is taken to the serious one by only 14.6% of the Quebec one.
The information in consumer matter person in charge seems nevertheless essential to stimulate this section of the animated consumption currently by near third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and the doubtful character of information would calm the fervors of 46% of the consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Besides, a third of the Quebec one are said so distrusting towards alleged performances of the products or green services as one looks for to put them between the hands.
On another notes, the consumers were close to the half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed of marks one or more products to reply to their conviction.
To height of 61%, they also favored purchases with merchants of their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food products cultivated in their region, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and person in charge - the index of the responsible consumption attained 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year -, the Homo consumus of the Quebec likes to present itself as the king of the recycling that tries reduce his environmental impression while worrying about the protection of the animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems nevertheless to remain at the exterior one of his car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, scarcely 28% of the Quebec one indicated to have used the public transit or recommended the covoiturage to defend their green interests.
The market and the bicycle were equally supported by 39.1% of the participants to this vast behavioral investigation, that has just taken his first cliché.
A ready one State for the buyback of eXcentris
The government of the Quebec, to that one asked to be involved itself financially in the buyback of the complex of movie eXcentris by the Corporation Angus and the Parallel, accepts collaborating, but to competition of a ready one only.
The Corporation of development Angus and the Parallel, that hoped a gift of seven millions of dollars of the ministry of the Culture to repurchase to Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Lawrence while giving again him his full vocation cinéphilique, do not obtain what they claimed.
The government accepts implying itself in the file, but to its own conditions.
Rather than the gift awaited, the government of the Quebec proposes a ready one of which climbing it would be besides inferior to the initial expectations, which could constitute a solution viable to advantageous conditions, of the less than the opinion of the sources coming from the officines of the State.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million already had been rejected by Quebec the last spring, but requests have since reviewed summers downwards.
A suggestion and an action plan were sent to the minister st-pierre by the president of the Corporation of development of the cultural businesses (SODEC), François Macerola, that pilots the file of eXcentris.
It sent him an ultimate report about ten days ago.
But the counterproposal of the office succeeded in the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 for there to reply.
It seems nevertheless that the hypothesis of the gift of the State really must be separated.
Let's recall that the Association of the owners of movies and of cinéparcs of the Quebec opposed itself to a direct investment of the State to support the buyback of eXcentris, deducing that the ministry of the Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other rooms of movie.
But several participants of the environment claimed on the contrary a substantial economical assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, has for ten years carried at arm's length the movie of author in its local ones of the complex after financing his construction itself, which could justify a dispensation from the Counsel of the treasure.
The room lack for the independent films is screaming to Montreal, and eXcentris had known to make loyal his clientele.
The Corporation Angus and the Parallel, with to their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, for their part, a financing country to the deprived, hoping to collect 700 000 $ to push to the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring 2009, a single of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of the futures buyers is to reopen the three February 27 next rooms while projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Of The men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Duty and one is unaware of what him and his group think about the suggestions downwards that are done them.
The raised sail on a self-conscious Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by raised WikiLeaks the sail on what the United States consider as the complex of inferiority of the Canadians towards the Americans, but they betray same blow the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats astonish themselves that every Canadian voter does not have relations canado-américaines to the spirit leaving to vote and believe that the visit of the president Obama helped the conservative government to let his budget adopt in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy to Ottawa and Washington, spread out over the public place yesterday, offer more crunchy details that of the substantial content to put itself under the tooth.
A cable dated back to September 22 2008, is in the middle of the federal election campaign, relates to which not at all the United States do not do left the issues discussed by the political bosses.
To the big astonishment of the American ambassador in post to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations to this position.
"An inferiority Canadian almost inherent complex conditions maybe the Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the Newspaper rather than to let this election carry on the United States (as at the time of the country on the free exchange of 1988) ," it writes.
The United States are therefore, it concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening for about it to speak."
The ambassador understands so much less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an excessive political and relation economical.
"Logically, it estimates, the capacity of a candidate, on a part and again more of a boss of party to manage this essential relation should be a factor key than the voters have at the spirit leaving to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in the sharp cable January 22 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires to Ottawa, preparing the president Barack Obama to his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to assure the survival of the government at the time of the confidence vote at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post his first deficit what's more of a decade because of a plan of restarts of 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
No one leaves it is done mention only the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition parties returned his conditional survival to the quality of the plan of restarts proposed.
Another communication, dated back to January 2008 and signed of the ambassador Wilkins, notifies Washington of the more and more negative picture than the dramatic series broadcast to CBC send back United States.
The ambassador worries about the transmissions To Trim, Little Mosque one the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which ones one observes references not very subtle to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or again to the abductions for muscular questionings of the CIA.
Another cable relates that, at the time of their first bilateral encounter, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome certain prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case."
At the end of the encounter, it is written, "it put back a paper to the secretary of state about Omar Khadr, a Moslem of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary accepted reviewing the file."
Let's note at last that the spirits s'échauffent themselves concerning the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close of Stephen Harper, declared on the waves of CBC that the massive person in charge of this escape should be "murdered."
It was done the echo of Mike Huckabee to the United States.
A world-wide plan to renovate the lighting
The UN proposed yesterday to Cancún a plan of renovation of the lighting domesticates, commercial and industrial in 100 countries regarding to obtain a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds almost to the third of the additional reduction that it is necessary to realize to stabilize the planetary climate of here 2020.
This ambitious plan is situated in the crowd of the big concrete projects that the UN hopes to do to adopt to Cancún to compensate the absence of engagements constraining of reduction by the industrialized countries.
According to the deposited plan yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize again of 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs fluocompactes or, better, by bulbs to electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion thunder (Gt) of emitted GES on the planet to light up the humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible of 8% of the world-wide transmissions.
This is the equivalent one of 70% of the transmissions of the park automobile planetary.
To Copenhagen, the last year, the big transmitting countries, as the United States, China, Europe and of others, of which Canada, were involved themselves in voluntary plans of reduction that should let the global transmissions pass of GES of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this report again 5 Gt to arrive to stabilize of here 2020 the increase of the climate to 2 degrees centrigrade in order to avoid that it does not become outside check.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates itself in the form of a heat and the remainder, is 5%, produces light.
With bulbs fluocompactes, the energy expenditure is reduced of 75% and with the new bulbs to DEL, one reduces this need of energy of two times again.
The bulbs fluocompactes last in average of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new bulbs to DEL, as the one that launched the manufacturing Philips this week - this corporation has besides participated in the study of the UN -, have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less than energy that an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs also can work with rhéostats what's more to emit very few heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists posted reserves to the place of the bulbs fluocompactes since they contain mercury and that it is necessary to eliminate them as dangerous losses, which is not always possible in the developing country, safe if the manufacturers set up of the record.
But, indicate the report, the principal source of transmission of mercury on the planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the thermal central ones to coal, that emit a lot of mercuries to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
To the United States only, these central ones emit 25 000 tons of mercury by year.
The report details the gains that would do each country thanks to this international program.
For example, the Indonesia would save thus a billion dollars per year in purchases of electricity and eight millions of tons of CARBON DIOXIDE, is the equivalent one of 3.5 thermal central ones of which the construction would cost him 2.5 billions.
Ivory Coast awaits in the nervousness announces it electoral results
The general secretary of the UN, Drum roll ki-moon, claimed the publication "without delay" results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiration of the fixed delays.
"The general secretary underlines the necessity for the independent electoral commission to finish his work and to announce the provisional results without more of delay, underlined a spokesperson of the boss of the UN."
"It asks all the parties from the Ivory Coast and to the institutions to show responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures exercised by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission left to pass the date stop of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the ballot of Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiration of the delay, the president of the CEI had asserted to the television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied themselves Wednesday in the world for that the CEI proclaims at last the name of the conqueror of the second turn between the exit Laurent Gbagbo and opposing it Alassane Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo counts on the cancellation by the constitutional Counsel of vote "frauduleux" in the north, held by the former rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the blow of missed State of September 2002.
Easter Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the president from the Ivory Coast, asserted that the maneuvers of intimidation of the voters practiced by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the favoring president going out of be going to vote.
All the election could be canceled if the complaints deposited by Gbagbo are kept by the constitutional Counsel.
Now the opponents of Gbagbo consider that the highest course of the country is not neuter for she is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close ally politics of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North that denies any link with the former rebels, judged "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go until to claim the victory.
Its allies assert that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that it lost and that to carry complaint in front of the constitutional Counsel, after preventing the electoral commission broadcasting the results, would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidential one, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a remained country split up in two during years.
The united Nations warned Wednesday classifies it political from the Ivory Coast that she could be held responsible eventual violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in head of the first turn, October 31, with 38% of the voices against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, that received the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% to the first turn).

Matter Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of the Syria
During more than ten months, of July 2009 to May 2010, the go out of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher stopped in Iran for "spying," held the opinion in breath in France, put the diplomacy in alarm, and stressed the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
The all under the attentive look of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal certain under of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained his strategy to the Americans, going until to give them counsels for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French people in charge tried convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman had not had for compensation released it Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and in demand by American justice for illegal dealings in materials to the profit of the Iranian nuclear program.
At last, they place under a raw light the manner of which the French presidency tried handle the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it not some was anything.
A diplomatic composed telegram August 12 2009 to Paris is entitled "Iran: French commentaries on the manner to manage cases of hostages."
The counselor of the Elysée for the strategic matters, François Richier, accompanied director of the Quay of Orsay for the Africa of the North and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, maintain themselves with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain him the French method.
They counsel to the Americans of some to do as much to repatriate their own withheld nationals of forces in Iran.
"Done the noise," they say, "hammer continually" in the media the words "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
It is necessary for it in order to embarrass the Iranian, sensitive system to his picture.
"Done it so much more than the Iranian ones ask you of not to do it."
For, passed the discussion attempts by discreet canals, "the silence will regulate nothing," the Iranian ones are "masters in delaying maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactics: the taken hostages for the political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of prison of Clotilde Reiss (that will intervene August 16, day where she takes refuge herself to the embassy of France) "will necessitate the payment to the Iranian ones of a wide sum of money" (230 000 Euros of guarantee).
And it makes known that the Elysée anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "will worsen itself."
The Iranian ones can "in a future close to stop another of the some 1 800 living French citizens in Iran," he says.
August 28 2009.
Clotilde Reiss went out of prison since twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is broadcasted: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, of which the United States claim the extradition for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic equipment towards the Iran, is released to Paris, on decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as many observers, wonders on this disturbance coincidence.
For Washington, that stalks the Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of equipment intend for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad new one.
Did France accept a bargaining?
The liberation of the Iranian one against the one of the Frenchwoman?
At the time of a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, has not only "summer completely take by surprise by the decision of the judge," but looked for to itself there to oppose.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (to the era, Michèle alliot-marie), but "the French government cannot go back over the decision" judicial, it observes.
Mr. Richier wants also to show as Majid Kakavand remains placed under the" narrow" supervision of the services of French pieces of information.
The counselor of the Elysée composes a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian one "currently is localized in buildings to Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée not household its efforts, by means of communiqués and of "escapes" organized in the media, to do to believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al assad plays a role "important" and "influential" of "mediator."
The Americans observe this not activity without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several items of press pass on the French official version.
A telegram dated back to August 25 2009 evokes "the 'blitz' media of the official French."
On what is founded so of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy to Paris.
"Despite their declarations a lot of praises, the official French recognize in deprived that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrian ones actually did."
The document leans itself next on the reasons that pushed the Elysée to lapse into this fiction.
The excessive effort of communication "aims to validate politics of Sarkozy of opening to the Syria," it analyzes.
A political one launched in 2008, that "then had been perceived, by many voices criticize in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris looks for to "to show to the which Syrias praises she can attract herself while playing a constructive role in the region."
The objective is also of "to sow seeds of discord between the Syria and the Iran."
The American embassy knows it good source.
August 11, François Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we not know if the Syrian did although this be."
"But we thanked them nonetheless."
"That should at least sow the confusion with the Iranian ones."
Clotilde Reiss returns in France May 16 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, it thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for the young Koreans passed midnight
The south korean government will adopt a said law "of Cinderella" that will forbid to the adolescent ones to play at online games after midnight while blocking their access, indicated governmental people in charge.
A law project will be subjected to the Parliament in December to ask the corporations of online games to block the access to these games after midnight, to the young ones of age less than 16 years, indicated representatives of the ministries of the culture and family.
"A lot of children play games the very night and have next difficulties to study at the school and to have a normal life during the day."
"We consider that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," declared to the AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial person in charge in charge of the law project.
The online games will be again accessible at 6 o'clock in the morning.
The corporations will have a year to prepare itself to the application of the law, it specified.
The government envisions equally to ask the corporations to limit the daily access time to these games for the young ones of which the parents in do the request, added the person in charge.
It also will put at the disposal of the people that the claim from free software that allow limiting the past time on Internet.
South Korea is the one of the countries the more "connected" and the newspapers uniformly retrieve various facts linked to an intensive usage of Internet.
The country is equally the undisputed champion of the world-wide competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had won four give an award to of now to the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World-wide 2018-2022: the Fifa designates the organizing countries
In the middle of the tempest because of corruption suspicions, the executive committee of the Fifa designates Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cup 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the fights of influence and the lobbying risk taking the step on the technical criteria.
A thing is sure, the edition 2018 of the competition queen of the Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The one of 2022 will be a lot more exotic, the hoping international Federation to conquer again territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first one on the African continent in 2010, or follow his establishment to the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities being part of the delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William, José Shines Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of the Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of state, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economical issues and politics of a World-wide one.
The negotations in slides risk therefore to last until the last minute.
For the remainder, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of the Fifa, the English files, hispano-portugais (2018) and American (2022) possess better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will weigh not very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee on time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, to the origin of the revelations having resulted in the suspension for corruption of two members of the THIS (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the luck of his country, cradle of the soccer that welcomed the World-wide one only a single time, in 1966.
The BBC put back a layer, Monday, while broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the THIS, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Of what to dissatisfy the Fifa and put in the difficulty the English people in charge, that launched themselves in an excessive lobbying the latter weeks with David Cameron in first line.
The government leader hopes to reprint the blow successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, that had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the JO-2012.
Will this excessive activity suffice to regild the reputation of the England with the THIS?
Nothing is less sure for duet Spain Portugal does not lack trumps with its already ready stadiums, his expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 to Barcelona, Euro-2004 to the Portugal) and his culture soccer.
But the dark economical and financial perspectives of the two countries could soak their ambitions.
Eventual reprisals against the English and the doubts on the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal do nothing but to increase the quotation of Russia, become a weight outsider despite the gaps of his file (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided of not to carry out the movement to Zurich and denounced a "disloyal competition in the preparation of the vote," in a scarcely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the THIS.
"One covers them with mud, one tries to compromise them," launched Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong of the experience of 1994, appear as the favorite logics.
First world-wide economical power, sits principal sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a length in advance on Japan and South Korea, that built separately a very beautiful project.
But these new candidacies appear premature for two countries having co-organisé the test in 2002.
Other threat: the granting of the World-wide one-2026 to China, fiercely wished by the Fifa, that would return null fact Asian luck for 2022.
With the Qatar, that has gone out the big game while proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would follow his expansion towards of new regions, but these two countries present more risks than of certainties.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, also could suffer as a result weakness of the rights TV acquitted (because of the gap schedule) by the European countries, the nerve of the war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: the evidence
Of Gaulle really had hesitated.
Mitterrand had done to believe that it hesitated.
Valéry Giscard of Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy again less than them.
A mandate to the Elysée in is called another.
Therefore the current boss of the State will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence not done good household with the party of attached mystery to the presidential function.
Then it is necessary to do as if the doubt always existed.
In a direction as in the other.
In 2006, even without there to believe, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
November 15, with an air engraves, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that it would take his decision "somewhere to the fall of the year 2011."
What it evokes in front of of the parliamentary UMP, Tuesday evening to the Elysée, the perspective of "two mandates" has therefore sown a little feverishness.
Does this Etait-ce announce it official of his candidacy?
One was some far.
The president did nothing but to recall that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year terms.
It did a report, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that it evokes the presidential one, on the tone of humor, at the time of such meet.
"To the worse one, or to the better, you have some again for seven years and half with me," it had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not believe that I do not reflect to the step of after."
Its matters before yesterday return it not more candidate than the day before; they return it not less.
If they give rise to commentaries, this is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy to the PS, on one hand.
But that did not enter it in lists of Royal Ségolène that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to unveil itself.
It is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that a lot to the PS claim a placement in order of than foreseen more precocious battle.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time the right voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to the one of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is not discussion to the UMP there over," has immediately and cautiously reacted the entourage of the Prime Minister.
"If it believes the possible defeat, it will not be candidate," confides John Rock Raffarin.
"It will always believe to be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the forced CEB to maintain its purchases of titles of State
The last meeting of the Counsel of the governors of the European central Bank (CEB) year had to be the occasion to specify the methods of go out of crisis or, less, to announce the stop of a good number of the non conventional operations of monetary policy that have s'achèver themselves at the end of the year.
Crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the institute of transmission of Frankfurt doubtless will not be able to allow itself to be so peremptory under penalty of to worsen a position more stretched today on the European bond markets.
The political cost in would be so much more student.
Yesterday, to the occasion of a press conference, the minister of the French Finances, Christine Lagarde, thus greeted the active role played by the CEB in favor of the resolution of the crisis of the debts of the States in Europe.
She did not wish to say if she considered that the central bank had to do more, while increasing for example his program of purchase of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...) ."
The day before, to Brussels, at the time of his hearing by the commission of the economical and monetary Matters the European Parliament, the president of the CEB, John claude Trichet, did not show itself more articulate as for its intention, being satisfied to indicate that the program of purchase of titles of State on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the time of the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the CEB will keep his principal unchanged prime rate to 1%, his lower historic level since May 2009.
In the facts, the purchases of obligations of the Treasure by the CEB doubled last week, to near of 1.35 billion Euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of operators of market, she would have carried out again purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday.
Altogether, the central banks of the eurosystème bought for 67 billion Euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, the anticipation of a pursuit of the purchases do not do any doubt (to see page 29).
The not economists do not await any notable change of cape.
If the operations of ready ones to more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal of the CEB, this last one proceeds again to limitless benefits of liquidities according to generous conditions and for lengths spreading themselves of a week to three months.
The economists expect today to what this device is extended of some months.
"I cannot imagine me that she modifies in an important way his program."
"Otherwise this would be to take the risk to provoke new tensions in the short one run," estimates Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit announced during the first quarter 2011 appears more probable," anticipates of his side Norbert Bräms, economist with Sal.
Oppenheim.
From the viewpoint of its interventions on the market of the public debt, "the CEB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to animate a lifeless market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Considering the importance of the expositions of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the Euro zone, the transmission institute does not have any other choices that to maintain his presence on the market.
"It is necessary for him to any price to substitute itself to the lack of investors on the market and to be a question of such sort to prevent an emballement of the yields paid by the States more fragile," testified an important bond administrator yesterday.
For if the interest rate fly away themselves, the States will be so much more bothered to reduce their debt, otherwise to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the Euro is at this price.
In Italy, the government Berlusconi done the round back
After a beginning of disturbing week for Italy, the position a little relaxed, yesterday, with the reflux of the bond rates to 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
To the go out of a meeting with the minister of the Economy, the region presidents said to have heard Giulio Tremonti to qualify the position of "indecipherable" and to expect a weekend "imprévisible," which the interested next denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had attained the record of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of cover against the bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown away itself to 263 points, inducing a certain panic to Rome.
In Counsel of the ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the gap with the German rates was superior to 400 basic points.
But his straight arm, Gianni Letta, declared itself "strongly preoccupied" by "the turbulences of the markets" and by a possible contagion in origin of Ireland.
"The new good one is that Italy, third economy of the Euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The new bad one is that she is as the Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist to the Hudson Institute.
In clear, his problem is the absence of growth and the atonie of the fiscal returns that goes with, doing to run to the State risks it not more to be able to cover its financing needs.
The last anticipations of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth henceforth is awaited to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget in examination course to the Senate table on respectively 1.3% and 2%.
In these conditions, calculate the European Commission, the public deficit will represent again 4.3% of the PIB the next year (against 3.9% foreseen ones by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
From which the rumor of a new collective one budget that could be set up after the parties, for an amount of 7 billion Euros.
"If necessary, of new measures of austerity will have to be taken," estimates the commissioner to the economical matters, Olli Rehn.
At present, Italy receives the support of the international institutions.
"The basic ones of his economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it since a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator to the international monetary Funds in charge of the Italy to the IMF.
"There is not problem for the time being, or on the current or on the long term, for in spite of his important debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, EDITOR'S NOTE), the required efforts of stabilization to Italy are least that those asked of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, economist in boss of the OCDE.
Remain the question of the political instability.
December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will confront a censorship proposal to the Room of the representatives, following what of the early elections could be organized at the end of March.
Would open then a period not very favorable to the taken decision in case of crisis engraves.
The Europeans reflect to the reinforcement of the devices anticrise
Christine Lagarde again hammered it yesterday in the framework of a press conference to Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that one again showed it Sunday in the day and in the night, are evidently united, determined, engaged to defend their change and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, the recorded relaxation yesterday on the rates of the European obligations of State brought water to the mill of the governments and CEB.
But one again cannot talk about a normalization beginning.
The credit agency Standard & Poor's announced that she could degrade the grade of the debt of the Portugal, the target the done more aim today by the speculation.
"As in May, there is a reality lacks clarity and of political visibility, that weighs notably on the bank systems," estimate the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
So much more than "the political time is well slower than the time of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and dangers that it conceals, the European countries intensify the discussions to reinforce the devices anticrise already existing.
The informal consultations between the ministers of the Finances the most directly concerned and, more widely, with their peers of the G20 go good train.
And this visible one also of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin of the beginning of next week.
The CEB meets today.
To the menu, the go out of the non conventional measures of support to the countries of the Euro zone in the collimator of the markets (to see above).
As for the European Funds of financial stability (FESF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday to Singapore a turn of Asia to inform the eastern extreme investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to get up of the funds, it in prepares certainly the land.
The first transmissions of titles of the FESF are foreseen next months.
Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted to the agency Reuters that the United States would support an eventual increase of the funds mobilized by an additional direct engagement of the IMF.
The countries that are in first line, the Portugal and Spain, as for them, prepare themselves to adopt structural reformations, notably regarding organization market of the work.
Reformations that add to the measures of austerity to more compared effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different way of those of Greece and Ireland.
The one and the other be attached to all price to avoid asking an international assistance before setting up their clean budget corrective ones and to decide essential structural reformations to give again durably confidence.
The European silent partners, at last, maintain themselves on the available options to accelerate the process of normalization of the markets of the sovereign obligations.
Of passage to Paris, November 24, Axel Weber had the first advanced one the idea that if the 750 billion Euros mobilized by Europe and the international monetary Funds were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to put back the hand to the wallet.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of very first plan of the market of the European sovereign debt, judge that an about extension 100 billion Euros would suffice, "preferably" under the form of direct injection of liquidities.
The vehicle exists: this is the European Mechanism of financial endowed stabilization, to this day, of 60 billion Euros.
A counsel that has all the luck to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions worsened.
Snow and verglas: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snow-covered episodes generate again difficulties of circulation, notably on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk perturbing certain economical activities.
Twenty-four departments are henceforth in orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and of verglas.
The Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, the Two Wean and the Coming, added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Forecast France, showers of sustained snow affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it weakly snows on l'Ile-de-France.
Of the put to bed going snow of 2 to 5 cm, punctually of 7 to 10 cm, are awaited for the concerned departments, and of 1 to 3 cm, indeed until 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The concerned departments are those of the Charente, charente-maritime, Coasts of Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Low regions Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow-covered episodes are notable suffisament to generate difficulties of circulation and to perturb certain economical activities, warns Forecast France.
In the Coasts of Armor, several regional ones were forbidden to the trucks of more than 7.5 tons, of which the axes guingamp-lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The circulation on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the policemen that recommend taking his vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of certain buses TER was suspended for the day.
The school transportations were forbidden for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisioned Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of the trucks.
The prefecture "invites all the motorists to the biggest prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving consequently."
The general Direction of the civil aviation (DGAC) asked the airline companies to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly because of the snow falls to come.
The DGAC recommends to the aerial passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, to the south of London, and the one of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed to Thursday morning.
Subway Big Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of the transportations in beaten Ile-de-France his full one, the billions rain.
In the discussion of the less.
One evokes in particular 23 billions for the subway Big Paris that must construct the Corporation of the Big Paris.
To start up this SGP, the State announced an allocation in capital of 4 billion Euros.
In the theoretical outline, it is this sum that will allow next to the SGP to borrow on the markets a part of the financing of his double curls.
Today, one in arrival at last to the first additions.
The law of revised finances 2010, examined in commission of the finances of the national Assembly this morning, contains the foreseen devices to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the special creation of a tax of equipment and an increase of the tax on the offices in Ile-de-France.
The first one, reads one in the text of the project of law, item 15, is "to the profit of the public establishment Corporation of the Big Paris."
She is amounted: "The product of this tax is of 117 million Euros per year."
The second is a réaménagement of a tax on the offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, of some to increase the product and to affect this increase to the Corporation of the Big Paris."
Would that retrieve how much?
Mystery.
This is not amounted in the text.
One is far of the 4 billions.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources add to the 4 billion Euros of the allocation in capital that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Corporation of the Big Paris progressively of the project," can one to read in the exposition of the motives.
To the SGP, one does not find this shocking system.
"Has to leave the moment where one created recipes (the two taxes, editor's note), one can cover the studies on three years then to type in the 4 billions after, there one explains."
"This will have been in line with the budget and pulled progressively."
The SGP considers that the 4 billions will begin being registered in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which the 4 billions promised are again to the absent subscribers, risks provoking a parliamentary a little restless discussion.
First public meeting December 7.
Vindictive hackers and spies speedily
The matter WikiLeaks has a double value.
On one hand, she reveals herself an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal only in front of the hypocrisy that governs the reports between the States, the citizens and the press.
Other, she announces deep changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by the regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is confirmation on account of the fact that every file constituted by a secret service (of some nation that this be) is composed exclusively of cuts of press.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi do nothing but to retrieve what since months could read itself in any newspaper (safe those of which Berlusconi is owner), and the sinisterly grotesque profile of Khadafi was since a long time for the artists of cabaret matter to sketch.
The rule according to which the secret files must be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go in a bookstore devoted to publications ésotériques, you will see that every work repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rosicrucian one) exactly which already was written in the previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do the unpublished research (does or do not know where to look for new on the nonexistent one), but because those that devote themselves to the occultisme believe only to what they already know, and that reconfirme which they already had learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited spirit) the boss of the secret services (otherwise it could be, that I know, editor to Liberation), that keeps as true only which it recognizes.
The news top secret on Berlusconi that the American embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State were the same that the one that Newsweek published the week before.
Did then why the revelations on these files so many noise?
On one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, to knowledge that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since that the bosses of States can telephone themselves or take an airplane meet at dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, exception done of some small exercises of representation, transformed themselves in center spying.
Any spectator of films of investigation knows very well that, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to be unaware of it.
Nevertheless, the fact to repeat it publicly violates the hypocrisy duty, and serves to place under a bad light the American diplomacy.
In second place, the idea that a hacker any can obtain the secrets the more secrets of the country more powerful of the world carries a non negligible blow to the prestige of the department of State.
Also the scandal puts not so in crisis the victims as the "butchers."
But let's come in to the deep nature of what arrived.
Formerly, to the time of Orwell, one could conceive any strength as a Big Brother that checked every gesture of its subjects.
The prophecy orwellienne had completely proved itself since that, being able to check every movement thanks to the telephone, every carried out transaction, the visited hotel, the expressway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of the strength.
But when one shows, as that arrives now, that even the crypts of the secrets of the strength cannot escape the check of a hacker, the check report stops being one-way and becomes circular.
The strength checks every citizen, but every citizen, or less the hacker - elected as vindictive of the citizen -, can know all the secrets of the strength.
How can a strength that no longer has the possibility to preserve its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secret is a secret empties (and secret emptiness will never be able to be unveiled); it is true, also, that any knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is effectively a secret empties secret, because raising public domain; but to reveal, as did it WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were secrets empty means to remove him all Be able.
WikiLeaks did not do any wrong to Sarkozy or to Merkel, but some did a too big one to Clinton and to Obama.
Which will be the inflicted consequences of this injury to a very powerful strength?
It is evident that in the future, the States will not be anymore able to post on-line any reserved information - that would come back to to publish it on a stuck poster on the corner of the street.
But it is all as evident one as with the current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain reports confidential by telephone.
Nothing of easier one than to discover if and when a boss of State moved itself in airplane and contacted the one of its colleagues.
How be will be able to maintained in the future the private and reserved reports?
I know although, for the moment, my anticipation raises science fiction and is therefore fictional, but I am obliged to imagine government agents that move themselves in a manner discreet in diligences to the uncontrollable itineraries, while being carriers only of messages memorize or, all to the more, while hiding the rare written information in the heel of a shoe.
The news will be preserved in unique copy in closed drawers to key: to the bottom, the attempt of spying of the Watergate had less than success that WikiLeaks.
I had the occasion to write that the technology advances now in crab, that is to say to back up.
A century after the télégraphe without wire revolutionized the communications, Internet reestablished a télégraphe on son (telephone).
The videos (analogical) had allowed the researchers in movie to explore a film not to not, leaving forward and behind and in while discovering all the secrets of the mounting, while now the CD (numerical) allow only to jump chapter in chapter, that is to say by macroportions.
With the trains to big speed, one goes Rome to Milan in three hours, while in airplane, and the movements that it includes, it is necessary three hours and half.
It is not therefore extraordinary that the political and the communication techniques come about it back to the cars to horse.
A last observation.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what wove itself in the secret of the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask confidential the news to the press.
Climate: how France fiddles with its financing promises
A year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time to examine the respect of the promises of quickly unblocked financings (said financings fast start or precocious) realized by the developed nations.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the agreement of Copenhagen, the developed nations were involved themselves to furnish 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion Euros on three years and France 1.26 billion Euros (is 420 million per year).
At the time of the opening of the COP16, THE E.U. has gone out the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of his engagement concerning the financings fast start: report retailer the action of its States members, press conference, big side event, pamphlet distribution...
The operation transparency is noticeable and appreciated to his just value: the developing country and the civil corporation would like that all the developed nations do even with a same level of precision.
THE E.U. announces to have released in 2010 2.2 billion Euros, which the placement on the good way for the respect of his engagement of 7.2 billions in 2012.
But when one looks in the detail, the things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the agreement of Copenhagen, "new and additional," in order to assure that an additional effort is realized without being to the detriment of the public Assistance to the development.
Unfortunately, it does not exist agreed on what means "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, certain States members of which France blocked the procedure.
Today, each chooses the reference that suits him the better.
The European Commission has for example considered as reference the year 2009: the international financings are maintained, and she there adds 150 million on three years to the title of the financings fast start.
Of other countries chose similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public assistance to the development.
To the opposed, France considers that the financings of "all the new projects" year 2010 are "new and additional."
Otherwise says, there is not reference to the expenditures of the preceding years or at the global level of Helps public to the development.
Concretely, the Total Amount of the support of the France to the developing country can remain stable (or even to diminish), she claims to respect his engagement regarding financings "new and additional..."
Other crucial element, the distribution between gifts and ready.
There again, it does not exist any rule and each chooses his calculation method.
Certain, as France, consider that 1€lent is equivalent to 1€given.
Evidemment, that is with difficulty justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the usage of ready ones can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects linked to the reduction of the transmissions that rest on more effective technologies), it is depceptive to present an Euro that one will recover as equivalent to an Euro that one gives... All to the more, should be counted to the title of its engagements only the cost of the ready one for the country lender (is the equivalent one of an interest rate).
But France has only to do such a reasoning: she "respects" his engagement of 420 million Euros while doing 91.5% of ready (389,8 million Euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36,1 million Euros) - to see the document of THE E.U. to verify by yourself.
She is the only country of the Union to use so massively the ready one.
Germany there requires to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia (in others) respect their engagements with 100% of gifts.
Otherwise says, when the very big majority of the European Union puts 1€to satisfy his engagement, France puts only 10 pennies and considers that the effort is comparable.
Pretty turn of past pass!
In summary, in his financing fast start, France operates a double swindle: on one hand on the evolution of the action in the time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
While spending only 36.1 million Euros, she arrives to do to believe that she in spends 420 million "new and additional" in coherence with its promises.
The manipulation of the ministry of the Finances (for it seems although it is Bercy that realized the refereeing) could have a double impact negative, at once within THE E.U. (why the other States members would continue to give if it suffices to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing country are do not completely fool...
The chapter of the precocious financings is only a small question, of relative one runs term, in comparison with the body of the discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand of more in the immense machine than is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that that will not be the case.
Although it is some, it is essential to pull the lesson of this first year of precocious financings.
First of all, France could announce a change in his counting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its engagements and of equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But especially, France could do to advance the discussions on the financing issues in the long term (other crucial discussed chapter currently): one will not escape the question of "the additionalité" or method of counting of the ready ones.
France could change his position to become so progressive on these issues as she is it on of others.
The hope rests therefore on the new minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-morizet, that will arrive to Cancun next week.
A surprised announcement on the fast start of France and on his vision of "the additionalité" and the usage of ready ones would be nature to increase the necessary international confidence level to advance in the discussions.
Agile to the pesticides ingested by the children
A child of 10 years ingests in a day 81 different chemical substances, according to a published study this Wednesday of the association Generations Future (former- Movement for the rights and the respect of the future generations).
The association, that warns that its results "do not have any value statistics significant to the look of the weak number of analyzed samples, but are illustrative of the problematic treaty," bought between July and September the generally consummate foods in four meals and an encas in a day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and of Paris.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations - five fruit and fresh vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as delicacies, were examined by laboratories to the research of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and polluting other.
The report of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances of which 42 are classified possible carcinogenic or probable and five classified certain carcinogenic substances as well as 37 likely substances to act as endocrinal disruptive (PE), according to studies of several institutions such Centers it international research on the cancer.
"Even if, in almost all the cases, legal limits for every chemical taken substance individually are not surpassed, one sees well in our investigation that the reality of the exposition of the consumers to the contaminating possibly carcinogenic and/or PE is preoccupying," notes the association.
For the breakfast, the butter and the tea to the milk contain to them only more of about ten possible carcinogenic residues and three proven ones as of the carcinogenic certain one as well as close to about twenty likely residues to perturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported Brazil, foreseen as encas by the study, presents chemical tracks of six substances of which a fungicide nevertheless forbids in France.
Same thing for the green beans of the Kenya, include in the lunch, on which these the study detected powerful tracks of an insecticide forbids in THE E.U.
Of more, the minced steak, the tuna in can, and even the stick of bread and the chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the faucet the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For the dinner, the salmon steak was the more "rich" with 34 chemical detected residues and even the examination of the plate in plastic used to reheat the meal to the microphone wave not some was exempts.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminate" "is probably under esteem," according to the study.
The alliance Europe Ecologie Them Green (ee-lv), of his side, proposed "facing the urgency of the position" to establish a moratorium on the usage of the pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of the diseases of civilization."
In July, a study of the European agency for the food security (EFSA) mentioned the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and consummate vegetables in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
