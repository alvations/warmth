That is what he will happen? cssd has been voldemort or pâtisserie in prague.
The new cssd elected to the capital 's mayoralty by a must apparently overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand the level of the city council with their old and new collegues of the ods.
The daily actualne. cz has "tested" the new members of the city council members to cssd, whether they know the argôt that was born in the dernieres years to the mayoral building, when it was the current coalition partners, which ruled in prague.
The vocabulary codé that the fig politics in prague has put in road over the previous era of the mayor pavel bem described some figures, situations, and causes of the city.
It is with surprise that he was discovered that the newly elected do not understand trés well known terms.
At least the they say.
"Who is valdemort."
"I don 't know really."
"I am a jeunôt in politics pragoise reacted lukas kaucky, the elected to culture to the test of vocabulary" godfather ."
And for what concerns the veteran politics, the elected karel brezina reacted to the same way.
For example, the sense of "hole gulf."
"It is the only expression among those that you proposez that i use"
Otherwise, i does not use the argôt.
The vocabulary, including the daily aktualne. cz has published the phrases in june of this year before the congrés pre - éĺectoral of the ods, the drafting chose 6 examples, in priority those who are associated with the municipality in prague.
The socialists to explain the sense of "voldemort," "the greatest hole gulf in prague," go to the patisserie, "" nerve beef, "" betrayal of the capital, "and" entôler. "
Three of elected have been agreed to a quiz, the quatrieme - antonin weinert, which should lead education in prague in the future - has promised first an interview but then did not managed the telephone.
The fifth elected petr dolinek has starkly refused the test.
"I don 't at all of these things here and how joke the representatives of democracy: i donnerai not my judgment citizen."
"I is the way we are we understand in the framework of our programs," will he responded.
As we have already course, the elected lukas kaucky agree not apparently in the legend above, that it comes to the influential janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor novel bem.
"Voldemort" said nothing á kaucky and the only expression that it has deviné in the test is "the biggest hole gulf in prague."
"It is the tunnel blanka" said kaucky and adds immediately: "but i know of newspapers."
"I will have to pay a course of language," he attractive does.
Not only the matador karel brezina, but also lukas plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the hole gulf is the tunnel as blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really voldemort and lukas plachy knows the place where find the figure - he believes in the sense of "go to the pâtisserie."
"It is, i believe, to go to a firm," plachy is ready to know that it is the siege societies of janousek.
On the same tone brezina reminds us that it at its knowledge rather of newspapers and not of any vocabulary that it will use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexique of argôt in social democracy.
"I recently took council with colleagues, and he would appear that we have not really something of this kind."
"We are told rather the names some time we use of abréviations and symbols," says peter hlinsky, president of the social - democratic party, that the party 's call hulda members.
"I called briza in school but i don 't know if my colleagues call me as, albeit karel brezina about nicknames.
The current daily. cz has tested the name, and it march.
The elected weinert is papy for members of the party or of the less friendly small old, the high representative miroslav, who has attracted the attention on him before the elections by the fraud during the party 's sponsoring, is dubbed "the small joujou."
The nicknames are also the only that accept employ within the party the social democrats.
It seems that hulinsky does not like many hulda, but the lives akutel. cz recorded another nickname for this pragois president.
"Doctor in law clubbed where they lay" reaffirms it is that petr hulinsky has achieved a doctor in judr law. in the academy of bratislava police.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorcières," has published a brochure.
The burkina faso, women sorcières have declared traits common.
Instead, they are part of the old generation, for example, cannot work for reasons of health, are free, and don 't have a child.
"Witch that becomes isolated" is not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has rarely this fate."
"You no longer judge not healthy young women because they participate in the work and deliver of children," says the sister might attest which deals in the capital of the west african countries, burkina faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this "social" unusual.
He published a brochure that should help has limit the witch.
The case has a "catch."
"More than 70% of adults burkina faso knows not read," warned the standard daily die about the inconvenience of education written.
The charge of sorcellerie is common in other countries in africa.
Ghana, neighbor to the burkina faso, ammy hemma, a woman of 72 is dead having been victimized by three women and a man and then scorched with oil that they had aspergé.
It is the bbc 's server who has received this information.
The criminals argue that it was the eye.
According to their version oil that serves the onctions rituals has emflammée in contact of the woman.
The oil has flambé, seems, when the team sought "chasing the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorcières" is supported by the people of all levels of education.
The standard daily of citait an entrepreneur of 42 burkina faso: "the mangeurs minds humans have always been a danger," he said.
While burkina faso seeks to reduce the witch, the gambia no later than the last year has even the president himself there.
"The president gambien dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad witch that, seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by the magic to kill also black president."
"Of the chamans guinea close to the rescue, have brought to the firm presidential kanilai, under the protection of police and the president 's personal guard, men and women randomly selected dansdes villages of gambia," said in a message the "amnesty international organization.
Has the closes people imprisoned should drink a nostrums basis of plants to hallucinogènes effects that provoquaient in more than other effects on the back and the gut.
Two prisoners are not survived.
On the international pressure it is about a thousand people who were called in freedom.
The or bakal: the poèles rent - chauffent, he signed a higher.
A man who imposing emerged by the door of the center patrons of society rpg byty of "baron coal" zdenek bakal, the biggest private owner of apartments to rent in the czech republic.
It was under the arms a issue with three new location contracts for three: his apartments, that of his daughter and his son who is entrain to purge a penalty.
The deregulation raised the rent to these three people.
Instead of pay 3,500 the son must address from the next year for an apartment 2 + 1 second category 4100 couronnes.
"And there has not hot water and heating works the solid fuel," points on the new contract to his son the man who has the power of signing.
"But i signed when even" explains does it to motié in anger and half resigned.
The association of apartments bytyokd citizen. cz that described the nouelles location conditions as "immoral and obscene," advises the government not to sign and wait until the december 7, when be released a notice for explain how to claim.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One saying that, the other says else" in fronçant eyebrows.
The region in ostrava becomes the laboratory to deregulation.
After the new year, it is what expects most apartment in the czech republic, which the rents stump is not at market prices.
Aktualne. cz for this reason, has decided to visit personally the "laboratory."
The room of rpg in the streets havirovska is one of the region of the four in ostrava and it is already fraught the mardi to 09. m.
Just side of the door stands a guard of a society with a security apparatus to call customers.
A "special," rent 2011, "is turned on on the tactile screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number fate of the apparatus.
You don 't have the time to read your number "157" that your number begins already illuminer on the great under the topit of the screen' s waiting room.
In a fraction of second your round.
After a short time, old couple comes to ask on the rent, but the new rents doesn 't involve people in the room pattern.
The majority of people came to address current problems as everywhere - demand to redress, events regarding insurance, and others.
In the region of ostrava, people more than 44000 apartments of portfolios of rpg recoivent letters with the new lease contracts in their boite in letters since about the mid - november.
Rpg byty their rent - proposes of increases in 15 to 38%.
The window for the new special rents is open to public since november 18.
"It works for nearly a week, it is still to the test" responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employed behind the window when the client presented as a reporter.
The déragulation and the former apartments of local miners of bakal are a subject very sensitive.
Vice - president of the parliament and fan in the region in ostrava lubomir zaoralek of social democrats in relatively supported before the election has state and local this fulfill now newspapers.
"20 years after them, i want a new floor."
"They have not even changed a could... are of working in the toilets themselves, are removed in introduction the man mentioned.
However, this are especially, according to the employees, retirees who come to be sure that they receive rebate on the new rent - price of if they sign now as has promised rpg in a special supply.
It is a rebate in half of the amount of rent that receive the other loctaires who have signed their new contract before the december 15.
But the window "deregulation" of the street havirovaska really isn 't burdened by the issues.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to the rent," indicates the employed the window.
Yet rpg porpose on its web site that in individual windows interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If both sides not concur on the rent it is an independent court, which will take the decision.
There is no threats but only to learn about the legitimate and unique way to act legally, "indicates rpg on its web site.
"Nobody ira in court" think one of the employed of rpg byty and the man in the streets to the center of customer gives reason.
"I 13000 couronnes pension and i remains 5,000 couronnes to eat, i have not enough to go to the tribunal," he said.
The employed feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will."
"Mr. zaoralek in the media demand that no one sign and thus the people expect," indicates does it.
Regulation rents ends in the czech republic with the onset of 2011, and the increases, according to rpg economic byty, are a necessity.
Moreover, "and the current rents are still not the level necessary for the fund 's interview simple to housing," pavel residential klimes, director of the portfolios of society rpg byty, that it is precisely the neglect of funds for housing that makes the or angry is the main reason of the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 rpg have with the rents invest in the apartments, 4 billion in four years of 2011 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The great hung screen of ceiling in front of fauteuils rembourrés of the room of the streets havirosvka, red repeats nonetheless some information shown by.
Is the increase in rent in 2011 is of 15%, and is no less than 31200 apartments more than 90% of apartments of rpg. "
"And it is still in more 7.50 couronnes czechs the square meters per month," indicates the screen.
The increase in 38% is that 400 apartments the portfolios of rpg.
"In these cases, there is an increase of a sum really very low 19.66 couronnes czechs the standard," adds rpg.
The next year the rent remain the same for 2.6 apartments.
Rpg byty promises that deregulation will lead not a radical increase but progressive about 4 to 8 years.
She adds to other commitments: all the money of the increase in rent (see. the graphe) is made to flats in the form of economies heating - new windows and heating.
Those who signed the agreement on the rise of rent have the priority.
Maternal school, too, is part of the offices have understood the architects.
The construction avriopoint of brno is the new administrative siege of society arch. design.
Nobody could have also expect that it contains a mini maternal school with all that he must - walls of colors, furniture imaginatifs, toys and finally a ground of games miniature on the terrasse.
Since october of last year, can will make the children of employed arch. design.
Society of projects - architectonique arch. design. whose the sessions have produced a large number of construction to brno, has devised its corporate maternal mini school since the first ébauches of construction avriopoint.
It employs roughly 90 people, especially of the age children and to make it mattered that women architects and heads of projects can quickly return to work.
At the same time that of employment contracts to maternal time declined, the school is a bonus offered his employees by society arch. design. in the framework of its social agenda.
The builders, and architects and the possibility of an alliance a job taking with the care for the children.
These are the employees of arch. design. themselves who have imagined this school maternal and with the backing of leadership they could get a him of the european union and the ministry of labor, and social affairs.
The mini maternal school is financed by the capacity of the european social funds through program operational human resources and the czech republic 's state budget.
With the endowments of financing ($2.8 mil. couronnes czechs). they could buy equipment and equipment and two years after ensure a staff as well as the establishment.
After the use of the him of financing (two years) society arch. design. has the obligation after 3 years to sustain the maternal mini school on its own fund.
The run - project lasted a year and it is the economy ratings society that helped to do the demand for him.
The care to children is secured by a staff, all day a nurse and institutrice of maternal take care of children. maternal children can go to school without limit of age but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini - school maternal" there can be that 5 children present at the same time, but over the day there are more who replace.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children all employees have the same right to use this school without look at the hierarchical position.
Although it agise of a individual care and education, the maternal mini school program is comparable to those for education préscolaire.
The children are are not only play but a teaching is also secured - of the early until the preparation to shoals of school are teaching english.
The class is equipped not only of toys and imaginatifs but also of a computer games that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any moment their child control and not have the stress of a backlog to look children in a school of the workplace of parents.
So the parents use their time to work of the more productive way.
It is not surprising that develops a natural of loyalty relationship between the employee and employer.
Arch. design. thus place among the companies that provide a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees, and that are friendly to family and through this strengthens the marketing of rh program.
The house in bone fascinates even after 100 years. jetez an eye in the domestic gaudi.
The toît looks at the back of one saurien préhistorique, the escalier to a backbone of dinosaure and the balcons to gueules of fish open.
This is how is the house casa battlo barcelona of the architect antoni gaudi.
Because of its forms organic, the house received the share of local the nickname homes in bone.
Organic, wild colors, use unusual forms of stones, fragments carreaux and mosaîque, façade recalling écailles and everywhere present trends, this is what is ypique for the art again to antoni gaudi.
The head of the house façade place its lines of dream, color and textures agreeable who recall the nature and animals.
In a detailed observation more one sees the geometry, the pace and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is allumée of such a way that the impression of brillance of colors is strengthened.
The enroulement and the torsion forms also appears in the domestic with the same extent.
Firewood copy in executives of windows, the balustrades waves, things décoratifs doorstep, the oeilleton and the lamelles.
The house battlo who is pits in the neighborhood eixample in the streets market passeig gracia in the number. 43, is born of the construction of a house of 1877 the architect emilio sala cortes.
The reconstruction has made for two years and the house over in 1906.
The investor, joseph battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another any new but soon accepted the idea of gaudi of a reconstruction unusual and better market.
But the idea of casa battlo as house in housing multiple was not thinking by gaudi alone.
The architect josep maria jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on her project that are born the décorations for an apartment of representation the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the façade.
For the façade have also worked for other artists and creators.
The common work to the plans of the house casa battlo began by to succés between jujol and gaudi cooperation.
Jujol has participated in the construction of the house of gaudi casa mila and the park guell in which there are other, gaudi pursuits.
The local have dubbed the home to warm just after its finition organic "because of its forms the homes in bone."
Other, had the specific mechanism to open up windows have called "the house, which baille."
It is said that the top of the construction there is a sword similar to the st george boss of the catalogne.
Other elements of image of the construction contain hidden motives religious.
Gaudi has thought to the house a single system in its time of the central heating, with évents typical of aération and cheminées.
Their capacity of 45 degrees seems bizarre.
Over the creation gaudi has absolutely not respected the construction of then directives and did not let impede by them.
At the beginning of the construction he has achieved on the part of the city the helped to build, knowing, of course, the data went on the plans for reconstruction were so vague that two years after during the finition the city council was horrified and asked the changes.
He fancied not, for example, the members of the city council pillars of the construction empiettent on the trottoir public.
There was never change, but, instead only 15 days after the call of the city josep battlo asked (and earned satisfaction) the authority of laud the two top shelves.
The owner moved to lower shelves.
In the common grandstanding in the second tier there was a living room and third in a house and private part of the apartment.
The rez - chaussée was leased to a bijouterie.
The whole house of six shelves is shared by a escalier by that we enjoy until a terrasse independent toît.
All angles rights and the lines droites were forgiven by basic elements of reconstruction and their substitution by walls curve.
Gaudi modern travailla also the concept of linking of spaces.
The common part can be cell relates completely by opening the doors of cozy and high society can communicate comfortably or well be limit private space for interviews more intimate.
The house with the reconstruction of gaudi received in addition to new facades an toîture not traditional and two shelves.
The hands of gaudi with light is also impressive, tuiles vitrées blue and white with which is décorée domestic court and the wells of enlightenment.
The game on two colors gives a maximum of light in all the shelves of the house.
It simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than the dark that instead absorbs sunlight.
The house casa battlo that has been enshrined in 2005 into the global wealth funds, unesco may be visitée by each.
The house lies in the first tier the apartment the most spacieux and splendid accessible to the public.
The owners were determined to cross this not in 2002 to the occasion of the 150ème anniversary of the birth of famous creator.
They have continued visits because they saw that it is a lucrative business and they have enlarged visits to the common spaces and the attic including the of toît.
The entry invitation to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups, and holders of cards tourism have 20% of cheap.
The sum is when even above the prices of gaudi entry into the other construction in the city.
If you want to feel the atmosphere real of the house with his tourelles fantastic, you must quickly find a comrade among residents of the building and visit completely the house.
How choose a cushion and a sommier: women have other criteria that men.
Not seen a framework, but rather the quality of the surface restricted in setting, so the mattress and the sommier give a real basis for a good bed.
They must be well, of course harmonieusement to please a user concrete.
During the many things are account, choice: the weight, the size, the age, the state of health, as well that the owner 's sex.
The kind of interior in which we will put the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the campaign home where one lies not continually the mattress in appropriate latex are not because they are "heat" slowly.
They have, moreover, a burden than the mattress in polyuréthane standards.
It is necessary to the return frequently.
If they did not also enough distribution channels at the heart and if they remain, in addition, with a solid printing, they get the moisture. moisissure can also is form.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The time passing the clear abroad where we use frequently mattress very thick with a loaf rammollissante, feel difficult well on the surface low, and hard.
"It is so that the hokeyistes return of nhl complain that they can 't sleeping there."
"To their shoulders fed up, the feet and the coast, they needed to cushion with a loaf rammollisante of mousse paresseuse."
"Such mattress are also recommandés for people who suffer from diabetes and thus have a disorder of nervous system that take the evil" information "of the skin," articulations and explains sylva adamczikova which specializes in the furniture rembourrés.
It is for this that a few years ago the mattress with mousse paresseuse has gained the hokeyistes as well as other customers.
"Today all works well, tempur, the italian magnifex but also the czech tropico for example, have adequate mattress.
You don 't need to be a guy nhl to power appreciate a mousse paresseuse.
This "miracle" works.
It optimalise its rigidity and form according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing put pressure on you and you don 't retournerez in the night as after a difficult game.
You dormez simply better.
The mousse paresseuse works also as protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress, depending on your size, combine the length of the feet, or about 21 / 34 centimeters.
A man and a woman 's size of 180cm have need a bed of 210 / 220 centimeters.
The largeur minimal for each bed to two places should be 90 centimeters is in any 180 centimeters.
For the singles beds in one place, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 centimeters.
It is commode in case of visit.
The but it is a simple rule for the largeur the bed: when you are couché on the back you should ask the hands of a comfortable with the chatter slightly pliés. helena prokopova, president of the association of bourreliers - matelassiers and décorateurs dedicated for several years to the problematic of a healthy sleep and to the mobilier 's ergonomie and taught in schools expertise.
For a bed to two places each needs of his own sommier and cushion, thus attention however during the achât of well choose the scale of mattress.
Otherwise it only you will remain in the sommier at different levels, and this is unachievable on all executives of bed.
The mattress mousse should have a minimal of 14 centimeters, the mattress to springs at least 15 centimeters, this matter to the stratospheric form of and aération at least three centimeters.
"To reach or in a position base on the mattress you have not feel the springs," warned héléna prokopova.
Each mattress demand a type of determined to sommier.
The bed - sommier, when the mattress and the united sommier are as daughters siamoises, did nothing to do in the chambers to fold.
The mattress aèrent badly; we should not the land, which is commonly auhourd.
And, since during the night you transpire normally of 0.2 0.75 the sueur it is clear that after 5 - 7 years, the mattress begins to remind a great (and clogged) tamis.
To this scholars refuse to make the want on a life of 25 years for a cushion or a guarantee for life.
But to its but.
And for this a council 's experience of the share of sellers: for a cushion for 120 / 140cm, renoncez, to revêtement of cushion, the hygiene or to washing but combine rather a cushion of protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make of revêtements with closure glissière to all the whole, it is to say that after the opening it has two parties (for the washing, and the size of the washing machine it is very important!), or the manipulation of the big models (and for a single person) becomes when out a battle between a burden slight and heavyweight on a ring.
You in your bed a printing rigid instead of a sommier?
Never!
Maximum a bed tell visitors for a overnight.
However équipez printing (if it has not) holes of aération and use the mattress springs with a minimal of 15cm with springs in sachets (germany taschenfederken) and a aération layer.
A cushion in polyuréthane should not be part of such a bed.
For the sommiers to lamelles unique position with 14 / 18 lamelles, the mattress in latex or called sandwichs (perhaps the combination of raw cashew latex and coco), is the ideal, but it will always be better for you have a cushion with more lamelles, 28, and above, where lamelles are doubled in the part of the low kidneys and that so it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
To the mattress positions it should not be taken to cushion to springs because it does not address the changes stance.
Has side of the settling of lamelles rigidities we can settle also what economists call a cradle of secrecy.
It is a special linking of lamelles that allows to pressure or even bow the lamelle for the back of dormeur "integrates" well.
For the men who have "the shoulders as large as the backs," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already envisaged by manufacturers cushion that for the "male" have started to use a zone rammollissante at the level of shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer again surface more slowing the level of hanches.
The most difficult for the client there are sommiers to wings or platelet with what economists call a suspension multiforce.
The pressure will dissémine in more percentage points, and diinue the tension.
But of course, attention, whenever you use a bad oreiller (great and gouging of air) on the right cushion and sommier, "the more" disparait.
The basic rule is a oreiller simple: the oreiller should support the heads and his pointed must reach only the shoulders, for the muscles of shoulders to rely.
The size advocated is 50x60 centimeters that the scandinavian by exmple prefer.
When one is lying on the side, the oreiller must to level (with the birthplace of secrecy sommier or zone rammollie up in the mattress) the shoulders.
The modern mattress still have something common with the first to basis of straw and grasses.
Manufacturers use still or natural materials many entanglements.
The trend is also a cushion organic.
The basis of pétrôle raw materials, from which they makes the polyuréthane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all producers known use precisely soybeans.
"The kindest organic for the mattress means that the heart of - based are manufactured products natural," petr vasicek of society tropico more.
The natural materials are used also for the revêtements mattress; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro - capsules that develop perfume the forest or lavande.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the abstract of plants of bouleau for the revêtement of cushion absorbs heat and refroidisse the human body, "censorship," the revêtements "chauffent" women.
The abstract of poivre red accelerates the blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current preferred?
The cold cushion made from mousse (it has more pores with a cell roiled therefore more respirante structure that the standard polyuréthane and has more élasticité.
The combination of different rigidities of foam dry provides cushion polyzones who know precisely where is the head, the low the back and the feet.
You paierez a cushion to quality from 7,000 couronnes and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health have less than vat and are taken as instruments for health.
In the czech republic, it is gumotex who has reached the first place.
Economiser for the mattress and the sommier is not easy.
You can time to time have in the framework of special actions, the proportion of manufacturers or producers two cushion for the price of one.
Like the magniflex society that provide a cushion duofreeze with mousse to memory memory cousue for revêtement for 11990 couronnes.
Is, of course take the second free.
The era of foam lazy or viscoélastiques with a cell structure open and a great width has been démarrée with it tempur at a pace "cosmic."
This has begun as it comes to nasa parceque the astronauts have suffered from the start of factors load enormous.
The tempur is rammollit to heat and durcit, on the contrary, the cold.
Thus, it adapts perfectly at the human body hot and distributing optimal pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil dormi and for a increase of comfort during the sleep.
The foam viscoélastiques use not only for the mattress, but also for the products for health, as the special buffers for the feet that alleviate the legs and the veineux system.
The czech manufacturers use by, say, mousse eucathermc or twinsaver or the same type.
The equipment to follow the people are increasingly demanded by parents who wish to monitor their children.
The fear for their child brings more and more people to think to watch them through a tankers.
The system, put in place to start to look for cars can also be used to chart the movement of people and help in some cases like by exmple the small anicka janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a boite lightly 's matches but will soon be of the size of a shows.
The case of the small anicka has profoundly moved a large number of people, and they began to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to confuse their private lives.
"We are seeking to tell all that it is not of espionage, but only of another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says petr pilin of the macro past society that is one of traçage suppliers of devices on the czech market.
"I admit that there can be the case of bad employment such devices, for example put him in the bag of a person who is not the current, but i have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for reasons of security, adds pilin.
According to him children should always know what purposes is used the "boite" and how the use in emergencies.
The psychologist for children, dana bockova, attracts the attention that if the child did not want to focus on him a thing of this kind, it débarassera.
, And even the most small can show a great creativity when it comes to get rid exprès something when they do not want to be under control. "
"Cell phones, which can cut off as these devices traçage, have already brought parents to long expectations," says bockova.
According to it, the fact that this kind of apparatus can help in case of aggression is very dubious.
"If it is a seizure prepared, the author will do everything to the child did not of electronic apparatus that can the locate."
"Now, it is the telephone."
"Whenever will develop the appareillages of traçage, they (criminals) will seek too because the sale will be backed by a campaign advertising."
"In such cases the criminals will always be in advance on the police," said the psychologist.
Even so, it admits that such devices can help in aggression not prepared by a pédophile.
According to robert cech of society rc monitoring, which provide a traçage services for automobiles that for the people, says that of this type of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of aggression.
The "can be paramétré apparatus of such a way that it is in regular - after a period determined."
"In the case where apparatus is destroyed, it remains anyone of even the last position of the relevant."
Will the equipment more expensive have also a inclinomètre that reports immediately the position of the person who has shifted and finds itself in a position allongée without moving, "indicates cech.
According to him cell phones physical intelligent that are equipped with a system of navigation, can offer a comparable after the service have formaté with a special prologiciel.
The problem of current traçage systems is that it is either a apparatus similar to those that the one in pendentif lightly of the size of a boite which matches or to smaller telephone equipment.
We can always the lose.
According to the society pilina macro past, this is why the tests are conducted to make common equipment that look like digital montres.
"It will the advantage that the potential aggressor can not recognize the traçage apparatus."
"Or well it report after a time, which will be given to the police a bit more time," it added.
That the traçage apparatus is developed in the form of bracelet or pendentif, it utilisiera always the same technology that to chart cars.
It is a combination of systems of acquisition of a middle position of tankers (which is used routinely by autonavigation) and a function of a cell phone that alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many cordeaux détonants that it could do the round of the czech republic with. but it cannot fulfill that two years.
The army has bought for 445 kilometers of cordeaux used for the explosives.
Already last year the department of defense in had bought 224 kilometers.
The army has thus reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of cordeaux is of two to four years maximum.
The army has bought cordeaux détonants to society stv group to 40 million couronnes anonymous.
The major general - state has given as reason to the achât an enormous amount of cordeaux détonants to mf dnes that soldiers in use 60 kilometers per year.
According to reserve to hold calculations made by the pyrotechniciens of the army, that mf dnes has used, it shows that even the generals officers, with a command, secretaries or the personal of each year an exercise should have the household explosives.
Alexander vondra, and defense minister vlastimil picek, army commander was no exception.
Only to argue annual consumption of the army 60 kilometers cordeaux détonants.
This distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reserves of the army could provide for 10 years ago.
If, instead, it would be true that for the basis of each new professional training it enough in more than 2 mr cordeaux détonants, as the experts argue, this means that the army with its new purchase has secured - also the consumption of special units, and the genie - reserves to the 225 years mentioned.
But the troops from the brigade of rapid intervention have recently complained the minister vondra that they did almost no ammunition for their weapons of poing and that the sessions of shooting are limited, owing to the needs of money.
Has relation to the lack of piling bodies are not speak.
"And i don 't take the lead me if they buy among we a large quantities of cordeaux détonants."
"And it is their decision, and they know really what they do."
"To the army is a good that we work as client that traders of content," said the director of stv group jan decky trade.
Jan pejsek, department of defense spokesman, argues achât of hundreds of kilometers cordeaux détonants by the fact that the army will be these "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan decky of stv group reported however of only four years of life of cordeaux détonants and the pyrotechniciens of the police and the army of just two years.
"If they are perfectly entreposés in deposits, it can go even until four years," said one, two that does not that his name is published had respect to criticism of the army.
The delay of life past, every munition should be tested to see if it remains assimilates and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
But these tests are not free and cost the money.
The other argument of ministry is an cheap due to the quantity to 445 kilometers cordeux détonants.
"They we have cost 60% of less than the supply of the last year of 245 kilometers," indicates the speaker pejsek that is the interprets according buyers department of defense.
Only to compare: annual consumption of cordeaux détonants pyrotechniciens of police that counteract the ammunition of world war ii or those after the soviet military, doesn 't exceed the 1500 meters.
And the police command always only the quantity of munitions required to be used before the end of their duration of life.
This has been established for reasons of pyrotechniciens and security for power in more get more flexible of the kinds of cordeaux détonants newer and more reliable.
The defense ministry has now of big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of munitions from the time of the warsaw pact czechoslovakia when the army 's strong two hundred thousand men is preparing to move, on the rhine course.
What waits in recent years this czech army that mf dnes has used: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old cordeaux détonants that it buys today "to cheap."
Until now i is profiting from contacts that i gains from contest.
The sale under his hotel 's bluntness well helped lukas pytloun for the place of individual winner of the contest best entrepreneur.
The winner of the contest of individual best entrepreneur for the past year has been lukas pytloun, entrepreneur 28 - year.
His to the succés adventure is like in a movie.
Lukas pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, it is realized that to libérec he lacked a host quality site at a reasonable price.
From its economies on what he had won when he working abroad and with the help of lending banking he has bought a small building of 5 apartments to half demolished.
Knowing that it was still student in trosième year of higher education, it was a brave action.
"The report between the quality and the price of a housing sites in our region gave me want to do something," says lucas pytloun.
It has laud the first apartment rebuilt on foreign workers.
It réinvestit benefit in the building that he transformed in pension with 54 beds.
Since then, its action of entrepreneur has helped to open to libérec 4 thought, two restaurants style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all types of housing sites.
The more comfortable of them was until just recently the four stars pytloun design hotel.
This year it happened another of quality identical.
"We have just to sign a contract with a hotel in ostrova u tise where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates in the franchise pytloun hotels have demonstrated," the number 1 of entrepreneurs of the last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the functioning of a hotel large - scale victory to contest the entrepreneur of the year has served, well adds pytloun with recognition.
The victory has provided more popularity and to be known to libérec and its around.
"People recognize in the streets, congratulated me often and me, i say, that it was very attractive," he.
It recommends participation in this contest to all those who are trying to do something.
This is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
It says that it uses until now their contacts and knowledge that he would not be able to get of another way.
"With those that i met by the admissions i began to run commercial relations regularly.
According to him, the rest linked in the succés has also had an impact on the workers.
And he about 70.
"I observed home especially the pride and loyalty to be committed to something that has been in general recognized."
"It is not, and by far, the only result of my work, but the result of a good we work together.
"Just my name is pushed forward," said lucas pytloun with modesty.
I wish to my successor better year than we had to farmet.
The euphoria of the victory has been rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With the sense of the goal of winner farmet has the worst behind so.
That is ripe seek the price to slovansky dum for the first place on the contest to the firm of the year organized by vodaphone last year is karel zdarsky the owner of society farmet.
The jury rewarded efforts with which he has transformed a workshop of outillage to ceska skalice a company in the business of 100 million couronnes figure.
As i can say that the award has encouraged not only me my also my collaborators and has increased our confidence in itself to combat the competition, "says today the winner of the contest last year.
The beginning of the story of society farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of karel zdrasky laud the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the communists, it has not hesitated long, has refused a career in a firm where he worked at the same time, and has created a society with a few comrades in his father 's entourage who plastic for the manufacture of baignoires in.
Not long after they began to specializing in the presses for vegetable oils.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of presses machines in central europe.
Society has been known even in the public not specialist after the succés achieved the admissions through the media.
"Not only our clients have begun to really better know the marks farmet but also foreign partners that have begun to realize that they collaboraient with a society that has achieved the greatest succés in his country of origin," karel zdarsky says.
But the last year 's e has not gone to farmet only ldans euphoria of victory.
The assessment of society had been made from the economic performance in 2008 and 2009 in part.
And precisely in 2009, the year the more difficult for the sale of machinery engineering.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affected citizens, and societies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new material and technologies.
"We have not escaped course to this situation."
"The numbers business fell to 40%, and we dûmes limit our production and even downsize," karel zdarsky.
A viable must know that time society in time it takes take unpopular steps.
But they have handled the situation properly and have retained lower results bénéficiares even if they were those that they had before the crisis.
However, in farmet, they have continued compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with the endowments a center of training, and research, have reinforced the presentation of society in cozy - exhibits international and won the major rewards in the national exhibits," said zdarsky.
All we suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affires back and with them the number of employees also.
"In the new winner i wish this sense pleasant but victory in the atmosphere calm," karel zdarsky says.
The investigation that suppresses regulations crazy.
The investigation into the absurdity of the year is for the fourth a part of the clan business.
Some absurd regulations have been eliminated.
The little glorious winner of this year of the investigation into the absurdity of the year has been the obligation to bring in the offices of documents that officials can get one - line.
More than a third of 4,000 voters have voted for this.
For example, the administrations of social affairs play asked an abstract paper in the trade as the official can get into two clicks with mice.
It changes through investigation.
"The czech administration of the social insurance will require more extracted from set trade controls of the insurance payments," has indicated jana buranova czech, speaker of the administration of the social insurance (cssz).
To emphasize all the rules and decrees that societies and entrepreneurs must fill in the czech republic and do remove those that are absurd is the sense of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
The survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the clan business organized by hospodarske noviny and still has a greater popularity.
If the 3,000 voters stood last year, it is at least 4,000 this year that brought their voice.
This is not surprising, there are too in our country are the more diverse legal obligations that rein in the company, and, this, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to fill for fiscal statements on the top ranks in the world," says karel havlicek of the association of small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs to the czech republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world better the situation in the czech republic does not at all.
According to the world bank the czech republic lies in 74 expected place for what is the conditions for the company, either 8 squares of more relative to the last year.
The contest the absurdity of the year was put in place for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
No matter who can do state every year nonsense and administrative bureaucracies of april end of last september, delay before the closure of the contest.
To realize there are too the web site www. firmaroku. cz. second, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and leaves the public vote for the october on www. firmaroku. cz / absurdita and on www. ihned. cz.
The absurdity who received the largest number of votes has declared the winner.
Until the latest survey of last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 10.5 rules and décrêts that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs, but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the contest, so among the nominees is by example vehicles the requirement that the maintenance of highways, and fast lines pay the tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, repeignent two offices, and two bathrooms every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the site of contest.
The proclamation of contest, which still in early november on wenceslas square in prague, is a part of a happening which participate regularly figures from political and public life.
This year, for example, evo svobodova, director of the association for small and medium - sized companies czech republic, or petr kuzel, president of the house trade of the czech republic, have watched at a time climax the contest.
'S economic prosperity cannot function when the state pointing of âtons in the legs entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozens of paragraphs now only complicate the company, "to martin kocourek said, the minister of the trade and industry.
The effort to suppress décrêts absurd is not a coup sword in the water.
In 2007, which fancied not to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for individual enterprise to the place where is the corporation, the intent to go to an exhibition or a pélerinage with stand.
This requirement was suppressed with the ammendement the law of individual enterprise.
The second requirement plébiscitée in 2007, which was declare the office of work a trip to an employee foreign service on 30 days, has been suppressed with the text of law on what we call the green card.
And all is ok until the third session of the contest.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the décrêt for the physical to have a great mirror in their, a refrigerator cabinet and two current machines.
This has been changed by prescription of last year 's ministry of health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been suppressed.
A new category reward firms officials socially.
Are evaluated the ecological projects, humanitarian, training, or even sports.
The novelty of this year 's contest hospodarske noviny, which already exists five years since, is the group called the firm responsible for 2010.
The onjectif of this contest is support to the company reasonable and fair.
"We want to support the societies that oversee the impact of their firm on the environment and lead a responsible activity socially," indicates patrick bartholdy, the manager of regional operator of cell phone, the firm vodaphone, which is the guarantor and project of this contest, as in the case of contest to the rebel of the year.
For the first year of this under - category of contest the firm of 2010, organized by the vodaphone firm, have registered societies that have not succés with a single purpose long - term to the firm.
The each adventure is rich of aspirations, and an independent article would be éditer.
Although the subject of their different company is one of the other you might consider their activity support and projection as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, it is the personal persons with disabilities and the problems or health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for all the czech republic lies not example society of prologiciels pragoise and netera that supports the creation of sports teams informal their employees who then to many tournaments in different disciplines sport.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of pardubice is the isolit - hurrah society that is since 17 years the main contributor to endowment that sponsors children with disabilities.
The to address employees with health problems, the old are still can name of paper podebrad that manufacturing plant in employs more than 70% and who, for it, has achieved the title of the central bohême responsible for the region and firm that has placed third in the region in front of the year of the firm organized by vodaphone.
Has olomouc, it is miryz soft, a financial society, which won for introduced hours of labor relaxed, and even to fall until 35 hours per week on average, and that, without, proportionellement, decrease in pay.
The jury him déverné the title also because it achête priority in manufacturers czechs, supports a ditoyenne in the closest entourage activity and cares about the environment.
"We are seeking to more possible for recycling that our corporate activity and administration have the least impact on the environment," miluse ryznarova, the executive director of society.
Society in charge it enlogit of the region usti also believe in the health of its employees and their has put in place for every laptop a chair and a keyboard ergonomiques, encourages their jobs at home and uses the services of catering of a local factory protected to its actions.
Moreover, "we support the foundation man in the shadow who help the local community roma," said ondrej suchy the high representative of society.
The last rank, also for its activities, a society of washing and cleansing in the region to karlovy vary, which contributed to the insurance retreat from its workers in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society, we help food, transport, the increase of qualifications and their leisure," says joseph strapac society of construction of bruntal czasch, winner for the moravie - silésie region.
Are registered automatically in the category society responsible, all the finalists regional for contest the firm of the year of vodaphone, who had responded in questionnaires in room for the document attached to the inscription and had removed to the organizer before the august 15.
The answers evil met or incomplete in questionnaires were withdraw the aided by the organizer.

The fund to the land to plzen, the police has process of arrests in a contest public
In the construction of funds for land to plzen anti - corruption, the police has process of arrests in recent days.
The détectives spent away the entrepreneur local housing and storeowner in lubos. g.
It had tried to manipulate precisely a call of public bids for the settlement of a demand for restitution of such a way that the ground proposed is obtained by a candidate determined.
It should pay to lubos g. a half million couronnes.
"For now i can only confirm that the police pursues a person to insider trading in the framework of a call of offers and a public concour." said for the newspaper pravo the chief prosecutor of plzen antonie zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations for the investigation is underway.
The police have recovered after 24 hours this entrepreneur 46 years in freedom.
To know how it can influence a contest public, one can only speculate had respect the official so little of information.
Has a question of pravo, the speaker of the land lubomira funds cerna has indicated that the police had really process to an arrest plzen on a separate workplace, and that, over the public contest.
"It came to a client and in no case of a employee, she said.
The contest public according to cerna has as true name "to offer rights call for the transfer of land according to the earth" law, and is implemented when display several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people, in the framework of the appeal, offer a superior value of their rights to resitutions that must be solved before or announced the value of the ground."
"According to the rights proposed a rankings of homeowners is implemented and the land transfers funds then ground to the person who has proposed the highest" rights, told the fund 's spokesman.
Lubos g., had, it is clear, information about the people who were registered to the call and as he himself, also, one bénéficiare because has bought a large number of restitutions rights, he proposed the candidates for the ground not to participate in the contest.
And it encaissait possibly by the retreat.
What explains why he had so much money in her possession at the time of its interpellation.
Lubos contacts g. had beyond standards of the fdt (land funds).
It was in the case of the ex - head of the fdt vaclav sankot that was pursued the criminal for éditer land to which we had already published the decision to implement a construction.
Precisely lubos g. had achieved by public example of land for the construction of communications, concretely in place where must be built the artère of accés to industrial zone of borske polar.
Later it échangea with the municipality to a historical construction in the center of the city whose value is very far higher.
The municipality was forced to accept because otherwise it is bound to stop the construction jeopardized by a freeze on land.
Households will pay more than a hundred couronnes mensuellement for housing.
Households from january will need to pay overcollateralization not only for all kinds of energy, but also to water and sanitation, the supplies of heating and in some places the rents increase also.
Families will thus from january from their wallets until a hundred couronnes mensuellement more than now.
The electricity increases 4.6%, the gas nearly 2% more expensive, in some localities you devrez pay up to one - tenth of more the supply of water and in many places the central supplies of heating will also be more expensive.
The increase in the electricity should be to households in apartment 100 couronnes anuellement more than now.
But all suppliers have decreased the price of electricity given development sensitive to encourage the manufacturing of renewable energy, including solar cells.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people in the most need for heat and therefore the greatest consumption.
So it is also a hundred of couronnes.
Although the electricity, and gas increase in the czech republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
This are mostly great common that planning rising prices.
For example households to pardubice or hradec kraloce pay to count for january for heating central almost 50 couronnes more per month, the libérec families pay more than 1,000 couronnes annually.
For inhabitants in prague prepares for an increase of 9% for water and sanitation for the cases where the city increases rents infrastructure.
If the rents not change the pragois exact an extra 6.8%.
The price in prague will still part of the lowest in comparison with the country as a whole.
In north bohême, where prices are already part of higher, water and sanitation increase of 7.4%.
The rents prices will rise by example markedly in the 450 thousand apartments in location from january it is to say about the end of regulation.
For example, the icc byty society that has to usti nad labem almost 2500 apartments, decided rising until to 100%.
Those that are not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the court by society.
The rents regulated that pay people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year 10%.
The czech children will saoûlent in rhum and the fernet. the beer is no longer fashion and is slowly.
The fernet, the rhum, the vodka and exceptional also the best marks whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that bring the most often those who saoûlent fifteen years, which have not yet, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital to backsliding are not the exception.
This result of the experience of doctors that meet cases akin to admissions of departments children hospitals.
"Bières or the wines are more of fashion, because it takes time to be saoûl."
All the trend is really to alcools strong, "indicates to pravo ludek pelikan, leader of the department children of the horovice hospital in central bohême.
"When they do to chiper a bottle daddy in the bed, it is sometimes of wisky but it is the fernet and the vodka that prevail.
"The vodka has this advantage that they can merge with the fortified tropicana juices of fruit and thus do not feel," explains the leader of department.
Evo jurinova, hospital spokesman motol gives it also reason.
"In general, it is the rhum, or the fernet."
"It is now alcohol fashionable especially in the elementary schools."
"In some cases, it came to slivovice that they brought to the house," has added jurinova.
According to the head of pélikan department, see drunken children aged thirteen fourteen years to admissions to the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before work to horovice since last year, it was to motol where it exerça ten years precisely in pédiatrie where ambulances amenaient of schoolchildren large around completely drunken.
"As a girl was hospitalisée four times
"It acommencé his career to twelve years when it has been transported with 3.5 per thousand alcohol dansle blood with in more a mixture of the extasy," described the doctor this case especially important.
"It was in the park displays of holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting, it is that it appeared not bizarre to the mother that his daughter is absent 48 hours" says amazed the head of the department.
It is precisely the neglect of parents or their tolerance outside the common against the fact that their repudiate engaged in the who are the main cause of the développment of drink alcoholism children.
According to scholars, you don 't publicize however the dependence, in his strict sense, for children.
"Chronic under the term an alcoholic we hear an addiction to alcohol of several years with all phenomena that accompany them but that you don 't recoup among children."
"Among those who use the acool to repeat, it is rather a family back - ground socio - dramatically unfavorably," explained the head of pélikan department.
According to the jurinova spokesman, about four children drunken have been hospitalized this year until the mid - november in the clinical pédiatrie to motol.
Are integrated in the stastistiques that the case with a grâve poisoning requiring the hospitalization.
The drunken children who are after the emergency care carried at home by parents or by the police, are not numbered.
In addition to the case of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, it exsite according to pélikan three waves saisonnières with which can count: the day of sorcières, the st sylvestre school - and the end of the year.
"They drink by despite after bad results instead they celebrating the early vacations."
Of course, "i lived to the day of sorcières a admission of 7 children drunken in one fell swoop," has emphasized pélikan.
The child ivre who has spent the night hospital in désintoxciation under control is paradoxically medical in a better position that is returned home and suffers the aftermath of the "hangover."
The ills of leader of the morning caused by deadly and a lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutrient elements whose organism needs.
"They are to better off because they spend an excellent evening then a soft awakening and nothing their own evil."
"They are only astonished to the place where they find themselves," adds pélikan knowing that of time this wastes the mood patients in at least with note to pay for their health care.
The transport by ambulance and hospitalization on bed of intensive care can go until tens of thousands of couronnes.
"Of time, i implemented in this as a means of education accounting to these children how their delight has cost and that they could spend the summer in work saisonnier to repay one evening," chirped pélikan.
But, according to him, insurance companies of health in their management in reverse, which should get from parents burdens connected to care, treat not the case of children drunken.
Two had the - 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in spain.
Two had the - 159 five in all, against which the defense ministry has exchanged casa it - 295m transport aircraft, have décollé mardi for seville in spain, which seat the manufacturer of airplanes casa - eads.
This is the first time that such devices become the property of someone else than czech the army.
But they have been abroad in the framework of exercises or flights demonstration of.
It comes to biplaces versions of the - 159t1 that were until now in use in the czech and that were army in state of flying.
Lestrois appliances remaining are versions monoplaces from the - 159.
Those - stationnent for the moment in aéro vodochody and the international trade - the omnipol - the took into account the firm last week.
According to press jan department 's pejsek department of defense, the departure physical vodochody aircraft is for the moment unknown.
Airplanes the - 159 monoplaces' s planned for the trade have been taken on had stored since long without that this would cause of or investment additional burdens for the defense ministry. "
"The biplaces the - 159 t1 have been exchanged in the state," said to pravo pejsek.
It has jouté that the army will remain without biplace since the ministry has signed with aéro in may 2009 vodochody agreement by a value of couronnes 200 million for the transformation of four monoplaces the - 159 untouched in two biplaces.
The army has taken delivery of primary apparatus in july, the second are expected to the delivery at the end of this year.
According to pejsek eads has committed itself to introduce airplanes in equipment in some countries of the alliance.
"In the contract it is clear that airplanes the - 159 entertain is eads and that they go to the training pilots of member countries of nato."
"It is therefore the case of that that takes into account of how realize it," has indicated pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the spanish army is not interested in the the - 159.
The return of five the - 159 for an aircraft casa and the purchase of three other had to 3.5 billion couronnes has been entérinée last year by the government of mirek topomanek.
The defense ministry did not launched appeal of offers and has used directly eads.
The direction of defense argued that the future of the trade assures a export - 159 abroad.
The czech army has bought to aéro vodochody 72 equipment and uses that 24, appearing to sell the rest.
The purchase of airplanes casa will probably judicial implications.
Yet the european commission has focused complaints against the czech department of defense from the european court of justice because airplanes have had to be drawn into the framework of a call of european offers to the scale and in no used directly a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three had casa, the last should happen on the airport in prague kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the annulaire is a sign of risk low of cancer
The men who have the index longer than the annulaire are exposed to a lesser to have a cancer the risk prostate.
It is the conclusion surprising of a study published wednesday by the british magazine cancer.
This can depend on the level of the hormone male the testostérone.
"Our conclusions show that the length relative finger at serves as a simple risk of cancer test of the prostate, especially for men before 60 years," has proclaimed the co - author of the study ros eeles, a professor at the institute for cancer research at the university of warwick.
The finger might help to determine what should submission men in the test of the prostate cancer, especially by combining with the risk of genetics or other factors aggrâvants family as the antécedents health care, added eeles.
During the period of 1994 - 2009 it has followed with his colleagues in the united kingdom more 1500 patients of a prostate and in the same time cancer nearly three thousand men healthy.
More than half of the participants at the study had the index of the right more short than the annulaire hand.
For them as for the 19% of those who had their fingers of the same length, it has found the same probability of an the prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer that the annulaire the risk is down to 33%, for the men 60 years before the reduction of risk has reached 87%.
The report of the two fingers cities - trained during the long period prénatale - indicates including different levels of sex hormones that is exposed the child in the womb.
Unless testostérone is an index longer.
The previous research had shown that this is precisely the testostérone that development assistance to a the prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur vacla paces, czech geneticist reappointed and former president of the academy of sciences, for ctk said that it is the course of this study but that he does not seem, seems, that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer or "completely demonstrated."

The generals believe that this new rifle automatic will influence on the conflict there with the taliban and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is as a gun super precise
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The ammunition special caliber 25 messieurs developed for this rifle and containing a functioning explosive highly breaking, in effect as small grenades.
One can time the ammunition to such a way that they will soar in contact of the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
So it is the use against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall, or a gap.
It is not more insulated from the top and when he upon a rain of homicidal shards of steel, it can combat the outlaw also.
According to richard audette that took part in the development of xm - 25, the new rifle, is the first weapon of infantry that uses technology "smart."
"The soldier in serves essentially of such a way that he found the target, he sends a" laser that determines the distance, is thus a point of specific purposes, according to which he corrects its purposes and relies on détente site.

A spokesman for fujitsu has explained that in the medium term, the group should pool 100 other jobs still scattered until here in the region.
The supply of location has been highly attractive. moreover, the offices to open area of astro park agree better the way of work collaborators.
To bad homburg also, fujitsu was just or.
The managing director, bernd wagner, said: "frankfurt - niederrad is for us a remarkable them critical with an infrastructure."
He argues that the connection to the airport precisely of great importance to a global as fujitsu.
The new relocation of a major firm within the region has aroused yesterday the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment losers.
The responsible economic business of the city of frankfurt, mr. markus frank (cdu), has said that once again, a "global player" had been so conquered.
It is a "extraordinary glib relative instead of lists."
Fujitsu is to the city and its implantation is an important momentum for niederrad.
The mayor of bad homburg, mr. michael korwisi (the greens), regretted the decision to fujitsu.
The leadership has been sooner informed the city of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we proposed our aid to the company," said mr. korwisi.
However, the cozy relations could not change the plight of the manufacturer of computers against the owner of the building to the marienbader.
Ultimately, the economic would have been critical reasons.
It is now to prevent a place if exceptional does rest inoccupé for long.
"I hope that the owner and lender construction will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the place of the of hotel, used until here by fujitsu society and the "small vertical" neighbor, as well as the rest of the place marienbad buildings, were part of the project of construction controversial thermale station.
Result of a draft of the joint council and a développeur private projects, a new entry of the city was established between the watch and the of hotel. it generated many critics, not only because of the impressive use of acreage that once in part on parked, but also because of the high buildings.
In 2001, the rating society and investment advice, feri, the manufacturer of computers for the distribution of travel, start amadeus systems, as well as fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with siemens, have moved in buildings.
In 2006, the german group of frankfurt specialist immobilien - chancen has bought buildings occupied by fujitsu housing at the same time that the fund morgan stanley. a year later, these buildings were resold to the spanish society falcon real estate investments its based in madrid.

For example, it puts computers, and servers the provision of companies and assures also the essential service.
His branch established in the region of the rhine - is one of the most important in germany: fujitsu account certainly far more employees in munich.
The branch, fujitsu technology solutions, leaves adb homburg to move to frankfurt - niederrad. the other subsidiaries present in the site are fujitsu and corporate named tds services.

Expulsion of mr. assange by amazon - threats against server
Wikileaks feel more and more difficult.
The provider of internet service amazon has expelled its servers the site specialist in the revelation of documents.
Perhaps this attitude obscures the political pressures suffered after the diplomatic publications hundreds of thousands of ratings secret.
Wikileaks founder, mr. assange, séjourne apparently in england.
The united states, the site wikileaks has dealt with ever more force.
The group of cyber - activists "wikileaks" has more access to his hosting server until here in america and is now seeking a hébergeur in europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent us senator, joe lieberman, has called on the other countries and companies to boycott wikileaks.
And the wikileaks founder julian assange, which is sought by interpol, séjourne likely in britain, according to the information released by the newspaper.
"Wikileaks excluded from the amazon server."
"Freedom of expression to freedom," said wednesday countries (hour local) cyber - activists in the origin of revelations via the social - networking twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber - company, amazon, had removed the documents wikileaks of its servers.
After the publication of ratings, cyber - activists secret diplomatic used the web of amazon service (aws) in order to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Throughout twitter, wikileaks continues his revelations: "formidable, our dollars are now spent to address people in europe."
When the freedom of expression poses a problem to amazon, "they should stop to sell books."
The tv station cnn, citing the office of mr. liebermann, reported that amazon has banned from wikileaks to use its servers after the survey carried out by the senator joe lieberman 's collaborators.
The president of the senate 's commission for the protection of territory had threatened site amazon to orchestrate a boycott in its against, has resulted in the british newspaper, "the guardian."
"I wish that amazon take this measure earlier had respect for the wikileaks previous publications information classified" said the senator.
Mr. liebermann has called the same time, other countries to reject the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegal, monstrueuse and unscrupulous, it puts our national security in danger, and the life everywhere around the world," according to a declaration of independent senators.
"No firm aware of its responsibilities, that it is foreign american or, should help wikileaks to expand the content of documents stolen."

The wikileaks spokesman, kristinn hrafnsson, has declared in london that threats have been made against the site.
"Have even been engaged appeals to the murder of julian assange."
This is why assange feared particularly to its security, has said hrafnsson.
It is also why the wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson responded clearly declarations made in north america.
In america, the republican former governor of the arkansas, mike huckabee, demanded that the leaders of the wikileaks revelations is pursued and executed for treason.
Canada, the government advisor chief of mr. stephen harper said television, evidently ironic, that mr. assange should "mr. obama might be killed" and that "use a us drone."
Meanwhile, a controversial has been underway between the white house and mr. assange.
Robert gibbs, speaker of the us, mr. president barack obama, has called "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that mr. assange has demanded the resignation of the secretary of state hillary clinton if it was responsible of order to diplomats, and divulgué just recently, to indulge in activities of espionage.
"I don 't know exactly why we need to occupy the opinion of an individual owner of a web site," says mr. gibbs.
"Our foreign policy, and the interests of this countries are far more important than the claims of a web site."
The us government is now completely to the test the protection of bases data.
According to a statement of the white house, mr. russell through, deputy director of the center of the anti - terrorist, was appointed responsible for the fight against the leaks.
Mr. through is responsible for implementing "the structural reforms necessary" made needed after the divulgations wikileaks diplomatic cables.

"We all implemented to enter into contact with them," said the speaker of the state department, philip crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if this proves necessary."
The university of the ice
To the "university gelato" of bologna, you prepares the confiseurs ice to the best seasons of the year.
The introduction of three days of organized to the intention of future glaciers has had a major success, and of attracting visitors from all the world.
In fact, where all of the ice?
The glacier and the machine to ice.
The glacier, it is - - in german the confiseur of ice somewhat yesterday, makes the fig according to all the rules of the art italian manufacturing of the ice.
The turbine to ice subtracts the fig ice of the réfrigérée to showcase the help of a spatule, has in the gaufre and then begins to sell.
For the knowledge, one does not need to go to anzola dell emilia in the province of bologna.
But anyone who want to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "gelato - university" of the italian carpigiani firm.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the university of ice in 2003, so that the crèmes of ice out of its machines responsive everywhere ideals italians high.
The introduction of three days of organized to the intention of future glaciers has had a major success, and of attracting visitors from around the world.
Are also offered prices special about the ice of chocolate and extending on several days. similarly, sessions practices are organized in private glacerie.
In the crisis quarantine, a number of people dream of a new careers, others may merely to realize their desire ardent on the ice jar.
This time, they are 40 participants from 19 countries of every continent, brazil to saudi arabia in hungary.
Jacky, a professor of education art come of california is féru slow movement food. he wants to offer the future european a product quality the country of the industrial ice.
Anke of berlin is adviser in corporate governance and it wants, after a few years, get a few thing peculiar to the job éprouvant for the nerves.
Two young egyptian dream to open a glacerie cairo.
A man from of malta and another come brazil would improve the quality of the fig cold blast in their bar, and the cleaning lady canadian came because its children love the crèmes italian freezing.
The owner glacier luciano ferraris first the participants explain the ideal features of ice perfect.
Is crucial not only the good flavor, but also the soyeuse and good consistance flexibility.
However, luciano repressed not over of training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, south: "the italian ice is simply the best: and then it retains a sacred dose of romantisme."
The first step in the manufacturing is quite simple.
Luciano pays the ingredients of basis, such as milk, the end, the poudre milk, sugar, and stabilizers in a mélangeur that chauffe of all to 85 degrees from a electronic program, then censorship immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a spigot installed on the machine: it out a fig white, basic pasteurisée, basis of all kinds of ice in milk.
The formateur is immediately embattled of question: is it possible to make of the ice in using only natural substances without stabilizing?
How can we give free in the pleasure experimentation staff?
Mr. luciano is guard against the fact is let induce in error by the spirit of time.
Whoever no that of ice "natural manufactured from the ingredients," he may be, despite all this used stabilizers: the more often a product of natural, for example, to the roller mill seed of guar raised from the bean of guar.
Of course, it is possible to make of the ice without use of stabilizing, only it sell in a delay of 24 hours, or it collapses, and the client croquera nothing more than granules of ice.
Some of the mass of changes are enabled base.
It becomes more exciting with the arômes.
The owner luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that we give in the range fruits or confiseries of supermarket.
Moreover, there is the poudre and known.
"The suppliers try all you refiler dozens of ingredients of aromatisés."
"However, you should simply try."
Is in the revenues of sorbets with fruits sugar, and the fruits costs.
Is in the crèmes manufactured freezing from the mass of white basis that, it is adding eggs becomes a fig yellow and is, when there adds of the poudre cocoa, the basis of all the desserts possible chocolate.
Now, all the participants over must move to the use of machines ice.
Luciano invites of time in time to make four kinds of ice: vanille, the chocolate, moka, and the noisette with or without eggs in the mass of basis, with more or less of natural arôme vanille or other ingredients.
The different kinds of ice in the fruits are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatiques substances, more purées fruits: the point of view of the taste, this is not absolutely best.
The ice to noisettes has not necessarily the taste cashew, when it consists in large part of noisettes.
The ice in kiwi, very popular, are made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less of stabilizing.
"Only a balanced mix is well the taste of a ice," says luciano.
The manufacture of the ice is an exercise of calculation: if we use of the purée fishing with many sugar, he than the quantity of sugar must be reduced in a recipe for basis.
An extra sugar is necessary for the ice to citron.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he defines the content of sugar of various types of fruits (the vignerons use them to measure the degree of oechsle in the moût of raisin).
Fortunately, the charts facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of the ice requires more, as once, as many of the physical intervention.
It is not only the machine automatic manufacturing to the mass of help base.
There is also a apparatus in which we is simultaneously the combination of the ice available to make onctueux and drawn to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automatisations, mild breakdowns are not excluded.
The brazilian gustavo barbouille to purée fruits of the ankles and, as well, éclabousse his pals of studies when the control of the colossal bol mélangeur him out.
The owner luciano is to believe that a "incident same may happen in every over: it is only a matter of time."
Supervisors in a position ambiguous
According to some, the industry that experimenting culture of gm plants has noyauté european authority food security.
This conclusion is now made by the group of experts testbiotech who is regarded as an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sound like a conspiracy theory, but we much information for prescribers," said mr. christoph then wednesday in munich, director of testbiotech.
Some information are state of what the president of the group of experts efsa for gm plants, mr. harry kuiper, as well as other experts efsa are under contract with the group of pressure ilsi.
The latter is financed by the groups such as monsanto, nestlé, or bayer.
Mr. kuiper has collaborated in order to prescriptions of making the test of the efsa to gm plants and is clearly, this fact, in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticism by mr. then.
The constructed fit textuellement, by prescriptions alinéas, the group 's position of pressure ilsi and so the mark of the industry that, at bottom, would be controlled by the authorities located in parme italy.
It is already the second time that testbiotech denunciation of a conflict of interest.
A responsible for top of the efsa recently joined condition or without transition period the swiss group agroalimentaire syngenta. in so doing, it has changed camp.
There is little time, even the central radio of germany (mitteldeutsche rundfunk, mdr) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the european union charged control, and the industry lobbyist, which awakened suspicions both the german federal agency for the environment that of deputies europeans.
However, the efsa recognizes the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that the one uses every reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of a good quality professional.
We banned not the experts working for the efsa to build context with this business sector.
But they should make public.
Mr. kuiper admits that he works for the international institute for international life sciences institute (the life sciences, the united states - based ilsi).
This body sees itself as a forum neutral pooling experts that belong, among others, to science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being to the supply of a hard - money lobby.
In this case, independent experts like mr. then disagree the fact that the gm plants are accepted the animals no test of food and that it has not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We are to know what, for example, the risks maize genetically modified the field" says mr. then.
The current practice is to test only the proteins isolated and not all the plant genetically modified, which does not to get reliable results.
"If you don 't seek the risks, how can we then discover?" mr. then on interviewing a tone accuser.
It is also the point of view of mrs angelika hilbeck.
This scientific do of research since 1994 in the field of genetics and working in school polytechnique zurich.
In this region as in the united states, and now also in europe, the sector of the industry tries to increasingly influence or to discredit the scientific critics.
This is why, there is barely even researchers who are not related to societies.
In the opinion of business, the studies critics would not be published.
Mrs hilbeck says that "the industry control research on security."
The record of peter
Uli gsell has procuré about, in total 400 kilograms.
Monday afternoon, it was before the watch of stuttgart with its tube in the back.
There was manif.
It neigeait.
History is known: in september, the excavatrices were coming and began to demolish a large part of the north - wing.
The world of stuttgart was no longer the same: many thousands of people protested against the project s21, the transformation of the bus terminal subterranean stuttgart central in a bus terminal that cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration led to stop the work of construction.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The muschelkalk (the calcaire coquillier) of crailsheim, a pavement reach and crude built between 1914 and 1920 poorly.
Mr. gsell is a sculptor 43 years living to ostfildern.
It is procuré some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He proclaims with enthusiasm: "a modest rock and cheap, simple and land."
It claiming that in the etched to push the the, he sensed that of the smoke cigarettes.
He did not yet know what he will make this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli gsell also.
The footsteps of stones stuttgart lead to a former deposit ammunition of the french army in a forest situated near tubingue, where manuel rongen has édifié its empire of stones.
This 44 years fact trade old man stones.
It has bought all stones from the demolition came with stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were concassées or if they disappearing in the dumping" he proclaims his office located in a brightly, which was once a guard.
He tells that he has done the subject of insults and threats when in september newspapers have reported that he had buying the rest of the north to the company - wing construction.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the project s21.
And it has explained that they could not do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it is taking place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
Around 200 opponents of the project s21 subsequently prevailed stone one of the parallélépipède burden on average 80 kilograms whose value is understood between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some, the guard as memories in while hoping also power make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 chargements comprehensive a truck.
Roughly half is still entassée in the forest, with the rest long been sold.
Owners of gardens, jardiniers paysagistes, individuals.
They are from everywhere, and has prevailed what could enter the trunk and the remorques.
These stones of scandal of stuttgart has long been transformed into "mäuerle" or limitations shelves - bands of grasses.
"In fact, this stone is nothing in particular" mr. rongen says.
"Had - been this political component."
He between in its car all stage, the turn of its vast empire 20 hectares.
He has done studies of law that he abandoned. later, he has approached studying biology of focus by the following the computer and become a carrier eventually.
And an amateur of stones.
It stocke 40000 tons.
It hoarding treasures everywhere in germany.
He argues that he is the biggest merchant stones former.
It is réfrène.
The stones of sand sculptées with art are posed on snow.
"Once, they were part of the marienbrücke in dresden bridge."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that mounting across the forest.
It shows a slew of finger: stone of sand, red previously, part of the federal watch.
And so on.
"Nice travertin."
The parallélépipède was once part of the platform of the neckarstadion stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and histories, the cannstatt from the prefecture travertin police, the granite rougeâtre from the cathedral st blasien, the tuf from the hospital heilbronn.
Which work, which efforts, what sueur!
When mr. rongen think that, once the stones were sculptées the hand and displaced to the aid of palans simple and carts pulled by horse, it becomes quite deferential.
"It would be a scandal if such a wealth was put in coin."
It is not become rich, much less richissime.
But this carrier employs today 14 people. moreover, tailleurs of stones, a sculptor, a forgeron, a souffleur glass and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is rewarding," says the recycleur of waste.
Soon, it must go in cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent to conquer the senior potential struggle
The counter experienced a keen inflows.
16 students beating a path to purchase small breads the salmon, the tomato and white - mangers mischief.
The braunschweig 's technical university and the car thing volkswagen were invited students in design and mechanical genius to a workshop.
In the framework of a kind of contest of ideas, they must speak profession about the future 's car with the originators of vw, and, in passing, knowing the volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body body in competition to find best brains and pledge, as volkswagen, in multiforme cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: recruit the graduates the more gifted as much as possible in the classes before they do on the market for employment and they are courted by others.
And, since the universities publish not statements about the performance of their students, you trying to see the talents exceptional in the context of projects and practices of the fidéliser.
In the second day of the technical organized workshop at the university of brauschweig the car group amadoue the talents.
A young woman the service of the stylos, sharing of treat personnel and with the logo of cards volkswagen.
It speaks timing of stages professionals and jobs students to the young skills; it shows the paths to gain access to the group 's boardroom.
It is nico board of the university of braunschweig technique who is responsible for the project committed with volkswagen.
For him, it is of mutual benefit for the two parties: "the students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"About the volkswagen group, it can know students, look more closely the serious candidates and enjoy those who enter in line of account as a collaborator."
According to mr. board, such cooperation is unusual.
What there are new, it is the offensive with which it seeks to attract the students.
"Once, the emphasis was on the project professional rather," says mr. board.
The struggle for conquest of new graduates will become much more stark.
In goods sectors, firms can no longer recruiting their collaborators to make a tri on a string of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and especially woo highly skilled labor.
It is the most from whom are pursuing engineering graduates who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of engineers germans vdi, more than 40,000 positions of engineers remained inoccupés in october.
And, according to the forecasts of the vdi, to the vacuum relative to engineer posts while will expand still.
Novel dykta will to the manhunt for talent for kpmg, cabinet of audit, expertise, accounting and council.
It organizes of costly events aimed at the recruitment of talent, like the rally cruise kpmg - race, a species race - paper where competitors must find their way to the aid of coordinated tankers.
The firm 's next year will send eight students promising much as so that they roam in this way the united states.
The participants can seen visit subsidiaries of kpmg and know the firm.
That must be there be decided to advance after two procedures of selection.
Only the end of the end of many candidates will soar to the united states.
According to mr. dykta, the means used to the quest for high potential in the universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge occurrence thanks to the race cruise."
"For we, a simple cruise was too little of thing"
For the chasseur mr. dykta of talent that is, the account appears to be there.
"Until now, we remained in contact with all people took part last year to a similar action."
"Some of them are about to end their studies and want to send their demands soon to our firm." he says.
Outside the direct amadouement made in the campus, small and medium - sized businesses just to proceed is classic business by participating in the fairs where they are engaged in the manhunt brains.
"We try to reach the graduates participating in the cozy professionals."
"For example, the living room solar technologies," indicates mrs sitha stübe, director of human resources in solarworld, manufacturer of panels solar.
This firm set in bonn employs about 1500 people in germany.
Mrs stübe has knowledge of the linked to the is problematic.
Currently, 35 positions are contest on the site of the company.
"In this moment, it is very difficult to positions vacancies."
"This expensive and takes a lot of time," assures?
Another way to establish the contact is to pass through the university professors.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with different institutions of higher education, for example, the university of fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the possibility of the stages professional or write her project end to study in us."
For the advertising campaigns expensive are announced in scholars of solar.
This is why the enterprise trying to do its advertising in highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and communications easy.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," supports mrs stübe, chief of staff.
Long ago, the money is more the main role in the pursuit of employment.
Working hours flexible, the guard children or good opportunities to promote are other factors roles.
According to a study by the institute great place to work, solarworld assumes the 55e place among the best employers 100 of germany.
The annual honor institute is a picture of german employers.
To this effect, it the collaborators interviewing on their degree of satisfaction relative to their work and its while watching the conditions context - executives of employees.
The chief of staff mrs stübe hopes that this institutionalization will enhance the company 's image among applicants.
"I think that the candidates in recovering especially in regard to external assessments an employer potential," says she says.
Wolf reiner kriegler academy of german deba (deutscher use branding akademie, deba) advises the companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by levying a long - term strategy.
He advises to customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to mr. kriegler internal, this means, above all take steps.
"The best way for an employer to get attractive is to pass through its own collaborators," he says.
This is called, after the jargon used in the sector, the strategy of internal image, it is - - the creation of the image of marks the employer within his own effective.
"The collaborators satisfied form the best messengers."
When it is treating well its employees and they identify with the company, they are doing all only advertising their employer from their friends and knowledge.
"It is as if you played in a orchestra," says mr. kriegler.

There will be no new oil drilling in the gulf of mexico 's coast of florida, state - is of southern united states, over the years to come.
Washington 's government has delivered a ban a ban equivalent and, as well, permanently initial scrapped plans.
Even the atlantic to the coast, new drilling remain for the moment forbidden.
The secretary of the interior ken salazar has the announcement wednesday.
It is the explosion, in april, the platform of drilling "deepwater horizon," which is at the root of this ban strict. it must remain in force at least for the next five years.
Face of this crash that cost life to 11 employees and led to the greater environmental catastrophe of the united states, president barack obama, under pressure from the opposition and of the business sector, had indicated that he was willing to allow the achievement of new drilling in the eastern part of the gulf of mexico.
Advocates of this solution want and reduce dependence of the united states vis - à - vis foreign countries for what is to oil supplies.
The question of who wears the responsibility of the bp oil spill devastating in the gulf is not, until now, permanently resolved.
The group british oil, which faces compensation claims of several billion, lies at the center of charges.
A commission of inquiry created by obama must presenting its current conclusions december.
In october, the secretary of the interior ken salazar had lifted the freeze of drilling argued after the collapse of the platform.
Following this decision, different groups had immediately presented requests concerning of new oil drilling projects.
With measures stricter controls and tougher offered security, obama and salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The authority of control, who has discredited after many charges of corruption, currently the object of reformes in depth.
Similarly, mr. obama announced the remove the profitable niches fiscal groups gas and oil.
The actors in this sector of activity warn now publicly against the fact that the flow of food in the gulf would be far weaker than it is the case so far.
"The government 's goal is to halt to rapid growth in the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current poll in the sector - by the cabinet of audit bdo, before the prohibition of drilling pronounced wednesday.
Indeed, the american enery alliance laments the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "nobody knows what exactly change with regulation."
New projects support investment agreed in postponed until new order, at the expense of growth.
The country ogoni is to sec
The running water in the rivers is functioning brown push; it exudes an similar to that exist in the station of gasoline: as a result of a flight, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country ogoni in nigeria.
The men live of theft, corruption and oil raffinage.
Celestine akpobari has a good intention.
"Don 't épuisez," launching the activist environmental to journalists to calm: "you even today enough mud oil to the water lentille."
The nigerian of 37 years has tried to photographed a young over water boueuse until the breasts, as well as the drag grasse that surrounds: this stage seems almost beautiful in some water to the color of rainbow zone.
One cannot find that the under - ground of imagining groundwater brunes of crude oil.
On the side of the river bodo - jetty, esther badom tells that, once, it received entire shrimp by buckets here.
But meanwhile the waters calm have completely exhausted.
Five years ago, an enormous quantity of oil must have sprung a pipeline with exploded in the immense swamp.
Fishermen capita neighboring the small town of bodo must now ramer for six hours to reach the waters poissonneuses: the country ogoni located at the heart of the niger delta is considered one of the most polluted areas of the world.
Any the extent of ravages in barnavi when one for the marsh of mangrove experienced by during waters.
Instead of a clear water, the motor fend a ship water brown cradingue. anyone plunge his hand the out any recouverte of oil.
The roots of small of the soil mangrove emerge as sticks of réglisse. the palmiers isolated be sadly hang their palmes.
We sought in vain the nuées of birds, as we in meeting wet typically in the areas: advance the engine out - edge stops, a silence fantomatique is rushing on this past paradise that looks like a station - service by the push that they produce.
"What is happening here, it is war against the environment," says mr. celestine akpobari of a air sad: "life is characterized by a permanent danger regarding health."
The comparison wars is made.
The region where the ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for dozens of years: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers europeans have entered here; the first was organized resistance in the 1980 's by ken saro - wiwa. it was executed later. in 1993, the group shell had to stop its production activities in this region because it had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to countries ogoni is forbidden this society: as more than 2 million barrel of gold black are daily pompés thanks to more than 5,000 wells drilling deals and 7,000 kilometers of oil in the whole of the delta region, three times greater like switzerland, the country 's oil fields ogoni are untapped, because the situation is too unstable to this group oil.
All the few hundred meters stand in the water tréteaux in steel such as bizarre sculptures: one for very affectueusement "trees of christmas" the warheads of holes drilling deals.
They have until 50 years, most are rongées by the corrodes until the benchmark.
Akpobari believe that the head of drilling of this nature is puzzles of time to time in piece, because a reliable stream of crude oil runs in water.
According to estimates of experts, more than two billion gallons have flowed on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the passed in the sea during the crash of super - oil "exxon valdez" 21 years ago off the alaska, one of the largest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who is responsible persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actor.
For the group shell, sabotage and the siphonage of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 pourcent of pollution, environmentalists for their part regard the explosions of warheads drilling, and the oil perforés as the main causes.
In 2008, the us researcher richard steiner reproached the group shell to apply to nigeria of safety standards essentially less robust than elsewhere in the world: only the rate of failures conducted is "much higher than alleures."
Some emerging forms of wetlands to a place that, given from afar, looks like a workshop abandoned, full of cambouis and installed in the air free: they are fully tops and covered cambouis until the necks.
A fire scintille under one of many tonneaux who been links to the pipes, been scattered without charge on the site must be répérés: a small refinery underground.
You heat crude oil in the minded for several hours, explains michael, the chief of team.
In a prime time, the gasoline enters a récipient by pipes, then, the end of the conduct of gouttes kérosène fall and the one gets finally of diesel.
It is as well as michael and its four collaborators produce daily four fûts of diesel 300 gallons: "we reports 34 naira," about $22.
The delta people reap party of chronic shortages of fuel in the largest oil producer of countries in sub - saharan africa.
Nigeria has only to one refineries.
The raffineurs illegal can sell at a cheaper than absurdly low price of euro at barely 40 cents per liter of diesel: because they acquire free their commodity.
It is offered by the "safe" that puts the network of oil in perce everywhere throughout the country of ogoni. according to the experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil throughout the niger delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant of the raw materials temporarily stored is illegally purifiée: networks of organized crime that also matter among its members top politicians and military, do the lion 's share in tankers, and the dump on the global market.
The activist akpobari views the debate about the question of whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or, rather subversives activities to the population lax or the way of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as the prowler and if the foundation of the lives of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be sabotage, or illegal robbery and refineries."
But, meanwhile, relations ogoni especially vis - à - vis shell is are so détériorés that it was more question that the withdrawal of the group. "perhaps the operators with other nationalities, as the chinese, are best prove."
Then, michael becomes nervous.
"It is time that you déguerpissiez" heralds the robust worker oil.
"The troops may appear at any moment."
If the raffineurs illegal are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will, of course, not the object of arrest, but all the more they offer of bribes.
Even the soldiers especially from north countries mean benefit as all nigerians to the raw materials.
"To all point of view, this ruined fix has brought down our country well low," regretted akpori.
The discover investigators flaws of construction in the reactors of the a380
The a380 suffers clearly of a major security problem.
Examining a apparatus that made an emergency landing, researchers found a possible default construction that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline qantas is now sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early november, the passengers of airbus belonging to the quantas company had clearly been so far more likely: in the survey that it has conducted australia, the authority of the airplane safety has found that the reactors in some equipment a380 showed a serious problem of security, and it is building in guard against a possible default.
This failure potential could cause serious consequences: it can cause of criques fatigue, and leaks in the level of raccordement of the conduct of oil, says it in a stance published this jeudi by the administration of the atsb.
It could lead to a "default catastrophic reactors."
Are concerned the reactors made rolls - royce and refitting 20 aéronefs of the string a380.
The airbus of the quantas company, which had to land emergency on november 4 in singapore, is among those around.
The airline australia has now committed legal proceedings against the manufacturer english reactors.
It brought a complaint justice with a federal court australian whose is headquarters in sydney. this approach gives the possibility of take other legal measures against the society.
The head of quantas, mr. alan joyce, said that his company réclamerait damage - interests relative to the incident occurred in early november.
Of spare parts are via and the surface broadly has been damaged during the fire driver.
According to rolls - royce, it is the inflammation oil that is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors should now be replaced in the world.
The australian investigators announced that other tests relative to the security will be made on the superjumbos who are also equipped reactors in issues.
The recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with rolls - royce, has said the speaker of the astb, mr. martin dolan.
The problem of security is regarded as sufficiently important to inform all parties involved.
After the emergency landing of its airplane, airline quantas had incapacitated the ground his entire fleet of a380 during a week.
Singapore airlines has temporarily incapacitated three of its 11 a380.
The company much business has replaced, by measure of precautionary, the reactor of an a380.

Go to hell, warrior!
The film splatter is a movie artificial?
The filmmaker nicolas winding refn explore the limits of the kind former thanks to his film, "valhalla over there rising," of epic fighter.
How nicolas winding danish public the filmmaker refn he well have thought by turning "valhalla over there rising"?
A warrior viking (mads mikkelsen) only with an eye is prisoner; he relents is its executioner and, with a almost supernatural force, eliminates its opponents after the other. this seems to be ideal to young male spectacle to the search for a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses methods of sharp assassination. when it is bad mood, it hard the gut of its enemies without expecting that these are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borgne said no word on its true name. even the other figures let escape, at most, in détour of one or two phrases some cries of agony unspeakable.
Otherwise, it is said nothing and one festoie in the mountain extraordinarily beautiful landscape of scotland that is the stage of the universe of vikings, about 1,000 years ago.
This would be ideal more the filmmakers mature having a interest for the existentialisme and the travellings excellent.
When a movie is several groups - targets, it is pity that those will mutually exclusive.
The filmmaker winding refn is seen, since authored a "pusher," its unholy on trafiquant of drug fierce and full of style, as a kind of quentin tarantinon danish, but he is refuses to provide a little more than mood at mainstream or introduce a little less of brutality movies art and test.
Most supporters of the movie art must be the horror against the brain that spreads around and the gut.
The amateurish films action die boredom, when the borgne embarque, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of violent christian missionaries in a vessel to destination of jerusalem; they are drowning for forever by the calm and the haze before the équipage comes in america and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising that "valhalla over there rising" has found no distributor films in germany, and that there are only under the dvds format.
This is especially to cause of images magnificent poverty that has deserves some attention, but also because the image of a movie exciting, time to time, hides behind a prétentieuse appearance and bloody.
It is not dialogue in the film, neither a coherent, all action is atmosphere in feverish, a dream transformed film.
The initiatives cannot escape.
Refn considers it barely a moment of and cup slowly détente with images glaciales gorge and a gang sonore the dismal, but especially with a elusive hatred that jaillit from the heart of figures.
Only a boy blond, which is poised faithfully alongside the borgne, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than all, the hero borgne whose mobile are never known, but that is of the hell at any moment to fight for enemies and temporarily allies in transforming itself warrior, may be in envoy of the devil itself.
He is the decay, but also may be, only to those who are, of all way, rotten.
"Valhalla over there rising" is a film enigmatic that you can détester or admired, which has to end the irritation, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Of terrassement mysterious work
The international atomic energy agency (iaea) has of new indications about a nuclear program developed by syria.
But it refuses to take a position on this subject, much less subservience to the agency 's controls.
In the night of 5 - 6 september 2007 to midnight, at least four fighter planes to f - 15 i israelis have attacked a mysterious construction form of cubique over the syrian territory.
It lies on the side of the euphrates; the largest city located in proximity happens to 30 kilometers: it is dair as - on.
His name is in the documents the iaea, because it is question of the reactor that syria has built it is with the help of north korea in stone parallélépipède, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of current electricity.
According to a briefing of intelligence services in the united states, the cia, dating end of april 2008, the current reactor, known as the name of the local neighbor, al - kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would make the nuclear weapons.
By contrast, this technical applies since the 1950 's.
The cia has shown a video of presentation of images satellites blurred.
Throughout the animation assisted by computer, it said the them of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the central who represents a copy in miniature 's nuclear north korea' s model of the central yongbyon.
In addition, it has presented the photos showing the construction located nearby, even the within it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be applied in service, but it was not yet equipped for fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after israel 's bombing, one has barely more information that at the same time, and even, with the mystery épaissit increasingly.
The former us president george w. bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, of course, the cia was confident that syria built a reactor to al - kibar, but it had little evidence showing that country "developed a active of nuclear weapons program."
Some of intelligence agents in europe prefer to be more cautious about this and talk only a "suspected" reactor, even if they regard the presentation of the cia as "plausible."
They lack of evidence, as well as to the iaea.
Asked about how it ensures that he dealing with a nuclear reactor, a united nations diplomat high - ranking has given that a laconique response in summer in arguing that the iaea had enough "documents to question."
The syrians certainly have seized with hasten the rubble of military "construction inutilisé" and process to a aplanissement orderly on the ground.
In june 2008, however, a team of the iaea conducted by the former chief inspector oli heinonen, has discovered to al - kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
Moreover, the iaea has received thanks to a member state images of satellites of the trade providers showing the time that followed directly the attack. it appears that the latter are more dramatic those presented by the cia.
However, the photos are not available on the market because the been anonymous israel, perhaps, have acquired in exclusivity.
It is therefore impossible for the iaea establish their authenticity of way objective.
Syria has always ensured that it had never made a secret atomic program and that it did not built reactor.
Damascus argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by israel.
But the iaea has récusé this argument after the analysis of particles in the as improbable.
Since that time, damascus refuses all discussion about this, as images of satellite over.
In addition, syria is not to supervisors to make a second inspection on the site of al - kibar and refusal access to rubble of building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even israel retains a silence stubborn.
Confirming the official position, then prime minister ehud olmert, exercise at the time of the attack, recently said: "we will never comments about this."
It is as well as the investigation in this case dragged on since june 2008 without one reach a result, and that it "increasingly turn of a serious problem credibility of the agency," as the top recognizes a western diplomat in the siege of the iaea in vienna service, finally it comes to a serious violation of the ban treaty of nuclear weapons.
The iaea regards to make progress, it must cleared the existence of three other facilities that must have "a report functional" with the suspected reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated of which it is here facilities, and what is their function or what they are suspect to contain.
According to information released by the journal "süddeutsche zeitung," they are known within the iaea, respectively under the names of marj as - sultan, masyaf and neighboring iskandariayah also in the name of cities.
The institute independent international institute for science and international security (institute of science and international security) of washington has identified these localities and discovered about images of satellites a complex near masyaf that would be very probably one objects suspect.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly to side of it; it is precisely why syria refuses access to three sites the iaea inspectors.
In vienna, it argues that the syrians fear that the group of inspection is in fact spies who would be sent in the name of us by the iaea to spy on military installations.
True, it is a secret provided by the intelligence agents americans that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The iaea has information, including the photos satellites, indicating that vehicles have made a stone shuttles between the three sites and the parallélépipède to transport substances.
A top western diplomat in vienna said that, at least one of might "serve to fuel" production facilities.
It would "no indications activities sensitive" concerning, such as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of nuclear weapons.
Certainly, such reactor works thanks to enriched uranium not.
Nevertheless, there is to the humiliation of plausible assumptions about the following questions fundamental: where would have to come uranium and where would - be separated later the plutonium needed to make the bomb.
One ignores if the gravats, who could hide traces of great value, have been stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of trucks responsible for land have disappeared, no one would command of information about the instead of storage gravats.
For the iaea, it, is unlikely that syria made examine in 1998, the salt of al - tibni, located only a few kilometers of al - kibar, on the other side of euphrates rivers, to see if he can agree storage of waste radioactive.
In analyzing recently satellite photos taken to the account the famous jane magazine 's intelligence review, former of the iaea inspector, mr. robert kelley has established a link between it and the reactor in question.
But satellite photos taken show that syria has undertaken in the work of terrassement in the three suspected sites and displaced huge container when the iaea started to demand access to these places.
It is possible that a coincidence, but this has not contributed to dismiss the suspicion.
In the diplomatic in it is said that the iaea has spent several months to devise a plan concerning the inspections to perform. this plan should allow syria to preserve of possible military secrets. only time invested shows how great interest the inspectors are to this matter.
Meanwhile, damascus has also thwarts this proposal.
A year ago, if western diplomats in vienna has not done state of the destruction of the reactor, and emergency would not be reported for this incident, argues, for example, glyn davies, the us ambassador who recalls in recent months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful tools whose agency has to implement its atomic controls.
The head of the iaea, mr. yukiya amano, that had to offer such inspections, has already spoke of "an option that i am open to the future," but it still hesitates.
This means has a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the iaea 's governing council and a lot of 35 countries that are represented have no desire to see the situation know escalating.
On the other hand, as they diplomat that gives to réflechir: "it would serve, if at the end they find nothing"
Love in times of war
It is wrong since that angelina jolie has made its beginnings in summer as fulfilling.
It wrote the scenario itself: it is a history of love between a woman fan in bosnia and a man of origin serbian.
We know nothing more about this history, but it is enough to produce malaise.
A persistent rumors indicates that the woman, a muslim, has fallen love of serbian its executioner during the war of yugoslavia.
The federations women bosnian have immediately protested. in response, some of tournage scheduled sequences at sarajevo have been displaced last minute in hungary.
Meanwhile, the film turned in hungary, but in the post - production phase, protests continue always in bosnia.
According to the information published in a journal bosnian, bakira hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a corresponds to angelina jolie by the un high commission for refugees (hcr), and it has required to meet the actress. jolie itself ambassador of goodwill of hcr.
It is not diplomat. a few weeks ago, it has proposed to these women of keeping a meeting with them in hungary, but subsequently have declined this supply.
"The meeting should be held in bosnia," says hasecic.
There has been no stories of love in the concentration camps, and the pattern of jolie tells enough on its attitude towards the victims.
The guardian reports that the organization of hasecic has, in turn, recommended in un high commission to withdraw the quality of ambassador of willingness to angelina jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario jolie has it wrote?
The ministry bosnian culture, which has received copies of his scenario, gave after hesitating license to tournage in sarajevo, but we do not know why is not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assures itself that it pursues not political objectives with his film, that it is so many efforts that it is yugoslav informed of the conflict. it argues that it wants to establish the horrible consequences of war and give the possibility to make all parties to speak.
It is nonetheless wave over the content.
It is thus that a second synopsis of the film circulating on the net. it is quite different: the were aware loving well before the beginning of the war. he meet again when the woman, a muslim bosnian serb, is déportée in the concentration camp where the man works as guardian.
What is all of even a large difference with the "a victim of rape amourache version of its executioner."
That 's film jolie has begun well before the war, of course.
The pressure pressure on it, as well speaks jolie, is "unfair and based on information erronnées."
Now, only the fanatics hollywood can him obtain peace: in illegally this scenario in the net, as many other before.
Tirons we!
This evening, all will again well among the irish.

And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years seeks to amuse, away from the question térébrante, which would lead on the future.
The pleasure of play las vegas is not in its projects. in january, he will preside interviews of employment in new zealand.
But "i feel a strange sentiment" he says.

What is a huge loss on a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts is made, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that which ireland has suffered in the 1980 's.
After a decade of economic boom in which the irish have enjoys a great ease, the pain is now place.
The economic crisis engulfs but especially young irish, well trained, which have so far that moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the boom years.
All the world had a job, there is to the money in excesses.
But, meanwhile, three in ten people of less than three years are in unemployment.
The newspaper irish times publish widely letters readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "in ireland, everything goes to drift."

The routine democratic
Support for democracy in latin america continues to increase, like that in the private company.
The crime has become a greatest concern that unemployment.
And brazil is seen as more influential than the us into a large part of the region.
There are some of the outcome of the latest survey latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published in exclusive by the economist.
Given that has been poll the steady since 1995, he follows the changes in behavior in the region.
Two elements linked out of the outcome of of this year, poll in september and in early october.
The first is the mood enough ensoleillée of latin america.
The second is the growing stability of the major attitudes towards democracy and its institutions.
Support for democracy has increased markedly in several countries on the pourtour of peaceful of south america (see picture 1).
For example in peru, where economic growth has reached 6% per year on average since 2002, support for democracy has gone from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also has increased in mexico, where the economy has revived having suffered a sharp fall in output last year.
But only about half of the répondants mexico and brazil, the two largest countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see picture 2).
Some 44% of répondants of the region are satisfied with the way stated their country 's democracy worked in practice; it is the same figure that last year but with a sharp rise in the 25% in 2001 (figure 3)
Some 34% have said that they had confidence in their country 's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as the last year in both cases, but the sharp rise relative to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in latin america have undermined the support to democracy.
If it has held for the global financial crisis, it is certainly the fact that many of america countries have suffered a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
Moreover, a network of social security has contributed to protect the poor.
(The united nations economic commission for latin america has resulted in this week that the proportion of latin american living in poverty increased that slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32%).
But the mood varies substantially from country to another (see. figure 4).
Brazil 's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president luiz inácio lula da silva, reflected in a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in mexico and central america, where the recession has been more severe and where the violent crimes have worsened.
This is that, for the second time since the poll began that more than répondants across latin america as a whole cited the crime rather than unemployment as the biggest problem for their countries (see picture 5).
Roughly 31% say that themselves or a of their close have been victim of an act criminal over the last year, nonetheless, this figure is in decline relative to the 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise to support the firm private and the market economy: about 71% of the region 's répondants say that the private company is indispensable for development, against 56% in 2007 (see. figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed countries, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of répondants venezuela are the judgment (and 80% support the company private), even if their left - wing president, hugo chávez, exproprie many private enterprises.
Brazil is the greatest leadership in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (versus 18% last year), followed by the united states (9%, unchanged relative to the last year) and venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the united states are seen as the most influential country by the répondants mexico and in much of central america, while venezuela basks in this distinction in ecuador, the dominican republic and nicaragua.
A vote muddied
No one expected to have perfect general election in haiti november 28.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the country affected and plunged into the fear.
It was presented strips of elections and a new election, of the ballot box dispersed in the goutières, of polling stations suffered and intimidation
The polling opening later the night.
Many hatïens, including many who have been displaced following the earthquake in january, erraient in the vicinity to find where vote.
Some of them have come to abandon.
A dozen of the presidential candidates, including alleged several front, denounced fraud, and have asked the repeal of the election.
The protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, edmond mulet, the official in haiti of the un, regards the event as "an election enough good in many ways."
Observers from the organization of american states and the community of caribbean have carefully stated that they do not "believed that these irregularities, as serious are, had necessarily nullified the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are beholden to rené préval, outgoing president unpopular, and to his candidate, jude célestin, must announce the results preliminary the december 7.
The second round expected is scheduled for january.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, michel martelly, a musicians of rap, and mirlande manigat, a former first lady, have walked out of their initial call for that the vote is said no.
But there can be if problems mr. célestin, who has little or no support evident among voters, is said by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million of survivors earthquake that still live in tents, we feared that the participation would be.
In the occurence, many haitïens wanted to vote but have been unable to do so, owing to the désorganisation.
Nearly 250,000 cards of identity, needed to vote, were not distributed shortly before the election.
The challenge is important.
Donors see the election of a popular, and legitimate government as a milestone in the reconstruction of haiti.
And so, it is clear, haitians the are themselves.
The forefront of feet to the center
The weeks after have become suddenly widow, cristina fernández, president of argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy of the public that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, to more than 50%; it comes to its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet, transform this in a successful campaign to a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of mrs fernández, clearly into mourning, according to which it abandon or not the intransigence of his predecessor late husband, and former political partner, néstor kirchner.
And, here, the signs remain confused.
Mr. kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife replaced as president, used to develop budgets, under - believed tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend the extra money at will.
The government of mrs fernández has lost its majority in congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was thrown into the distress following the death of mr. kirchner of a heart attack the 27 october.
Some of the dissident members of the peronist movement of power has rallied around mrs fernández.
But after sessions chaotic (where a parliamentary hit in the face one of his peers and others have accused the of corruption), congress government did not to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not arguing," said the president.
Currently, the budget 2010 will be enforced next year, leaving the president even greater room to maneuver to spend at will.
The economy overheating largely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation stands now 11,1% but many estimates income private and the claims of unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. kirchner, who took office in 2003 when argentina had feared a collapse, has a priority of economic growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
It has refused to deal with the imf, he has harassed the private sector and purged the indec, the statistical office, who has process of falsifications of official statistics on inflation.
Mrs fernández can far moderate these policies?
It has called for talks between private businesses and union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by global prices high agricultural exports in argentina.
But inflation has eroded the nudge to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps the reason why mrs fernández shows signs of wanting to reestablish relations financial argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has struck a deal with the bondholders had refused an earlier restructuring forced to debt why argentina did not addressed its maturities in 2001.
Now ms fernández seems to be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the paris club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could involve a surveillance by the imf, as it is to custom.
But the last month, amado boudou, the minister of the economy, has announced that the fund provide a "technical assistance" to create a new national consumer price index; what looks like a prelude of cleaning up of the indec.
It is not clear if mrs fernández wants remain in politics beyond the end of his term, now that her husband is more to its side.
If it does, it needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When the argentine will returned of their summer vacations in march, the wave of sympathy for it reflué.
If it wants to be another election, it will have to decide to repudiate or not, of her husband without noise, many policies.
A half - hurra for china
The voters taiwanese are oriented closer a kind of a union with the continent.
What is it that taiwan thinks of its older brother located of the other side of the strait?
More of 7.5 million voters have presented the 27 november, or 70% of people admissibles, to elect urban, mayors city and advisers in five districts in the framework of which is regarded as a general assessment of the president, ma ying - jeou.
Mr. my is itself become a substitute for the feelings relative to the continent, having reached business ties partial innovators, including a pact free trade, in the largest remodeling of relations with china per se since 1949.
Mr. my managed the test, but just.
Although his party kuomintang (kmt) has won three of five mairies, it has failed to win the majority of the vote.
Instead, the democratic - progressive party (dpp), which has turned to the independence of taiwan, won close to 50% of all the vote for the kmt 45%.
If this was a presidential race, mr. my would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of vote of his party has declined by roughly 8%.
For the first time, the dpp has attracted of voters, even with the kmt in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most subjects major elections taiwan, including of trucks to aggressive campaign and mass flags of assembly with minimal girls who dancing in held.
An assassination attempt mysterious obligatory has also been committed.
Sean link, the son of link chan, president honorary electoral kmt, have made a tour to a candidate kmt on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd has learned over the young mr. link, purely through the face, the blessant and killing a passing.
Strangely, it has not been determined if the shooter wanted to do evil mr. link or a dispute with resolve the candidate.
In any case, says tsai ing - wen, the pdp 's leader, the murder had an impact on the election in leader the suspicion of the dpp and by turning voters towards the kmt.
Perhaps the biggest winner in china was election.
It was striking to see how the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have jouté with public plans to the housing and job creation.
Taiwan has usually of independence is and military loathes the threat of china.
Thus, the kmt tends to avoid parader its ties with the government in beijing.
But this time, the dpp has also refrained to stir up the anti - chinese.
This is the answer to a new awareness that the chinese enterprises are essential to taiwan 's economic survival.
Mr. my, for its part, has claimed confirmation to whether its policy relative to china was acceptable to the majority taiwan.
We can expect to what the government in beijing continues to provide of commercial easing, according to its strategy that aims at blind taiwan, return to the cold.
China has wasted little time to send a negotiator taipei to convene a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
True, it would also see a political integration; but start by the beginning.
Better wait to this after the 2012 presidential election.
The dpp has anyway reinventing itself.
Two years ago, he was collapsing: his former chief, chen shui - bian, was sent in prison following charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, it was a provocative in favor of an implicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates saw the day under the leadership of mrs tsai and the pdp any in to attract the professionals and the young.
Mrs tsai was being hailed as a dpp candidate for the presidency, like su tseng - mr. chang, which has served under chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he, too, can engage with beijing.
Mrs tsai announced schemes to a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the dpp and china, provided that their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Mrs tsai tells to the public taiwanese that his party presents an alternative "trustworthy" relative to the approach precipitated of mr. my about china.
Mr. chen seems infuriated by this change.
In a statement published in his cell, he declared that the pdp 's candidates have got better if they had insisted that taiwan is a distinct countries.
He even ordered to mr. su, a pragmatic, not to run the presidency.
Even without the intervention of mr. chen, the dpp of evil have to choose between its potential candidates.
Let the kmt makes a reflection of itself.
Assessments of mr. my have been low; despite phenomenal economic growth, the candidates kmt did not wanted campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to the unemployment and in the enlargement of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman kmt said that his cabinet as well as its local towers will be remaniées.
The performance of the pdp suggest that taiwan 's support for the rapprochement is limited.
In the same time, most taiwanese see the economic integration with china as inevitable.
According to antonio chiang, a eminent columnist, "the point of no return is already spent."
Appointments to grammy awards: the pop of jazz esperanza spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Trip to the demand for a president, and people are held to take knowledge.
Esperanza spalding, the bassiste jazz and pop to 26 years cueillies by president obama to occur during his nobel peace ceremony in 2009, marked the one of the grammy surprises awards this year, with a large - scale appointment of in the category of "best new artist."
Given that spalding is a very known on the scene from the jazz since its record of 2008, "esperanza," the appointment a little mysterious remains, but it is compatible with the rules of grammy awards according to which an artist should not pull more than three albums before the registration; what "establishes the public identity of the artist."
His ambitious record of 2010, "chamber music society," has certainly marked a step forward and, given its style vocal slightly engaging, skilled of pop and funk and its latin influences, it is possible to craft at least a line pointillée to spalding relative to soaring success of norah jones in 2003, the grammy 's equivalent closest to voters awards considering the products of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters of the grammy awards have rightly honored "historicity" of vijay iyer threesome in the category "record instrumental," a virée on a frisson revigorant of a registration who was one of the favorites crucial last year.
Among these iyer, "moody 4b" of the saxophoniste veteran james moody and "positootly" of claviériste john beasley will be particularly in competition.
Trombone shorty, favorite to voice rauque of new orleans and invited common to "treme" hbo, has been honored in the category of contemporary jazz; that is not victorious by elsewhere heavily to a certain fusion with the albums stanley clarke, john mclaughlin and jeff lorber.
Savage secret society of darcy james argue, more comfortable with the steampunk, won a few recognition well - deserved in the category great whole; in competition with the rich chamber - jazz of billy childs whole and an eternal aventurier dave holland whose record "pathways" of its octet 's democratic live was a good example of the hand of this bassiste as head of group.

A microbe tolerant the arsenic raises the possibility of new types of lives on earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use the arsenic as one of its elements nutrient, widens the scope to find new forms of life on earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers found the bacteria unusual here on earth, they argue that this shows that life has beyond opportunities of major elements that have been seen as essential.
"This body has a double ability."
"It can be developed either with phosphore, or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very particular, even if it is far from being a form of life really" foreign, "has commented paul davies c. w. of the university of state of arizona, co - author of the report identified in the online edition of jeudi the journal science.
Six major elements have long been regarded as essential for life: the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, the oxygen, the phosphore and the soufre.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovery in the single, "mono lake in california, is able to continue to develop after replaced the phosphore by the arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said ariel anbar of. the university of state of arizona, co - author of the report.
The discovery is important for research of life beyond the land because researchers must be able to recognize the life, to know what life looks, says anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, that did not divulgué the details of the trouvaille, the internet has generated speculation peddled on which the report might disclosing the discovery of life extraterrestre.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, regulators could be able to use other elements to actionner the standard biochemistry and that the whole" "elements that we judge absolutely necessary for life, could not be set," has commented charles cockell, a professor at the global scientific research institute and open university, milton spacial, keynes, the uk.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new, because it shows the substitution of an element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemically structure," has added cockell.
It was not a accidental discovery.
Felisa wolfe - simon of the institute of astrology from nasa, who led the study, chose the single because it is "mono lake with high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and the phosphore are chemically similar; so it has spéculé that a microbe exposed to two substances could be able to substitute one to another.
"The toxic arsenic is mainly because its behavior is really akin to that of phosphore chemical."
"As a result, regulators have of evil to distinguish between these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough to that he does not exactly as the phosphore; it forced to the interior and, in some kind, chewing the work of our biochemically," has explained anbar machine.
Researchers have garnered the bacteria known as the name of gfaj - 1 and have exposed to growing concentrations of arsenic which it has been able to adapt and grow.
The microbe growing better with the phosphore but the fact that he can live with the arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using the arsenic can occur naturally, or elsewhere on earth or another planet or the moon where arsenic is more pronounced.
Jamie. foster dulles, a professor of microbiology deputy at the university of florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphore, was not new; but nothing has never shown that this could work.
The arsenic was more pronounced at the beginning of the existence of the earth, said it; so researchers have issued the assumption that the first forms of life could have use.
This suggests that there could be other ways form of life, not only how life on earth was formed at the start, "said foster dulles, which was not part of the research team of wolfe - simon.
Research has been financed by nasa, the ministry of energy and the national institute of health.

One side provide more soft order in china
Tang shenbin arpentait a position of the city like a sergeant urban at the training in inspectant severely its nerve, by issuing burdens lower tones orders with a military rule.
He wanted the members of chengguan female - large of the public order in china, feared and scorned for their arbitrary repression, and their penchant for violence - transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Wait - you right!"
"Keep perçantes!"
Infringing - their, he says, "what look pretty girls!"
Four girls who had barely past the teens in gloves off white, popularly of jackets and pantalons identical color olive, figeaient to the guard - - you.
Four members of shoes black achilles, lined up to the rule.
Four chapeaux treated perfectly perchés the summit hair committed by a noeud rayé in blue and white.
"Personally, i believe that they have a appearance average," said mr. tang, with disdain.
"The models are beautiful."
More than a government has tried to cool the image of china 's urban inspectors.
A city has required that all new recruits have a degree of study higher.
Guangdong province traded the greys - green uniforms against a blue supposedly more binding.
Central wuhan, china, has replaced the lower - - eyes by how strong:: in 2009, a report warned that 50 officers had surrounded a trolley to snack uncontrollable by launching scrutiny blacks, firmly for a half - hour, until the colporteur packing up its business and parte.
Xindu, a urban district of 680 60,000 people in chengdu, has chosen to make a great deal of image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented his police street in urban of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police one side dégrossie soft, the more women.
Unfortunately, even scarlett johansson could have difficulties to attract the subterranean look at this urban brigade of china
And for cause, critics will.
Unlike the police agents, these are allowed to enforce the prescriptions municipal by imposing fines or other sanctions administrative.
But chinese media painted the news from a different reality.
In january 2008, the inspectors of the province of hubei beaten to death, an observer after he used his cell phone for the filmed in the process of disperse a protest against dumping of waste.
The last year, a manuel training for the beijing, supplanted inspectors and online, described how defeat effectively sinners without issue blood.
This year in shanghai, a colporteur of pastèques has been abandoned injuries must brain after a bagarre with five officers.
A game stinks of violence, available for download online, shows inspectors chinese street trained to the onslaught of sellers.
"Chengguan marked the last year 's government," has felt the china daily, a national publication, after a énième debates about the tactics.
The newspaper réclamait a true "comprehensive cleansing."
Skeptics say that the approach is far.
After the district has spent an announcement in october to find eight new recruits feminine, an editorial, published in the beijing evening news, wondered if women had real tasks or if they were a entertainment tourism.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the old district required female candidates, between 18 to 22 years, to have a beautiful figure and "the five traits of face in the good order."
They must have a size superior to the average, or $1.6 feet or 5 feet, 2 ½ pouces.
Retired to 26 years is compulsory.
The officers have said that the labor was physically too painful for women more than 25 years.
"It is their images that is important," said a certain district officer the rednet. com, a web site quasi - government.
"First, the qualities external candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, traits' s face, etc"
Then comes the character and the "internal qualities."
Women of chengguan are as vases to flowers, he said, saying: "in more of being vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng lihua, deputy director of the board of the city district management, adheres to this description.
But he noted that the demands about equal were the norm standard in many chinese offers of employment for both sexes.
Such is the case of the exigeance relative to the order of traits of face.
This means that may be a subject of debate among the chinese.
Of course, the persons with disabilities or défigurées should not postuler.
"We cannot let someone who boite or a bossu come serve here," said mr. zheng.
"It would not a good image."
Liu yi, which country on the place baoguang nearly a monastery, is aged 22, and the joues pommelées with an extra mouth finely incurvées.
It does not view the value of its appearance as gender - based, at - she says.
"Do you think i the air sexy outfits in this uniform?" she asked to disillusioned air.
Xu yang, his colleague to fossettes aged 21 years, says: "our work is present the image of the city."
They do not oppose that their term is limited, they said, because they foster greater ambitions of his career than simply displace the sellers in byways where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen merchants traveling who move quickly to walk or bicycle, by trying to sell the longer possible to small breads or bols of tofu before take flight.
"Wang, you must leave master."
"We you have already words several times!," mrs xu then said that a seller has enfui, abandoning temporarily his bicycle on foot - carts to noodles.
The agents describe their functions rather as monotonous that tricky.
"It is roughly the same every day," said huang jing, aged 20 years, which studying the marketing after the job.
"Great routine."
One reason is that the agents female don 't have the power of their male counterparts confiscating the goods sellers.
They cannot that threaten to signal the male offenders to their superiors.
It tends to protect public displays sudden of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common in china.
This year, hundreds of citizens to kunming, the capital of the province of yunnan, are incensed after the spread of false rumors which the agents of chengguan had killed a seller.
Overnight, more than a dozen police agents and the government 's chengguan were injured, 14 vehicles have been overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks away homes in the placide place baoguang, where the officers of women sex patrouillaient this morning, more than 50 people assembled around the corner.
The agents have come a motorcycle who was being réparée on the trottoir rather than in a shop, as their own imposes regulation.
The owner of a motorcycle cried scandal.
An iron arm of 15 minutes followed before the police, in the face grim, have spawned a way to contend to their vehicle and are parties to speed, with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40 years, a coordonnateur attached to the male team, remained behind, his badge white returned to hide his name.
As the women officers of sex, coordinateurs - old men of 40 years or more - play a role of support.
Unlike they, they are not trained in order to maintain an image cirée.
"Sometimes, we fight shout."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said mr. li said of a tone neutral.
"Most of the time, it is the public that begins."
The prosecutors inculperont not senator ensign
The prosecutors of the ministry of justice have lifted the criminal charges filed on senator john ensign, comes from a matter related to aide of a former campaign and its efforts to gain a work of lobbying for husband the woman, have anoncé wednesday lawyers of senator.
The decision ceding to the most serious threat legal faced by mr. ensign, the republican of nevada that was seen as a possible republican candidate for the 2012 presidential until the scandal surrounding its case will not make headlines national last year and hurt his career.
The office of mr. ensign has said that it was "very happy" by the decision, result of a survey of a year.
Senator might still be exposed to disciplinaires measures taken by the senate committee of ethics.
Advocates of mr. ensign have said that the ministry of justice had "informed that the senator ensign was more the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain charges any against him in this case."
The justice department has refrained from comment about this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many lawyers ethics external in the ministry of justice, according to which it would significant evidence showing that mr. ensign have federal criminal conspired to violate a ban on the lobbying.
Interviews, of e - mail and other documents, first transmitted in october 2009 in the new york times, reported that mr. ensign had helped douglas hampton, which was one of its aides, to get a job of lobbying lucrative to win the silence of mr. hampton and his wife, cynthia, about the case of senator with it.
Mrs hampton once served as trésorière in a campaign of ensign.
Mr. ensign has used a number of political lenders to find labor to mr. hampton and, second, he defended their rights after they have committed mr. hampton to make the lobbying for them; according to documents and interviews.
Given that mr. hampton had recently been a collaborator of mr. ensign, he was banned for a year by the law to of the senate lobbying with his former employer or as a whole.
Experts in ethical have argued that the unusual agreement between mr. ensign and mr. hampton, who were friends before the case, seems to contradiction with the ban dubbed the revolving door of lobbying.
After the evidence who has been made public, "there seemed to be proof prima facie of a conspiracy in view of rape and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said stanley brand, a lawyer in washington who specializes in defense of a survey by the government 's clients.
Although the judge of the ministry has refused to explain the reasoning having led to the decision in the case ensign, mr. brand lawyers and other in ethics have said that the ministry appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of a setback cash by his section of the integrity of high - level public last year, including the decision to abandon the prosecution against the former senator ted stevens accused of fault pursuit.
The federal prosecutors have clearly fear of take up arms, has said melanie sloan, the director general of citizens for the responsibility and ethics in washington, a group of defense who received many complaints against mr. ensign in the case.
"This basically says high - ranking government officials can now assume the laws don 't apply to them," she added.
Paul coggins, a lawyer main mr. ensign, said in an interview that he had received the monday a telephone call on the part of a prosecutor of the ministry of justice and monitoring the next day, him saying that the ministry sought not accusations against his client.
The team of lawyers of mr. ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade that senator, such as his office has reaffirmed wednesday in a statement, "had acted according to the rule of law."
Mr. coggins has refused to specify the legal arguments that he had made in the prosecutor.
"I am not to ease to enter the details of my conversations with the justice ministry, except to say that we believe that they have taken the right decision," at - he says.
Last month, the commission of federal elections has decided to abandon a survey following an independent complaint by the group of ethics, arguing that the payment of 96.000 $by mr. ensign parents at the federal hampton violated the electoral law.
The electoral commission has declared that it was not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
Nv energy, an important society of nevada that has long supported senator, is a company to which mr. ensign helped mr. hampton find labor of lobbying.
A e - mail sent in december 2008 has shown that, after the enterprise has greeted mr. hampton as lobbyist, the chief of staff of mr. ensign, john lopez, interaction with mr. hampton and him said that he "martelait" the ministry of the interior on an issue in litigation.
Mr. ensign has also participated in a lunch with mr. hampton and another client of nevada, allegiant air transport, and he asked secretary to set a meeting in the name of the airline having engaged mr. hampton to lobbying.
When the new case have surfaced last year, mr. ensign apologized to its voters and resigned from his post of the fourth largest republican leader in the senate.
After have maintained a low profile for several months, mr. ensign has declared two weeks ago that he intends to run a third term in the senate.
In announcing that mr. ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, its spokesman, jennifer cooper, has said that senator hoped that the ethics committee quickly follow the example of the ministry of justice and end to his investigation.
Senator ensign happy to pursue its hard work in the name of the people of nevada, said it.
The call of cheshire pointera to twitter
A half - dozen of them were now banging away in the rangées of him the courtroom.
They were consigning all the minutes reports of reporting horrible via twitter.
In the end, the defense has said that there were more of 140,000 messages about the trials of the case of rape and children attached to their beds in a house, which has been incendiée.
By thursday the trial largely followed of steven j. hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the family cheshire, in the connecticut official, should lead to an end when the judge impose the death penalty, passed by the jury.
But lawyers of mr. hayes have already lay the elements in court that esquissent of the arguments appeal, likely to fill the courts for years.
What is provocant, it is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists of twitter - have created a "atmosphere of circus," glut if widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury has been poorly influenced by the public 's passions.
The demand could push the judges to call to debate the question of whether the new technologies demand in the new rules rooms courtroom.
"I experience in of this trial, i believe that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the rooms of hearing diminishes the rights of the person to a fair trial," said thomas j. ullmann, a lawyer of mr. hayes, lawyer chief.
The judge the trial, jon c. blue of the laconiquement superior of state, court rejected claims in the judgment last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by the passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Prices of 's call for decades recognize that the media coverage cases known predictors can rouse questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966 who has been date, the us supreme court has canceled condemnation of a ostéopathe of cleveland, dr sam sheppard, for the assassination of his wife, underpinning in its decision that there was a "atmosphere of media carnival in" because trial.
The crime is regarded by some of having been the inspiration for the emission of television and the movie "fugitive."
Some lawyers have declared that the courts appeal welcomed to revise half a century later the condemnation of mr. hayes may be curious, given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the means of communication rooms of hearing, unthinkable at the time of the case of dr sheppard.
General "there is a reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the trial of scale, john i said. donohue iii, a professor at stanford school of law which studied the death penalty to connecticut and wrote a report according to which it has been arbitrarily applied.
The professor donohue asserts that some judges to call could be puzzled by the idea that limit the communication instantaneously from the rooms of hearing more just could trials.
The case of twitter is that a among many others described by lawyers to mr. hayes, likely to be discussed for years, which retards the execution.
Advocates of defense also argue, for example, that mr. hayes might have suffered a prejudice when the judge blue refused to enable them to test the reactions potential sworn in their showing pictures macabres scenes criminal at the selection of the jury.
Some have declared sworn have been horror by the photos of victims, jennifer hawke - small, 48 years, and his girls, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years.
Defense lawyers claim that they will also contest constitutionality of the death penalty and that they support that the judge unjustly expelled one of sworn, which had been critical to the prosecutors, and he ostentatiously put pressure for a verdict by taking the decision to bring the jury unusually to délibérer in a weekend.
The sworn have not been séquestrés.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trials may be the greatest source of interest.
They note in a protest against the verdict, left last month, that the case dominated the pan media in the connecticut and that he was discussed for the electoral campaign by the candidates for the post of governor and in the united states senate.
They have maintained that the media computer stopped of fanning the flames of emotion of the matter.
"The daily bousculade of tweets media, cameras and journalists before the palace of justice," wrote lawyers, "looked to what had been seen before here, to new haven, and perhaps even to the national."
Their focused on the mantle of twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists have said that the claim, according to which new incendiary instantaneous were more than the communiqués issued more slowly, was a luddiste who appauvrirait the politics of the court governing the coverage of future trial.
But some lawyers have said that the call étaitent often attirées by the arguments that social changes and technological commanded a adaptation by the courts.
Advocates of mr. hayes insist on this claim.
In their file, they are a reference to the decision of the supreme court of 1966 who had depose the condemnation of dr sheppard because of the coverage of the trials, and they have said that they invoqueraient need new rules for the new media.
"This affair," wrote - they ," is that of sheppard v. maxwell assembled in the 21st century."
The civility can bring the cleavages?
After a campaign marked by the invective and the négativité, a modicum of civility erupted in washington this week.
Is it to a harbinger of a bi - partisan real cooperation forward or a moment illusory before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting of mardi between president barack obama and the leaders of the congress has produced no breakthrough on the big issues that must be treated over the session of the "lame duck."
But at least obviously, there has been a discussion polite on the differences on both sides as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to settle scores. vacuum rating point advocate.
The meeting public wednesday of the commission on the deficit of president has been equally civilized, despite the divergence policies that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the interaction close of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but that, however, divides members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation is arrival.
The two sides are now in a period of trial and mutual test in order to obtain signs of cooperation and of compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and patience voters for a renewed partisan war.
This is why the meeting of mardi and commentary subsequent of participants laid a minimum requirements or charges of.
The philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
As it is both the taxes, health care spending, or the rights, the two sides remain nautical to distance.
Yet, the election of november had moderate washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said pete wehner, an official of the bush administration, now the side of the center of ethics and public policy.
"It is inevitable after the election.
The elections have spread partisan passions and, second, they estomptent.
It is right. "
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the round of "lame duck," the republicans and democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The bush tax cuts of expireront at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or all permanently, or temporary.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefit, if only because the republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of the tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits the unemployed workers.
After the meeting of mardi in the white house, more optimism hanging over a possible agreement about discussed during the relative session in "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "new start."
But william galston put it, the brookings institution, warned that successful on the cooperation of the most pressing problems session "globalization duck" ménera not necessarily to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112e congress meets later in january.
Instead, he says, a period is likely to disagree, if not inevitable.
"Once things that must be made will, the psychology in the short term return to the confrontations," he said.
Wehner has also expressed skepticism widely shared according to which the civility lead to a genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre - spectacle or a shadow - boxing relative to the event main in 2012, at - he says.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new republican majority in the house and voters in the tea that have helped to its creation.
But the leaders republicans are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they should try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first responses to recommendations of the commission deficit who understand to reform the tax code and increase some taxes, to diminish the age of retirement, and reduce the spending.
The erskine and co - presidents alan simpson bowles chose the one of the most difficult tasks in washington and have, by themselves, imposed the question of public deficit on the agenda of a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need to 14 votes to the commission, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had trouble to meet this number.
The greatest resistance epochal among the group 's elected, which suggests that there is on the fiscal matters, at least today, little of motives or will compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fighting between the white house and the republicans in congress.
The first will come next year in the form of clashes supporters, given that republicans competitors obama in the budget, taxes and health care; for then be followed by a period of greater cooperation bipartisan.
What is the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely shown that, despite the mind advocate of the recent election, a majority of americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, when the two parties observeront closely to the public reaction.
That that will be tried in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
Nevertheless, but it would be a view optimistic.
The spirit and partisan polarization are taller today than they were in the mid - 1990 's and there seemed to have a greater ideological gap between obama and the republicans congress that there were then between the president bill clinton and the republicans.
In the same time, the two parties activists see 2010 as a mere prelude to a larger in 2012 election.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many americans.
But it will take much more of efforts on the part of the two parties to find common ground on the issues that divide them still.
Documents americans divulgués describe moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "kleptocracy" and casts until the kremlin part of the bribes and money of protection that it seize, signaled the us embassy in russia in a note in february.
The police and the federal security service realize huge rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of life in moscow, he says.
They collect of the money not only of companies legitimate but also of organized criminals groups.
Each coat of the bureaucracy - what the prime minister vladimir putin has called the "vertical of power" - - takes its part as the money snakes to the top of the scale.
The bill for service, which was sent to washington under the name of the ambassador john beyrle, has been postée wikileaks wednesday on its web site.
The bill is based on the names of which have been expurgés sources.
It was drafted while yuri luzhkov was still mayor of moscow, and it is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was congédié in october by president dmitri medvedev but there has since been little traces of cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, elena batourina, which has a firm construction of prime plan charges of corruption, have always denied over the years; and he won many trials in defamation on these charges.
In september, he declared this to a russian tv station, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "it is crazy, it is to throw, it is nonsense."
Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the intelligence laid down in debriefing of embassy; and it is inouï to design that this would be to foreign diplomats of a country to do so.
The direct link established between the government of the moscow city and the crime has led some in the name of "dysfunctional" and to assert that the government worked more like a kleptocracy that a government, "according to the bill for the embassy.
"The criminals enjoy elements of a" krysha " (term used in the world 's mafia - criminal / which literally means" roof "or protection) passing through the police, the federal security service (fsb), the ministry of the interior (mvd) and the prosecutor' s office, as well as across the bureaucracy moscow city 's government.
"Analysts to identify a structure for three levels in the world criminal to moscow."
"Luzhkov is the summit."
"The fsb, the mvd, and the militias are second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and the inspectors corrupt are at the lowest."
"It is a system ineffective in which groups criminals add a vacuum in some areas where the city provides no some services."
The report noted that the fsb brasse money of the largest companies and that the police target the small.
A source, he said, "argued that owners of corporate moscow understand that it was better to get the protection of the mvd and the fsb (rather than groups of organized crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more and more power means that the criminals groups but they are also protected by the law."
"It is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The signs that, although the reports collection of the money is extended, protection itself can be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken of several times the fight against corruption but he admitted the little progress.
The bill for the embassy transmits accounts warning of the men who provide valises, probably met of money, until the kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview gueorgui satarov, director of the "think tank indem" of moscow.
"But it is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because there is not in russia."
Without politics, without opposition, separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
According to the indem, the costs of corruption to rise, the scale of the entire russia, to more than $300 billion per year.

The former combatants khmer rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom evil enlightened with walls in concrete décrépits - quality, the director of the secondary school of the anlong veng spoke of the last man who had built, the head of the khmer rouge, discharged mok.
"Everyone here likes discharged mok."
"It was a good leader, and worried about his people," said sreng kor my, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was the head of the khmer rouge, this commander remains popular in this bastion isolated former khmer rouge in northwestern cambodia where he has build hospitals, bridges, and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the khmer rouge arrived in government, the loyalty of long standing is finally challenge to anlong veng.
In april, a local forum of truth and reconciliation has allowed victims of face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In june, the government is distributed handbook of high school that, for the first time, teaching history of the khmer rouge to children of its former soldiers.
And, in july, a tribunal cambodia, jointly led with the united nations, made his first sentence concerning a former member of the khmer rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former chief 's infamous center of torture tuol sleng, kaing khek iev, better known as "duch."
To this evolution of the situation, the anxiety has grown from the former combatants khmer rouge of anlong veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wishes to improvement in cambodia society.
"There are resentments and fear among the old khmer rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said chhang youk, director of the center of documentation of cambodia, an independent body that leads of research on the regime.
"For them, life under the khmer rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates of divisions within families."
Under the khmer rouge rule in cambodia, 1975 - 1979, around 1.7 million people have been executed or died of starvation, disease, or surmenage.
When the vietnamese have invaded and depose the pol pot us government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to cambodia 's border with thailand.
Here, they have launched a insurrection that lasted until the last travel in december 1998 movements.
While pol pot, nuon chea and ieng sary ruled guerrilla warfare of their base located in the mountains of the west in cambodia and, in the jungle discharged mok preparing a following anlong veng.
But in the mid - 1990 's, after a peace agreement backed by the un has led to the first country' s democratic elections in 1993, major of combatants khmer rouge groups have begun to do in government, culminating with the capitulations defection of ieng sary in 1996 and nuon chea and khieu samphan in 1998.
Pol pot died of natural in 1998, and causes discharged mok, who stood up, has been captured by the government forces in 1999 dangrek near in the mountains.
He died in a prison from phnom penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former combatants khmer rouge have become in the squalor of cambodia, and many rural, common to regions are those who remain nostalgic the movement.
Although some elite officers khmer rouge have kept their local leader in exchange for filed the weapons, it is of unskilled farmers' s low grade and issue.
"The people who have benefited from very little of followed after the collapse," said sok leang of the center for justice and reconciliation that holding forums public across the cambodia, including to anlong veng.
"They are saturated with the regime 's ideology utopian agrarian."
"They have been high in a framework where do business is a concept abroad."
Sor lim, 55 years old, which has joined the khmer rouge as teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around anlong veng before to settle in 1998 as poor rice growing.
"Life under the khmer rouge was good," he said.
"Discharged mok feeds the entire world."
But now, life is difficult because we must pay to our own needs. "
The khmer rouge underway tribunal has also caused concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, begin the judgment of nuon chea, khieu samphan, ieng sary and his wife, ieng thirith, another former minister khmer rouge.
The court 's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and most responsible for crimes but he did not say if it pursued beyond of these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears about the anlong veng.
The recent speculation media have moved into the chaem, aged 64 years, former chief district in the province of banteay meanchey under the khmer rouge rule in the 1970 's.
In 2007, she said to scientists at the center of documentation of cambodia that it had oversaw the construction of the dam in trapeang thma, a project where thousands of convict laborers would have died.
Recently, in a labor blistering night, in chaem meant in field located nearly of their homes in wood on pilotis, on a path of land outside of anlong veng.
While the sun jetait long shadows on the grass desséchée, in chaem refused to discuss its past within the khmer rouge.
If the tribunal the convoquait, said it, it refused to do.
"The cambodia is in peace and stable," at - she says.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be the war."
Prime minister hun sen, who has made defection khmer rouge in 1978, has also warned repeatedly that a instability would happen if the tribunal pursued several suspected; although experts and historians this question.
"The cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, at - he says.
But confronting the past is what the cambodia must do to move forward, says youk chhang at the center of documentation.
"The reconciliation in terms khmer is reconnecter the pieces broken, he says.
"We need to these pieces together to that we can understand."
The center produced the first manuel approved by the government on the khmer rouge, "a history of kampuchea democratic, composed of 75 pages."
It has distributed to anlong veng in june as additional of history books the ministry of education, designed to the high schools, who contained less than four pages on the khmer rouge.
As in most of the cambodia, young people anlong veng will know that a few details about the khmer rouge, despite the ties of the city the regime.
Touch valeak, 19 years old, student in high school of anlong veng, has said that the new manuel helping the students to understand a substantial part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically when it is with the book income in the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manuel and the tribunal," he said.
"They are suspicious because they don 't know exactly how people the court continue."
Such a resistance has made the complex and difficult reconciliation process, has said sok leang.
But public forums, the manuel and the tribunal beginning to have an impact, at - he says.
Yet, the khmer rouge retain a atrait powerful here.
In the highlands mountains of dangrek, a path, invaded by the weediness and parsemé plastic bags, led up to a black soot rectangle, recouvert of a roof of tôle rouillée.
The body of pol pot was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, aged cell - phone 31 years ago, vendeuse near road, has said that it does not know much on the man who has been cremated to this place.
"But it has a great spirit, and many people there will for pray, said it.
It was the anniversary of nuom sothea and, later that day, it has been to walk to the rest last place of pol pot where it leave a bouquet of bananas mature in the hope that provide luck.
Belarus willingness to renounce its stock of uranium quality military
Belarus' s government has announced wednesday that he would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, a crucial component in the nuclear weapons; this décison is part of a surprise victory of president barack obama 's campaign to secure the nuclear materials in the world
The agreement has been divulgué in a statement joint released after secretary of state hillary rodham clinton belarusian met by the foreign minister, sergei martynov, in range of a summit on security.
The us government had tried for years to convince the belarus to give up the highly enriched uranium and appeared to have released the horizon last spring.
But american officials have declared the washington post that some classified have been made with belarus operations in the last two months to eliminate 187 books of uranium quality military from a center of belarus' s research.
This has opened the way to a wednesday agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about $500 books, according to an official who spoke of the condition of anonymity because of the sensibilities of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations, organized in the obama initiative; where belarus was ruled out.
Apparently, he has served to obtain an invitation to the ex - soviet republic in the wake of the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat on the nuclear security summit in 2012 nuclear security summit."
"It me shows that this process works," said ken luongo, president of the partnership for global security, a group of promoting nuclear security.
Clinton has called the agreement "very significant, important step" by belarus.
Obama has pledged in prague in april 2009 to secure all nuclear materials vulnerable throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the us government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the administration of george w. bush.
At a time of obama 's nuclear security summit, the belarusian president alexander lukashenko, has said that the nation never forgo its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium), hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially uranium of military quality and low - enriched uranium" mr. lukashenko, then said.
"It is our product... we are not produce bombs dirty, and we are to sell person."
"We use for research, it is."
Belarus moved the united states - few months ago; however, in signaling of interest to reach a settlement.
The first to eliminate uranium implementation of belarus, in october, has been particularly complicated, because the material had been slightly irradié, have indicated officials.
It has been charged on a special train that have come more than 300 nautical until a installation in russia to be stored and eliminated, have indicated officials.
The second operation was completed monday and has been achieved by aircraft, according to the responsible.
The us government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the installation of belarus' s research with low - enriched uranium; inadequate to the weapons.
"Careful coordination and an organization done have been exiled in labor in order to strengthen trust"; leading and to the agreement signed by the clinton administration, has declared andrew bieniawski, a responsible for the department of energy world specialist in reducing the threat.
According to estimates by the center of etude of nonprolifération james martin, belarus had this year at least 88 books of uranium quality, as well as hundreds of military kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate their inventories by 2012, according to a joint declaration.
Relations between belarus and the united states are fraught for years, mainly owing to the hard repression by lukashenko of human rights.
But the declaration of a potential revival wednesday suggested.
"While commending progress on these issues of global security, the united states, and belarus have recognized that a increased respect for democracy and human rights in belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and indispensable the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.

Members of the popular 4 gain seats in the congress party and the sgp in lose 9
With the results of 18 -, the pp could be decisive in the municipes of lérida, tarragona and barcelona.
After the large votes and deputies recorded in the recent elections autonomiques, the pp catalan has already attacked the general because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training achieved in the comices double normally that it receives in the catalanes.

Both nationalists as the popular are agreement with the fact that sgp could lose the mairies barcelona, tarragona, lérida and gerona, where the socialists get the majority not more the possibility of using their traditional partners, erc and icv.
In that take into account the republican debacle, it is not fanciful that this training loses its representation in the city of barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the vote.
The pp has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a force decisively in barcelona, lérida and tarragona.
The nationalist are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital tarragona, where they governed with the pp before the current socialist mayor, josep felix ballesteros.
To lérida, the pp recorded only a difference of 500 votes relative to sgp, including the mayor, àngel ros, keeps a very good relations with mariano rajoy - during this last campaign, they are found themselves several times.

Sabadell betting on steal a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic that other leaders, the director delegated at banco sabadell, jaime guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a year hard for the banking sector, but rejects initially a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war 'liabilities.
Despite this, he sees a collapse of the margins of interests, that you try to compensate partly with incréments commissions and prices of credit.
Sabadell capture expect a million in three years of retail customers, its task.
Sabadell found a way to exploit for the future three years and power survive so in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will in motion in 2011, a new master plan that will hold a will labilité three years.
The goal, apart from survive without need to resort to public subsidies frob, is to win approval ratings market by the diversion of one million new retail customers - 700,000 if one inferred those that can grow out of bank - its great task, because so far this bank had gâté more the pmes and societies that the particular client.
This year he caught 300,000 retail customers and 50,000 societies.
His ratings of market for individuals is 3.5%, while the societies it exceeds the 10%.
Another basis of 2011 - 2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs as goal, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare to targets and make public, because the financial crisis has troubled all plans banking sector.
Sabadell, indeed, finalisera this year his master plan optima, established there are too four years, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the situation of the market has determined its continuation for an exercise more.
Customers that leave escape the coffers of savings will be its main goal.
For a small - lunch organized by apie, guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be a year "difficult and transcendantale."
The executive branch, indeed, thinks that the exit from the crisis in spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years, this will "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental for the survival of the matter, insisted he banking.
And even if he believes that the war of - liabilities that penalized the margins - reduced, the price of risk premia that banks and pay for its coffers emissions for liquidity move already the price of credit to compensate for the fall of margins.
"The aspect of the liquidity and the funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not shake the spigot, but are differentials top," has recognized guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to his network to limit the long - term credit and raise the price of differentials - see cincodías of 22 and 27 november.
It also has declared that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions," but "there is a framework competitive."
The head of sabadell plan is based on growth organic even if, as always, the group eliminates not the possibility of realize corporatives operations.
This is not that it assures that in spain in vain "sollicitera more big dimensions."
"Any move the next year," has secured he.
He argues that the needs of capital "rise hugely" red spanish and financial some entity could entering the numbers.
And it mention that the frob can replace the market in the diversion of funds into the case of new recapitalizations.
After assured that sabadell can survive the fence temporal the markets, it has decreased the importance of the fact that some bank predict already as a new crisis of liquidity.
It reports that you cannot issue, but instead of what has happened in june, one can get the short - term funding through ridges, which mitigate the crisis.
Ecsc rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the coffers
The ecsc, josé director general antonio olavarrieta yesterday, has rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings and loan mergers and insisted on again the speed with which executes restructuring sector.
When the trial of concentration of savings and loan spanish began, there has been several entities that have ensured that they did not participate in the first phase, and that they would get for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director - general of the spanish confederation of savings and loan (ecsc), josé antonio olavarrieta yesterday, has rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of mergers has been achieved, one cannot say that the incorporation of cajasol in the group of banca cívica is a second phase, this are adjustment."
"Most was achieved completely; it is possible that instead of 17 there to 13 or 14, but all the major process have been achieved already under the tutelage of the bank of spain, which has collaborated many in this operation also," has emphasized the leader.
In the declarations for a small - lunch of the association of leaders and executive of aragón (adea), olavarrieta argued that the process of concentration materialize "to the greater speed possible and we need to be very satisfied with the way that it materialize in time that has been set in the past, not now in the plans of business with the bank of spain," has emphatisé he.
"The passage from 45 state coffers with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets at 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, by reducing the number of entities, 62% for that they are much more big to be conforms to basel," has emphasized he.
Olavarrieta has recognized that "there is a series of views quite happy on the slow pace of process" showing "a lack of sérosité and meaning," because "what the bank of spain is reminded that we should respect the delay before the end of the year."
The ecsc, josé director general antonio olavarrieta, has secured yesterday that spain has the financial system the most stringent all europe, and "probably" of the world, and he attributed to people who the doubt a "lack of knowledge."
The leader has mentioned that, given the current economic times, "we can be very tranquilles" with the situation of financial entities and savings and loan, a system that began a process of concentration "very important" and "will at the speed, much as possible."
It also has reminded that the spanish banking sector has raised hardship of stress that ecb has accomplished in july.
Zapatero and the red line german
Berlin has opted for remain in the euro, but he has established the conditions for the union.
The tensions markets have provoked a government doble response.
On one hand, josé luis rodríguez zapatero announced new ways of adjustment, which vary of tax cuts for the pmes, regulatory agencies private of institutionalization or suppression of 426 euros to help unemployed professional without contribution to the privatization of 49% of aena, the management of barajas airports and al prat and 30% of lotteries of the state.
Of another, the vice - president elena salgado, with the support of the former president, felipe gonzález, chancellor angela merkel is uniting to criticism of the regarding its responsibility to lift the current crisis.
How should interpret these movements?
It should be mention that merkel 's position is not a mistake in its policy communicative.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of difficult process redefinition of the euro.
And here, germany has a radically new view of what must be its future, the former traditions that shocks with that of most of its partners.
The eu 's resistance, germany, the face of one starts to speculate on three possible out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, austria and holland, among other countries, and the south abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of mark, even if now seems of science fiction, with a current opinion very favorable, close to a 50% of the population.
The third, a new vision of the euro, in line with the german proposals for a greater control macro - economic, budget discipline, fines to countries that the transgressent, possible disruptions of payments on one of them and extension the private sector potential adjustment costs.
The german position is clear, and it is long as it defines itself, thus now there is no place for an apology.
First, in 2009, when both imf as the european commission stimulaient deficits, the german government has invented a constitutional reforms to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of dispute between what germany thought that we should do (plans of fiscal stringency and stability of public finances) and that its european partners, these - includes france, used.
The second blow of center - european country has been when merkel has hardly prolonged the decision to save greece.
From this point it has been the subject of a devastating critique, but the truth is that the political consensus in germany and the public opinion and the published were against the rescue of greece.
Finally, towards the end of october, merkel 's new expresses a clear position, asking the addition of treaties to the union to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time to private lenders to carry a share of the cost.
This has been interpreted as anti - european position, because it has precipitated the irish crisis, and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little édulcorée, has been approved, and, the next month, we should see the process reshaping of the union that is possible these measures to from 2013.
Germany has developed a red line that it don 't think croiser.
And it now we are told all that, even if one should take steps with whom you may not be too agreement, from that date the former functioning of the euro would have come.
2013 mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries that transgressent rules will be severely punished, they can be forced to stated in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector bear also a party of the costs.
Germany reports that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rate of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and soldes external positive.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one who has thrived spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The is clear.
And it would be wrong to not heard.
It is not only to extend the budget deficit in 3% in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what it needs to do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence let happen to us a quiet more.
And knows seize the opportunity that we gave, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president zapatero has also course of this form and its double declaration (the reformes promised saturday after the meeting of the past with the large companies and yesterday 's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite critics of merkel, it has opened the way to suspect that he should get order at home.
But the red line that germany has forged is, and they don 't seem to the move.
And among the opportunities that one approaches, one cannot rule out that to abandon a monetary zone too full of countries little serious.
And here, germany we can argue that it in had warned.
Sport and fraud of the law
The trick similar to that of alonso and ramos against ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion ourdie in principle by two real madrid (xabi players alonso and sergio ramos) during the game of november 23 against ajax in the champions' league has flowing many tampering on the anti - sporting character of such behavior, and if the two players should be disciplined by the uefa.
As it knows, a few minutes before to finish the match (that their team already earned clearly), the two players have deliberately lost time when they have committed misconduct to determine the referee to demonstrate the second yellow card.
For example, and seen as real madrid will eventually be leader of its group, the two players accompliront the sanctions regulatory during the next match the dam against match auxerre and able to pass without shelf to the next phase.
Finally, the discipline of uefa committee has dropped with two games coach of the team, josé mourinho and different economic are to players involved.
The provocation of a card yellow in similar circumstances like it or not a new practice, soccer otherwise rather common in the world.
It is so widespread than it is part of the ethos, non - rules written, but followed, the sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the case relaté should the fact that this has been as protagonist a team of the entity of real madrid (which in its poster the pessimistic anthem and honor and that in opportunities past has condemned to a fine its players to a similar actions), and orchestrated dramatizing, it seems, by mourinho, which adds a episode of more to its dilatée history histrionique technician and provocative.
In any case, the debate about whether such behavior not forbidden explicitly by the settlement contradicts the principles of sports, it is - - say, if with these actions committing a fraud law; indeed, because they are actions abiding with the settlement sporting, but seem to evade his sense.
The question is to examine the type of prejudice they cause to mind sporting.
One of goods that understands the mind sporting is the physical integrity of the adverse players, something that with these actions has not been endangers, it is - - there has not been a violent game.
Another of these goods that it means with the correct is preventing the team game of players infracteurs team benefits of a unfair way to the contrary, what is not the case, either.
However, the fact paradoxical of the action of players in the real madrid is that it will not fundamentally to what one normally as cheating o fraud of characterizes the law, because its violation of rules has not been achieved in resume to try to avoid the sanctions, but their action was precisely tried to be the most obvious way to receive the criminalization of the referee.
They expected and accepted engage the sanctions.
Another question is the kind of advantage that the infracteurs get the meaning mistakes is addressed.
Here it seems necessary that one does not reflect in a situation of at rival disadvantage and one gets an advantage in the same match not more, because obviously, the result of the action assumes the fact to allow their own team with less than players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next game not more, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course, advantage is in the fact that the players begin the next phase of the champions' league without carry that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long - term advantage, with a degree of ambiguity, because the team could be eliminated any coup and to share this, with this action players achieve a football match sanctions and spend the second round of shelf, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of shelf happens with a less than in the first round.
, So that climb the top, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to mind sporting, which is when even part the decisions that favor strategic profit maximum of what the rules can.
In our case, the players have not actionné to avoid the implementation of the sanctions (indeed, this would be a clear case of fraud of the law), mr otherwise, they have chosen rather the moment in which they are subject to it.
They have made a strategic decision without blunt the penalty either flee that.
Even if the border between the genie and fraud of the law is disseminates, in this opportunity i believe that there was a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems, appears to me cause of two factors: because there were two self - expulsions and because of the way to leave the director for the cause.
The evil fueled the principles of sports by these actions is not as much as aesthetics ethics.
Hawk offered to capture the dinners christmas for groups in bcn
The dictatorship timing concentrated an avalanche of réservations this year for the 16 - 17 days.
There is a proliferation of self - celebrations by the employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the touron and the lottery, when december comes return also the dinner groups before the christmas that continue to be the ball of oxygen to restaurants and entertainment barcelona, but who because of the crisis have lead in an offensive either price adjusted to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide businessmen and associations sector interviews.
To complete make the accounting, timing of this year (like the night of the saint sylvestre falls friday) has concentrated calls in the week of the december 13, having as results so far an avalanche of réservations to dinners for the peak (the 17 and the 17 days earlier) and almost nothing the week.
Since 2008, which is the root of times, there are too many companies that have eliminated the budget dinners collective for reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize by paying of their own pockets.
Any is the point, they ask all prices of battle, confirms the president of gremi from restauració barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The high representative of the patronale now, dare not to predict how will be the holiday this month.
"The people many before reserve considers."
"They want to release, but they pay little attention on price," mentions he.
The case will go well, "for those who give quality cheaply and with a good" service, it added, and reminds us that customers have the tendency to take a level with the crisis, so that the tranche of around 25 euros became majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions of the center is the collapse of demands for the night of 17.
The group soteras indicates that there is a genuine boom of demands for this friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, in which they have responded by adapting their menus to complete the times, with formulas 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, andilana, with 16 institutions in the town hostal of rita, market, the established and other), the timing has uniqueness supposed more of early réservations, even at the beginning of the november.
"We have made the impossible to maintain the same price of the past year, with menus for all the tastes of 19,95 to 30 euros," they détaillent -.
Year grup, which includes al mussol, attic, ququ and a total of local 23, remains optimistic after detected a billing since the second half boom and good, though concentrated, business prospects for the christmas.
The sources of group point that the 18 will be a day hyper - active in level groups of friends who celebrate in advance the holiday.
To their six menus of group they have added a for the christmas, with 30 euros or more as budget famous and the perception of that there is a susceptibility to spend a 10% more than the past year instead of demand more of the details, such as wine catalan maker according to the method champenoise - cava.
They see as the first signs of improvement in some companies call for their employees and the sensations that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the patronat fecasarm (which includes entities as the association of its bars, restaurants and entertainment barcelona), his vice - president, enric gomà, entrusts in the possibility of begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall réservations are "animées," even if the customers "negotiate maximum."
This is true, the hope regarding the festivities did not falling, regardless of who pays, he says.
The pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern in the united states
Islamabad product of atomic weapons to "a faster pace than any that other countries."
The wikileaks filtrations confirms the connection between the taliban and pakistan.
The content of corresponds between the us embassy in pakistan and the department of the state of the united states filtrée by the wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns that causes to washington portal pakistan 's nuclear program.
Apart from the details éclairants and savoureux that offer on the content and conversations thoughts of representatives diplomatic north american accredited in islamabad, documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the area of the atomic security, instead of increase, "décroît" and that the unstable asian country produces "nuclear weapons to a faster pace than any other country of the world."
The uniqueness pakistan 's nuclear program - - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make it difficult their destruction in case of attack - - is a major reasons of trouble in washington.
It is as well as the ambassador in pakistan anne w. patterson, énumère in a report before the visit of the former advisor to national security, james jones: "the proximity of some territory under attack taliban 's nuclear facilities, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise short and the vulnerability of the atomic transport materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals, and in the missile is considered programs, not only by the united states, but also by russia, as proliférant and a reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has of hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear installations, given the decline of cultural and educational levels, the extremists organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programs or missiles" said the expert yuri korolev, the ministry of russian external during a meeting with his american counterparts.
The new of the documentation filtrée by the portal julian assange is whenever smaller cooperation between the united states and pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the pakistani high degree of production of nuclear armas.
A start of the embassy in may, which calls as "frustrating" communication with pakistan, supports the following: "the transparency is frequently non - existent; the offers of help left unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, peter lavoy, official of national intelligence for the south asia, says that "despite the economic catastrophe, pakistan product of the nuclear weapons to a faster pace than any other country of the world."
The ambassador patterson also requires in washington, during a visit of the army chief, general ashfaq kayani, that he do understand "very clear" the charge that "the pakistan army must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
Wikileaks to the chase chief
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for the anti - terrorist to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol casts a red alert to follow the movements and locate assange.
All the aspects to wikileaks and its founder julian assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have an certainty on the facts.
Yesterday interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements of" assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, otherwise it datte of the 20 november.
And it has nothing to even with the last filtration of more than a quarter million of diplomatic documents the united states but with the charges of sexual abuse that the australian faces in sweden.
In addition, the wikileaks creator, mark stephens lawyer, ensures that "the police knows where and how to mr. assange."
The international 20 the body policeman with the siege on lyon (france) has dictate order in sweden 's demand, but it has not public until then, after having received the authorities' s authorization of that country.
Thus, the 188 interpol countries have received the indication to identify or locate assange "for his arrest provisionnelle and his extradition."
Even if interpol cannot give the order of the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many between the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, see the call red notice a free to the national arrest - - that the body of the police must realize -, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of sweden and england, where one thinks that assange is.
The the lawyers of assange has outraged movement, which yesterday have published a letter dénonceant the fact that the wikileaks founder, 39 years, has shown willing to respond by video conference to questions of swedish authorities.
They also remember that assange has demanded and securing the allowed out of sweden prosecutor of his case, that you compare the famous lavrentiy pavlovich beria, head of the security stalin.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legally persecuting," denounces the missive.
While the world the seeks - and in australia his mother defends innocence of his son - - assange continues to be found in a place unknown, but he will not leaves out.
The monday he gave at an indeterminate place an interview to head of the journal time through skype, a conversation, in which he asked the resignation of the united states, secretary of state hillary clinton.
"If you can show that it has been responsible for ordering the graduates americans that they épient to the un raping the international treaties that the united states has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by press secretary of the white house, robert gibbs, who has called as "ridiculous and absurd" demand of resignation.
"I am not at all course why the opinion of a kind with a web page should look," said he for the cnn.
Obama himself has appointed a high responsible for the anti - terrorist, rusell through, prevent of new leaks of documents.
The test of president barack obama 's spokesman to reduce the importance of the assange contrasts with the opinions that politicians and conservative commentators declare these days.
Peter king, congressman who from january chairs the national security in the lower house committee has asked the department of the state that it studying the opportunity to include wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to capture its funds and continue to anyone who provide contributions or assistance."
Even more far went tom flanagan, a canadian advisor to president stephen harper, who has of return on his statements after said that assange will have "be killed."
"Obama should turn it into goal and use a plane without équipage or something similar."
A person who has not demanded an apology baptiste minister, has been mike huckabee, ex - arkansas governor and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Who lies in the government who was filtered information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be a punishment too amiable," said he for fox.

The party 's president is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not sufficient to the supporters of the former josep leader lluís carod - rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluée that his menteur and that this can absolutely not give him the ills of current head that he had with other éteints.
This is why the leader of esquerra try make its new criticism with clins of an eye that enable it to blinder until municipal elections.

Of the infectiologue it fate convinced: "the patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated with the traumatologue approach that has cut the winds amidst the corridor, but that explains that wound is not a term scientific; it is the psychanalyste that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what has opened in reality, the symbolic is scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concluded: "on the scourge i only have know that it is that is opened in reality, and it does not exist," but convinced the fact that the pleasures and the pitfalls of the language must be very related them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
The nicaragua sergio ramírez has exposed also a fetching narrative that he has entitled praised to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not nombré but at some point is found.
With touches of realism magic, he speaks of a famous ensorceleuse that particular clouds, was return of people who had gone far or réparait of virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narrative that vire to speak then america, the great new that has been from the beginning its own columnists and quoted to bernal díaz del castillo who berates the excess narratives capitans conquérants.
"Cervantes that we has invented all (the writers) has at the wrong witnesses who were in the stories presented as real, but of a aitre way you would never conté history of america with a imagination that lacked even of pudeur."
Nevertheless, has pointed out, "the crazy and menteurs have the best imagination" and here the reality converge with the lie, we will no longer know how much of the narrative belongs to a gang or another, where the fiction literature peaked.
We call this indeed the tradition of cervantes.
"It is thanks to his legacy that there is what one conte."

"I believe that the right literature, the good poetry good song enshrine a commitment tacit that is not, of course premeditated," said she says, after cite the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that has been established between the author and readers, and that it is a "response chemical" of this last.

He has seen that in a world that lives in high - speed also in which include habits intellectual and the control of consciences that turned to the benefit of dogmatismes, "behind every claim there is a small not and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and be masters of the reality, we must nuancer: and nuancer means many times ask the finger on the wound and worry that makes people feel very convenient thinking in caricature, white and black, established in ideas and without nuance and fester also in power who prefer a world in white and black," he said, by inviting to recapture the sense of write.

Rubén lost two final with the diablos rojos and with monterrey, his rival the tournament, therefore does not have the same fate, he tries to lift the maléfice to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, i want to break no statistical, this is a club, not for a passion that i and therefore i obtiendrai the title, but what i mentioned before is more important," has commented the chairman when asked what would be its weaknesses in the final.
He recalls a lot of the final last, to which it assures that he learned much, "the one lesson is that we can learn is that until the umpire siffle the final, we cannot celebrating, we are prepared to the line, the players, too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to and i believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game cannot be marking."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which don 't worry, because it entrusts into its players: "we will never seeks to escape the set of penalties, one tries to end in the steady, but sometimes we delay is that predates prepare, the tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a bad round, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to hold the title between our hands, hands we has eluded, it has served as lesson for this final and we hope that it is more in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be an under - champion and goûter technician for the first time the glory offered by the securities.

Illegal migration can proceed without problem
The conservatives bill of that, according to the government, should address the problem of boats responsible for undocumented migrants, will obviously be defeated while the three opposition parties have know wednesday that they could not rely.
"I relies strongly on the charter."
"I am getting standing with a party that created the granite under your feet," said the chief liberal michael ignatieff, while it was surrounded by deputies after holding the meeting weekly of caucus.
Liberals claim that the project of such as proposed law, which would hold until a year anybody from a ship identified as carrier undocumented immigrants, violates the canadian charter of the rights and liberties.
The head of the quebecois bloc, gilles duceppe, has also said that they could not support the bill, because it takes on the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, then you will what the government will," said mr. duceppe.

The minister of immigration, jason kenney, has accused the opposition parties to play to politics and to ignore the willingness of canadians.
"Canadians say heavily to legislators that they do not tolerate such illegal migration, these operations criminal that target canada and who treat the country as a paillasson."
"They expect to what canada take measures farms," has responded the minister kenney.
The government did not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country 'advenant its rejection election.
A conservative, however, has told the qmi agency that the government would demand a vote for each mp that is then explained to oppose its voters.
The new unity does not unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unity to the fight against corruption and collusion by jean charest, many observers continue to ask the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The minister of public security, robert dutil, argues that this idea did not begin yesterday 's: quebec have consulted the department of investigation of new york to this issue in january.
The permanent metropolis has a unity on corruption since 1870.
Yet, the announcement of mardi has surprised more.
It should say that in a meeting of the permanent council on services policemen of quebec, last october 29), this has never been discussed despite the presence of robert dutil.
It took not more for the public criticism péquiste in terms of security, stéphane bergeron, calls this announcement on "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution bricolée on the corner of a" table.
The minister dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You see the result when you will announce it, will simply - - to say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the csq, réjean parents, nothing can to replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More mr. charest to obstine not to create this commission of inquiry, more people as you and i think that it has something to hide," he.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, it is the resignation of jean charest," about him yves boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the national school of public administration.
Out of this impasse, he suggests quebec to give a special mandate to vérificateur general so that he collusion inquiry and corruption.
"You must be able to expand the office of vérificateur general," edge he.
It also reckons that quebec could give the vérificateur the same powers that to a commissioner, enabling him of force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escouade is not the only on the shelf of government charest project.
Quebec require also ottawa change the criminal code in order to be better adapted to this kind of crime.
This demand émanerait the prosecutor of the operation hammer, which has informed the minister of justice jean - marc fournier that the law is not explicit in this kind of surveys.
The federal minister of public security, vic toews, has confirmed that his colleague of justice, rob nicholson, to turn présentement on some amendments linked to the file.
In the operation spring 2001, that ravaged the groups of motards, even if the criminal code was not appropriate, 131 people have been arrested.

450 million in bid contracts
Hydro - quebec gave $striving to achieve 450 million in contracts to firms of engineering for the hydroelectric project eastmain - 1 - - sarcelle - rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed firms bpr, dessau, a group sm and axor who has obtained the most important, one of the gérance project, to a sum of 295 millions of dollars without call of offers.
This consortium called gérance energy has been made in 2004 in order concomitante the choice of hydro - quebec of entrusting the private sector its responsibility to manage this important project hydroelectricity of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium energy gérance décrochait the lucrative contract without that there has been to call of offers public.
For the quebecois party, the use of consortia corporate poses a serious ethical problem that risk to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"It is the new way to make collusion and to bring down the competition."
"It is to say that people, instead of make it of open way, now the secret make way," said yesterday hamas mp péquiste sylvain simard in press conference.
Earlier in matinée, mr. simard has raised the issue to the national assembly because he says see difficult how the public interest can be used in this way.
The minister of natural resources, nathalie normandeau, has counters in afternoon, that there has been collusion denying loudly for this contract.
"I beginning to my journey," she pesté, arguing that the pq had been "dishonest" and "failed to rigor."
She said that "it would be the least" that the pq apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually of limited alliance in the time that helps two or several firms to pool their respective engineering in order to meet a call for offers for a project complex.
The project eastmain carries a high level of complexity, given the scale of work.
The agenda is underway and must échelonner until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the hands of competition acting; there has been negotiation.
As a result, the formula consortia is an exception québec, even for projects relatively simple.
As the revealed the last week the duty, the formula of consortia in the genius - sector council subject to a survey in government.
A rapid fly in the set of quebec firms helps dénombrer more than 200 consortia, whose some seem permanent.
Thus, the firm dessau works in partnership with most of its major competing, including cima +, génivar, snc - lavalin and other rock and tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens, exhibit at one person, or moral dessau.
For what is the consortium energy gérance, the minister normandeau has emphasized that "the territory of the bay james responds to specific dynamic of manpower and that hydro - quebec responds to way since the 1970 's special."
The great boss of the project eastmain, real laporte, society of energy of the bay james (sebj), has given an explanation has sourciller on the fact that the gérance of has been granted project to contract striving to achieve.
"On crutches in call of offers and that there is little to soumissionnaires, tes prices will be higher."
"You are two choice: either you take the people who are in the market and you say: we will negotiate an understanding and satisfying with a cheaply."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the jurisdiction of people," said mr. laporte.
This the consortium energy gérance contract is part of a long list of over $50,000 contracts achieved by the quebecois party.
The contracts were provided by hydro - quebec or the sebj for the eastmain project - 1 - - sarcelle - rupert.
After diligence, the duty has boasted 109 genius contracts - council agreed between 2002 and march 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soils laboratories.
Snc - lavalin has swept 22 contracts, génivar in got 16, tecsult 14, and dessau 10, through its participation in energy gérance.
All have been negotiated contracts.
They account 449 $783 344, including the contract to energy gérance 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain simard has hinted that the four firms that compose the consortium (bpr, dessau, a group sm and well - known axor) are "the liberal party of quebec."
The minister normandeau has dropped that the pq is also linked to these firms that the "finance," before to say that he was, rather than its leaders.
Barometer of consumption responsible - the label "green" does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The consumer quebecois done very little confidence actors to of sustainable development, but also to fair brands and the notifications écologisantes to guide its choice.
Worse, even if he media languishing in a world where the messages in favor of a more accountable consumption spreading, it was a credible lack of information, deficiency that he calls even brake on his commitment, indicates the barometer of consumption responsible, whose primary reading was fought yesterday.
Even if they raise consumption of products physical socially accountable in 2010, the quebecois seem but grant very little of those who try to their credit to sell.
Indeed, two - thirds of them say not believe environmental commitment of companies like advertising green companies, reveals the measure developed by the consumption watch responsible for the university sherbrooke.
Another realization: roughly half of consumers doubt the reliability of official notifications apposées on products called fair, but also of the credibility of products and the brands posting as écoresponsables, indicates the barometer.
In the same vein, the rhetoric of this theme politicians is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the quebecois.
The information on consumption responsible seems but crucial to energize this body of the current consumption animated by nearly one - third of consumers quebecois.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious character of the information calmeraient ardeurs 46% for consumers.
It is the second drag identified by the barometer, after the higher prices for these products.
Moreover, one - third of the quebecois is also say distrustful to the performance alléguées products and services greens that you seeks to their between the hands.
On another notes, consumers have been nearly half of them in 2010 have changed their habit and especially changed marks a or several products to respond to their conviction.
To the tune of 61%, they have also favored purchases of traders of their neighborhood, and educated privileged the purchase of foodstuffs in their region, describes the barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of consumption responsible has reached 64 on a maximum 100 to this year - homo consumus of quebec likes present himself as the king of recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint concern for the protection of animals.
But his social conscience and ecological seems to remain outside of cars, indicates a barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of the quebecois reported have used the transport in common or advocated the covoiturage to defend their own interests greens.
The march and the bicycle were also supported by behavioral 39,1% of participants to this vast survey, which has to take its first cliché.
A loan of the state to the purchase of excentris
The government of quebec, who asked to engage financially in the purchase of complex cinema excentris by angus society and the parallel, willingness to work, but only to competition from a loan.
Society of development angus and the parallel, who hoped contributed $seven million of the ministry of culture to buy to excentris cinematic daniel langlois the complex on the saint - laurent boulevard in he revived his full vocation cinéphilique, don 't get what they derived.
The government to accept involved in the file, but its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of quebec proposes a loan whose the amount would be less than the initial expectations, which might be a viable solution to terms, at least in the opinion of the sources outcomes of officines of the state.
A first plan of action, and a demand for 12,8 million quebec had already been jilted by the spring, but the requests have been revised downward.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to the st - minister peter by the president of the cultural society of business development (sodec), francois macerola, who pilot the issue of excentris.
He punched a achieve a ultimate report a decade ago of days.
But the counter - proposal cabinet has come to the sodec mardi.
The parallel and angus have until the 31 december to meet them.
But it seems that the assumption of donation of the state must really be ruled out.
Recall that the association of owners of cinémas and cinéparcs of quebec opposed to a direct investment in the state to endorse the purchase of excentris, arguing that the ministry of culture has not home to finance projects, what he did not done for other rooms movies.
But several actors middle derived instead substantial economic assistance.
Daniel langlois, the owner of céans, for ten years ago brought to end the cinema arm of author in its local from complex after financed himself its construction, which could justify an exemption of the council 's share of the treasury.
The lack of independent rooms to the movies is shouts to montreal, and excentris had su fidéliser its customers.
The angus society and the parallel, with their heads christian yaccarini, lead, their side, a campaign financing in private, hoping collect $700 $1,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of three screens, the parallel, continues to spread of the films excentris.
The aim of future homeowners is to reopen the three rooms on february 27 next in xavier projecting the very beautiful film beauvois of men and gods.
But christian yaccarini did not reminded the duty and one ignores what he and his group believe proposals to the fall of their are made.
The veil levied on a canada complexé.
The new american diplomatic cables wikileaks divulgués raise the veil on what the united states see as the inferiority complex of canadians for americans, but they trahissent at the same time the sense of superiority in recent towards canada.
Thus, american diplomats étonnent that each voter canadian did not canado - us relations in mind when ranging vote and believe that president obama has helped the conservative government 's visit to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the us embassy in ottawa and washington, public on the public square yesterday, offer more details croustillants than the content substantial to put under the a tooth.
A cable daté of 22 september 2008, or in full federal election campaign, recounting how the united states are not part of the stakes spurred by the political leaders.
The great astonishingly in the us ambassador in office to ottawa, david wilkins.
Mr. wilkins offers a few explanations to this situation.
"A canadian inferiority complex almost inherent determines may be the domestic political leaders canadians to talk about stakes in the newspaper rather than to shift this election on the united states (as during the campaign on free - trade of 1988)," he wrote.
The united states are thus, concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak."
The ambassador includes all the more this "deafening silence" that the two countries have intense political and economic relationship.
"Logical, he says, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more of a leader of party to manage this relationship essential should be a key factor that voters have in mind when ranging vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent the bed 22 january 2009 by terry breese charged business to ottawa, setting the president barack obama to her first visit to ottawa.
"Your trip help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence in early february on the federal budget, by which canada affichera his prime deficit in more than a decade, owing to a $30 - 40 billion stimulus package," wrote mr. breese.
Nowhere is that the government had to extend he mentioned the parliament before christmas to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the stimulus package proposed.
Another communication, it from january 2008 and signed wilkins, warned ambassador 's washington of the image of negative increasingly that dramatic spread to cbc sending series of the united states.
Ambassador worries border emissions, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and chilled h2o, where one sees little subtle references to maher arar, to the "no - fly - list" or to kidnapping to interrogations tough of the cia.
Another cable presents that, in their first meeting bilateral, hillary clinton has asked his french counterpart bernard kouchner if europe was prepared to embrace some guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. kouchner has responded yes, but on the basis of "case - by - case basis."
At the end of the meeting, is he writes, "he called a paper to the secretary of state about omar khadr, a muslim 15 years of origin canadian."
"The secretary agreed to revise the file."
Finally, argue that the minds are mounting concerning the wikileaks.
Tom flanagan, a former advisor very close stephen harper, said on the waves of cbc that the head of the mass exodus should be "murdered."
It is echoed to mike huckabee the united states.
A plan for the renewal the world lighting
The un has proposed yesterday in cancún a plan of renovation of the domestic lighting, trade and industrial in 100 countries in order for a reduction of greenhouse gases (gases that fits almost one - third of reducing additional that it must realize to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the process of great tangible that the un hopes adoption in cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduction in industrial countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, even if the incandescent light bulbs who monopolize of 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by light bulbs fluocompactes or, better, by light bulbs to diodes électroluminescentes (del or "led" in english), the bulk of 1.8 billion tons (gigatonnes) of greenhouse gases issued on the planet to light the human would be avoided.
The global lighting is responsible for 8% of emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global emissions the park automobile.
In copenhagen, last year, the biggest emitters, such as the united states, china, europe, and others, including canada, are committed in voluntary reduction programs that should put the global emissions of greenhouse gases 53 gigatonnes to 49 gigatonnes.
But it will take even remove of this assessment 5 gigatonnes to happen to stabilize by 2020 rising climate 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid he became out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of energy withers away in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, product of light.
With light bulbs fluocompactes, spending energy is reduced to 75%, and with the new light bulbs del, it reduced the need to energy of two again.
The light bulbs fluocompactes lasting by an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new light bulbs to del, such as those that launched the manufacturing philips this week - this society has participated in the study of the un -, have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume energy 80% less than a ampoule incandescente, which gives a idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new light bulbs can also work with rhéostats in more issue very little of heat.
And they contains no mercury.
Several specialists posted of reserves to the place to light bulbs fluocompactes because they contain mercury and that they need to be eliminate as waste dangerous, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturing enact prescriptions.
But, indicates the report, the main source of issuance of mercury on the planet is not the ampoule fluocompacte, but rather the coal - fired power plants, that issue many mercury in order to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
Only the united states - - these central 25,000 tons of mercury emits per year.
The report outlines the gains that would each country thanks to the international agenda.
For example, indonesia spared a billion dollars per year by purchases of electricity and eight million tons of co2, the equivalent of 3.5 fired plants whose construction cost 2.5 billion.

Case clotilde reiss: the elysée has hyped mediation of syria
For more than ten months, in july 2009 in may 2010, the fate of clotilde reiss, the french young researcher arrested in iran to "espionage," has held opinion in protracted france, diplomacy alert, and made the deterioration of the relationship between paris and tehran.
The attentive under the eyes of the diplomats of us.
The us documents obtained by wikileaks and consulted by the world reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the élysée palace has explained his strategy americans, up to their provide advice to the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in iran (a small group of randonneurs).
They show how french officials have sought to convince washington that the release of the french young had not been to return the award in freedom majid kakavand, an iranian detainee in france and wanted by the us justice for smuggling materials to the benefit of the iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place under a stark light how the french presidency has sought to manipulate the media to accréditer the idea that the syrian president bashar al - assad, had played a central role in the release of clotilde reiss.
In fact, there was nothing.
A diplomatic télégramme drafted the 12 august 2009 in paris is entitled "iran: french comments about how to manage the case of hostages."
The strategic adviser of the palace for business, françois richier, accompanied by the director of the quai of orsay for north africa and the middle east, patrice paoli, maintain with the us diplomat kathleen allegrone.
They explain the french method.
They tell americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals held in iran.
"Made of saber," they say, "martelez endlessly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "immediate innocence," "liberation."
It must in order to embarrass the iranian regime, sensitive to his image.
"Made - the more so given that the iranians you ask not to do."
Because, past attempts to discussion by channels discreet, "the silence is règlera nothing," the iranians are "masters exercises delaying."
Mr. richier adds that the arrest of foreign is "a tactic iranian familiar: the taking of hostages for the political blackmail."
He warned that the release from prison of clotilde reiss (which comes the august 16, when it hides to the embassy of france) "require the desirability the iranians of a large amount of money" (230 20,000 euros of bailout).
And there is know that the élysée palace anticipate other hostages crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
The iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1 800 french citizens living in iran," he said.
28 august 2009.
Clotilde reiss is release from prison since 12 days, but remains obstructed in iran.
A information is posted: iran majid kakavand, including the united states extract extradition to a traffic illegal electronic hardware sensitive to iran, has called into freedom in paris, on decision of a judge.
The american embassy, as many observers, addresses this troubling coincidence.
To washington, which search iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material to the nuclear program, enlargement of majid khakavand is bad news.
France has it accepted a bargaining?
The release of the iranian against the french?
In a new interview with kathleen allegrone, the 4 september, françois richier ensures that this is not the case.
The élysée palace, he says, not only "has been completely caught by surprise by the judge 's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There has been heated exchanges, among the french presidency and the guard of sceaux" (at that time, michele alliot - marie), but "the french government cannot go on the" judicial decision, he observed.
Mr. richier is also demonstrate that majid kakavand remains close brought under the "french" surveillance of intelligence.
The adviser of the palace comprises a phone number, raccroche, then amorphous the us diplomat that iran 's "is currently swaths in buildings in paris managed by iran' s embassy."
During the detention of clotilde reiss in iran, the élysée palace household not its efforts, the middle of transmitted and "leaks" in the media, to believe that the syrian president bashar al - assad plays an important role "" and "influential" of "mediator."
Americans see this activity ironically, and recognize that the manipulation bearing fruit as several articles of french official press effect version.
A télégramme daté 25 august 2009 describes "the blitz media of french officials."
What is based so many "gratitude" expressed towards mr. assad, wonders the embassy in paris.
"Despite their statements cocksure praise, french officials recognize in private that they have only a hazy notion of what the syrians have actually did."
Then the document to turn on the reasons that have pushed the élysée palace to pay in the fiction.
The intense effort communication "aims to validate sarkozy 's policy of openness to syria," he analysis.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been seen, by many votes criticism in france and abroad, as premature and imméritée."
In "exagérant the syrian role," paris seeks to "show syria what praise it can drawing in playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also "pave the seeds of contention between syria and iran."
The american embassy knows good source.
August 11th, françois richier him committed: "of course, we do not know whether the syrians have done anything."
"But we the remerciés when even."
"This should at least create the confusion among the iranians."
Clotilde reiss make in france may 16 2010.
Nicolas sarkozy the receives in the élysée palace.
In a statement, it thank the presidents of brazil, senegal, and syria, for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
No games in line for young koreans past midnight
The south korean government will adopt a law dubbed "cendrillon" who interdira to adolescents to play to the olympics online after midnight in blocking access, indicated by government officials.
A bill will be subject to parliament in december to ask societies of the online to block access to these games after midnight, young less than 16 years old, indicated representatives of culture and ministries the family.
"Many children play in these games all night and then difficulties in studying at school, and to have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that the law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleeping," said the afp olympic games rin, the responsible ministerial in charge of the bill.
The games online will be available to 6 again in the morning.
Societies will have a year to prepare for the law enforcement, he said.
The government envisages also to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games for young whose parents are demand, has added the responsible.
It will also put at the disposal of the people who the cry of software free which limit the time spent on the internet.

The country is also the champion unchallenged global athletics games online.
In november, south korea had won four gold medals in world cyber games, facing 58 other nations.
Global 2018 - 2022: the country fifa describes the organizers
In turmoil of suspicion of corruption, because the executive committee of the fifa nominates jeudi countries organizers of the world 's cuts 2018 and political 2022, a choice abundantly where scores of influence and lobbying may take the not on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the edition 2018 of competition fifa queen be held in europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: england, russia, spain, portugal, netherlands - belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the international federation hoping conquer of new territory (qatar, australia), after a first on the african continent in 2010, or pursue its entry the united states and in the far east (japan, south korea).
The list of figures part of the delegations (david cameron, the prince william, josé luis rodríguez zapatero, josé socrates, bill clinton, the amir of belgian qatar, the heads of government and dutch, zidane, beckham, cruyff) gives the extent of stakes of a global economic and political.
The political maneuvers in the wings thus likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of the fifa, the dossiers english, hispano portuguese - (2018) and american (2022) have best arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations are not very large for the 22 members of the executive committee to the hour of vote.
The sunday times, at the origin of revelations that led to the suspension for corruption two members of this (reynald temarii and amos adamu), could have undermined the chances of his country, cradle soccer that has greeted the world that only once, in 1966.
The bbc has called a loaf, monday, spreading a documentary influential that these three members of this, ricardo teixeira, nicolas leoz and issa hayatou.
What alienate fifa and put in the embarrassment officials english, which embarked on a intense lobbying in recent weeks with david cameron in first line.
The head of government hopes rééditer the coup managed by his predecessor tony blair, which had achieved in 2005 to london the organization of the olympic games - 2012.
This intense activity she says enough to regain the attractiveness of england from the this?
Nothing is less course because the duo portugal - spain is no shortage of assets with its stadiums already lending, its global (- 82 expertise in spain, olympic games - 92 barcelona, euro - 2004 to portugal), and its culture soccer.
But the dark financial and economic prospects of the two countries could doucher their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the english and doubts about the solvency of spain and portugal only increase the track of russia, become an outsider weight despite the gaps in its case (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the prime minister vladimir putin decided not to perform the shift in zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the run - vote," in a press itself alluded to veiled to charges of the english against the members of this.
"The covers mud, one tries to the compromising," has launched putin.
To 2022, the united states, thanks to the experience of 1994, are as the favorites rationales.
First power, global economic siege of major sponsors of fifa, the country seems to have a length ahead of japan and south korea, which have built separately a very beautiful project.
But these new members are premature for two countries with co - organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of global - 2026 to china, ardently called for fifa, that make in fact caduques asian chances for 2022.
With the qatar, which has pulled the great game by offering futurists stadiums, and australia, fifa concentrates its expansion into new lands, but these two countries are more risks that certainty.
Australia, like japan and korea, could also suffer the weakness of rights tv acquittés (owing hourly) by european countries, the gap the lifeblood of the war to fifa.
Second term: the obvious
De gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand believe that it was reluctant.
Valéry giscard d 'estaing and jacques chirac did not have any hesitation.
And nicolas sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate to the élysée palace in calls another.
Thus the current head of the state will be candidate in 2012.
But the obvious does not sit with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then he must do as if the doubt was always.
In a sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without think, the friends of jacques chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On november 15, with a air severe, nicolas sarkozy claimed that he would its decision "somewhere in the autumn of the year 2011."
That he talks to a parliamentary ump, mardi night in the élysée palace, the prospect of "two terms" has thus sparked a little fébrilité.
Was it official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far.
President was that reminder that the constitutional review of 2008 confined to two the number of quinquennats.
He was a realization, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he recalls the presidency, on the tone of humor, when such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you in for seven and a half years with me," their he launched in july 2009.
Rebelote in may 2010: "do not believe that i thoughtful not to the stage of after."
His remarks before - yesterday did not make it more candidate that the eve; they did not make it less.
If they have spread comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy at party, of a part.
But it is not the hat in ségolène royal that grows nicolas sarkozy to disclose.
It is on the contrary, because that his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many the party need a compulsory early in order to battle more than expected.
The bad polls, on the other.
For the first time the right - wing voters would prefer the application of françois fillon to nicholas sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to bva - the express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion to the ump here above," immediately and carefully responded 's prime minister.
"If he believes defeat possible, he will not be candidate," entrusts jean - pierre raffarin.
"It believe always win" power, corrects alain juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ecb forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The latest meeting of the governing council of the european central bank (ecb) of the year had to be the opportunity to specify the exit arrangements or, at least, announce the arrest of a lot of operations unconventional monetary policy that must be achèver at the end of the year.
Sovereign debt crisis of the european forces, the institute of frankfurt emissions will probably not afford to be too péremptoire under only made a more than tense situation worse now on the european bond markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, to the opportunity to a press conference, the french finance minister christine lagarde, thereby greeted the active role played by the ecb in favor of the resolution of the debt crisis states in europe.

Only certainty: the ecb will keep its main interest rate unchanged at historically 1%, its lowest level since may 2009.
In the facts, the treasury bond purchases by the ecb have doubled last week, at nearly 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretion of operators market, it would have made of irish new purchases of securities, and portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystème have bought for 67 billion euros since may 2010.
Among the operators, market expectations of a continuation of purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
The economists not do not expect change notable course.
If the operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the ecb 's arsenal, this last doing even to unlimited allocations of liquidity, according to generous and conditions for shorter to smear menstrual of a week to three months.
The economists expect today that this system is prolonged months.
"I cannot imagine that change significantly its program."
Otherwise, "it would be risk to cause of new tensions in the short term," estimated michael schubert, economist of the commerzbank.
"An exit progressive announced during the first quarter 2011 seems more likely," anticipates of his side economist norbert bräms among sal.
Oppenheim.
On the plan of its interventions in the market of public debt, "the ecb should maintain purchasing a volume of these bonds for animer a sluggish" market, adds norbert bräms.
Given the importance of exhibits european banks to the markets of sovereign debt of the euro zone, the institute of cap - and has no other choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must substitute for lack of investors at all costs on the market and act in a way to prevent a runaway yields paid by the most fragile states," was an important manager bond yesterday.
Because if interest rates are high, the states will be even more gênés to reduce their indebtedness, otherwise stabilizing.
The task of the euro is to this prize.

On one hand, it is a scandal apparent, a scandal that appears as scandal that, at the hypocrisy that govern relations among states, citizens and the press.
On the other, it announcement of profound change on the international level, and préfigure a future dominated by the retreat.
But doing by order.
The first aspect of wikileaks, it is the confirmation of the fact that every issue implied by a secret service (of some nation that this is) is made exclusively press outages.
The "extraordinary" revelations us on the habits of berlusconi only sexual yield what for months could be read in any journal (except those whose berlusconi is owner), and the profile sinistrement absurdum of khadafi was long to the artists of cabaret matters to this.
The rule in which the secret dossiers must be compounds that new already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go in a bookstore devoted to the esoteric publications, you see that every repeats (on the holy grail book the mystery of helm - the - castle, the templiers or the rose -) cross exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this not only because the author of research texts occultists does not like to novel (nor knows where search for new on the absent), but because those who are vouent to occultism believe that what they know already, and that vindication what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism to dan brown 's success.
Idem for the secret dossiers.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or minds limited) chief of secret services (or it could be, that i know -, editor of liberation), which does holds as true that what it recognizes.
The information oranges secret on berlusconi that the us embassy in rome sent the state department were the same as those that newsweek issued the week before.
So why revelations about of these cases have so noise?
On one hand, they say what anyone cultivated knows already, to know that the embassies, at least since the end of world war ii, and since the heads of states can call or take a plane to meet dinner, have lost their function and, except for some small exercises of diplomatic representation, are transformed into centers of espionage.
Any initiatives films of inquiry knows this, and it is only by hypocrisy that one fact semblance of ignore it.
But the fact that the repeat publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put under a bad light us diplomacy.
Second, the idea that a hacker any can capture the country 's secret secret more the world' s most powerful wears a coup not negligible the state department 's prestige.
As the scandal is not so much in the victims that the crisis "executioners."
But such - in the very nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of orwell, one could design power as a big brother who controlled every move of his subjects.
The orwellian prophesy had completely proven since, could control each movement thanks to telephone, every transaction made, visited hotel, the motorway learning and so on, the total citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrates, as it is now, that even the cryptes secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the report of control ceases to be unidirectionnel and becomes circular.
The power control each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as vengeur of citizen, can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the opportunity to maintain its own secret can hold?
True, georg simmel already put it, that a true secret is a secret vacuum (and secret vacuum can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all know about the character of berlusconi or merkel is indeed a secret vacuum of secrecy, because raising the public domain, but reveal, like the did wikileaks, that the secrets of hillary clinton were empty secret means him to remove all power.
Wikileaks has made no wrong to sarkozy or merkel, but has made a too big to clinton and obama.
What will be the consequences of this injuries inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the states can no longer online no information reserved - it would to publish on a poster collée around the corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies, it is fruitless hope to run reports confidential by telephone.
Nothing easier than discover if and when a head of state has shifted in airplane and has used one of his colleagues.
How can be nurtured in the future and private reports reserved?
I understand that, for now, my forecast is science - fiction and is romanesque, but i am forced to imagine government agents that move of uncontrollable quiet in diligences the itineraries way, by is carriers than messages learned by heart or, at most, in hiding the few written in the achilles of a shoe information.
The information will be conservées in single copy in closed tiroirs to key: at bottom, the attempt by watergate of espionage has been less successful than wikileaks.
I had the opportunity to say that the technology argues now in crabe, it is - - say to reverse.
A century after the telegraph wireless revolutionized communications, internet telephone has reestablished a telegraph on son ().
The vidéocassettes (analogiques) had allowed researchers in movie to explore a film not to, going forward and back in découvrant all the secrets of the digital makeup, while now the s () can only to skip of chapter in chapter, it is - - say, macroportions.
With the fast rail, you will of rome in milan in three hours, while in airplane, and travel that he includes, it must three hours and a half.
There is thus not extraordinary that politics and the techniques of communications go back to cars to horse.
A final observation.
Once, the press tried to understand what is going in the secrecy of embassies.
At present, the are embassies that the information to the press demand.
Climate: how france quick fix its promises of financing
A year after the copenhagen agreement, it is time to examine respect promises of financing early soon débloqués (known financing fast start or) made by developed countries.
And the big bidouillages french are revealed.
In the copenhagen agreement, developed countries are committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The european union has promised 7,2 billions of euros over three years and france 1.26 billions of euros (or 420 million per year).
During the opening of the cop16, the eu has pulled the great game to persuade its partners in the reality of its commitment concerning the financing fast start: report detailing action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of prospectuses...
The operation transparency is welcome and valued to its fair value: the developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do likewise with the same level of precision.
The eu announcement have released in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which is on the right way to respect its commitment to 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when we look in the details, things are more complicated.
This money should be, according to the copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," to ensure that an extra effort is achieved without being at the expense of the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional."
While the european commission had proposed harmonized, some member states whose france have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that fits him best.
For example, the european commission considered reference the year 2009: the international financing are kept, and it adds 150 million over three years to the title of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen credentials similar in terms of year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
By contrast, france estimates that the financing of "all the new projects" of the 2010 are "new and additional."
Other words, there has not of reference spending from preceding years or the overall level of official development assistance.
Actually, the total amount of france 's support for developing countries can remain stable (or even reduce), it claims to fulfill its commitment in financing "new and additional..."
Other crucially, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its way calculation.
Some, like france, see that €1 lent is tantamount to €1 given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some that are profitable investment projects (often linked to mitigating emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro as one will recover as equivalent to a euro that one gives. all the more, should be relied the title of its commitments that the cost of ready for the lender countries (the equivalent of a interest rates).
But france has that make such a reasoning: it "respects" his commitment from 420 million euros by 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36,1 million euros) - see the document of the eu to verify yourself.
It is the only country of the union to use if heavily the loan.
Germany is requires to 46%, while denmark, the netherlands, or slovakia (in other) their commitments with 100% of donations respect.
In other words, when the overwhelming majority of the european union €1 to meet its commitment, france does makes that ten cents and sees that effort is comparable.
Nice trick - going!
In short, in his fast start financing, france invents a double scam: a part on the evolution of action in the time and other part on the reality of the financial effort.
By not spending that 36,1 million euros, it comes to believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" focus on its promises.
The manipulation of the ministry of finance (because he seems although it is bercy who has made the arbitrage) could have a negative double impact, both within the eu (why the other member states would continue to give if it is enough to lend?), and in the negotiations since developing countries are not entirely fooled...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question, relative short term, relative to the whole of the climate talks.
But it could be a grain of sand more in the vast machine that is unfccc.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever in any case, he is indispensable to learn the lessons of his first year of early financing.
First, france might announce a change in the way to equalize for years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with other countries of the european union.
More importantly, france could advance the discussions on the stakes of long - term financing (another chapter crucial discussed currently): you not escape the question of the "additionalité" or how to equalize loans.
France could change its position to become also progressive on these stakes that it is on others.
So the hope rests on the new environment minister, mrs kosciusko - morizet, which runs in cancún next week.
An announcement surprise on the fast start of france and its vision of the "additionalité" and the use of international loans would nature increase the level of confidence necessary for progress in the talks.
Alert pesticides ingérés by children
A 10 years ingère child in a day 81 chemical substances different, according to a study published this wednesday of the association (ex - movement for the future generations rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistically significant value in low number of samples analyzed, but they are illustratifs of the problematic treated," has bought between july and september foods generally consumed in four meals, and a encas a day by a child of a dozen years, in the supermarkets of the oise and paris.
These types meals, including the official recommendations expense, three - five fruits and vegetables dairy products, and 1.5 liter water per day - - as well as of sweets, have been examined by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheets of the base is damning: 81 chemical substances whose 42 are divided cancer possible or likely and five substances divided cancer some as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocriniens trouble (pe), according to studies of several institutions such as international center for cancer research.
"Even if, in almost all of legal cases, the limits to each individual substance chemical taken are not exceeded, one sees well in our survey that the reality of the exposure of consumers in contaminants possibly cancer and / or concerns pe," note the association.
For the small lunch, the cake and the tea the milk contain alone more than a dozen biofuels cancer possible and three proven as cancer some as well as nearly 20 biofuels likely to disrupt the hormone system.
Brazil 's apple, imported, predicted by the survey, as encas present traces of six chemical substances whose a fungicide yet banned in france.
The same is true for kenya 's beans greens, included in the lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the eu.
Moreover, the steak haché, tuna in, and even the box "of bread and the chewing gum were truffés of pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water result of the spigot analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforme.
For the dinner, the steak of salmon was the most "rich" with 34 residues chemical detected, and even the review of the plastic base used for warm meals in the micro - scare in was not devoid.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cocktail parties of contaminants," "is likely underestimated," according to the study.
The alliance europe ecologie - the greens (ee - lv), meanwhile, has proposed "to confront the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the rise of diseases of civilization."
In july, a study of the european agency for food security (efsa) was state of the presence of residues 365 pesticides different identified in the fruits and vegetables consumed in europe, whose 76 the grain.
