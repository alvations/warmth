The lack of snow in the mountains of concern to the hotel
Not only the peacekeepers of Telesquíes in Krkonoše are concerned the lines without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše can still be free rooms for all winter, including dates for Christmas Eve and partying.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The people look offers, checked the prices, but still fear of reserve with commitment.
And if we call, immediately on our opinion, ask if these Christmas snow or mud, "mentioned the groves of Spindl.info Martin Jandura information portal.
Those who want to move in Špindlerův Mlýn a partying according to their expectations, should not hesitate in reserving the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindlerův Mlýn offered on all weekly stays for partying.
I believe that will continue, but soon relent and provide shorter stays.
And then the rooms free be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer beds free for all dates of winter.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
The half of the places offered free.
So we have already prepared some stays Christmas, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency in Vrchlabí can also offer the partying in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
Are sold very well the first fourteen days of February, the remaining regular winter dates are sold.
This year the interest in the winter is impeded by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to go to the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the runways are snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas is exhausted, "also believes Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to hold the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately a five per cent better.
For Christmas Eve and Christmas, we have the last places free.
The Polish interest increases during the holidays in January and February was also sold well, "reported the Director the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
The eighty per cent of the stays of partying are already engaged also in the Omnia Hotel, near the parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, the most recent of Janské hotel Lázně in Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are approximately sixty per cent of the capacity.
February has been a little more weak, but falling snow, the interest for stays in Krkonoše increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia Hotel.
However, at the moment, it seems that the hotel of Krkonoše will the appetite for snow waiting.
On Thursday should fall temperatures and, if rainfall, should snow in the mountains.
But then again higher temperatures, reported Jiří Jakubský Hradec Králové, Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
US: repetition is the mother of wisdom
Is comical that Barack Obama, the President, with the reputation of more intelligent man, as a diligent student recurs in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he took for the stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago.
Not only in the same text uses the phrase “ as in Iraq several times ", but we will not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement:" a new way forward ".
Three years ago was himself, who criticized Bush's idea to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today are nothing of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation has not improved, however objectively left his successor a initial situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expected to repeat the miracle.
The captains of field again ask to increase the military contingent, especially the Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley Mccristal. subordinate him, even though traditional relations, submitted to the rifles undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
Requested 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The President did not hesitate for three months, but it was nothing better, so that the less deceived general about 10,000 soldiers.
Obtained which Europe promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most troublesome of the whole strategy of Obama seems, begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finalizing this procedure in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama generated more questions than answers offered.
Many doubt that the increase give the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organized, their leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement was not satisfied.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally laid, but still only a people of Potemkin. after him remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the confusing, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Or even establish a State that is capable of action, "a minimum target for the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy comes by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic, who know nothing of the soul can actually believe that the military sent to war to soon return home, "will do some miracle here.
From the political point of view, set the date of the withdrawal of troops is irresponsible, as the Taliban will indirectly as a statement of the defeat us.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
Europe's politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to your constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy with war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions increased had no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
Will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America starts triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each well mean a dramatic reversal to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to go before the presidential elections and that there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.

The secret of splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did evidence of a missile
On Norway noted a brighter special effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence ended up recognizing yesterday that near the borders with Norway was evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, "Bulava, previously destined for the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Putin Vladimír.
Even its repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, was not flying or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers write of "Bulavá ” and “ a missile that not flies".
A missile that not flying, but shone.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem.
At the end of the flight of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, floating in the White Sea.
This type of possible missile launch from a vessel that is moving and black at once.
It is therefore likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, in reality outside the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegians alike since the first time did not hesitate in question of a Russian missile.
The generals are saying that this time cannot be simply to speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile years--a and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were Averiaron immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without mistakes, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost a fifty per cent full of optimism for the general and therefore are still claiming that "Bulavá" one day fly without problems and that even will take up to ten blocks Hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight maximum is 1.15 tonnes.

The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely by the frequent extra work, unions said on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the Automoviles Hyundai factory.

An effective discovery Czech: a substance until in Encallecidos' HIV virus
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans evidence of new compounds capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance improved is the fact that it is also effective against the virus resistant to medicines.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs accessible.
The disease AIDS can be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients may be extended significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus were not removed completely, will create the so-called resistant viruses; against them, no longer operate the medicines.
The work of the experts of the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg shows dominate the resistance of the virus.
Showed that substances known as Metalocarboranos have effect in the albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV.
The Metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all drugs used today, and therefore cannot solve the problem of resistance.
In its work scientists find new, ‘ improved ’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albumin of the virus.
The Metalocarboranos have a three-dimensional structure: two cages Poliedros composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resilient virus
The Proteasis HIV is an albumin of HIV virus, and is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the Proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of HIV virus would mature and infectious Corpúsculos of the virus.
If we stop the Proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explained in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see the table) are united by a short series organic, which remains amended systematically.
A little weak, but more effective
The effect of this series of test substances against the Proteasis HIV was conducted in tube, and also against their variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of Metalocarboranos in common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the medicines used clinically, however do not lose their effect in the resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical, changes to the Metalocarboranos are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová structural, the head of the Laboratory of Biology in the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of the Genetica in the Academía of sciences.
Heat for budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for the next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the Prime Minister as sentences.
Say that leaves time for analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of Cabinet bureaucratic with the support of Čssd, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to the Prime Minister Nečas must decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if you want to stay in her post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and Democración social towards the issue of public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals proposed by the left, by more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of government officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of ODS, as Cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and the desire of the Government, that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feelings of worthlessness; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals Modificadoras, the situation would have been different.
According to česká Televize Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
Noted that, is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas the nominated by the government have nothing to do Čssd, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister also should say clearly, if resign, the House adopted other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the Act on the service.
Topolánek: the Ministers nominated by the ODS are not fault
Is the issue of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed Topolánek in the news of the USA
Recalled that in several ministries in the seats of deputies there are people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that Fischer decides to reconcile the principle of the fight with the deficit in the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which rests on the most leftist, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies.
However they can count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters at the Chamber of Deputies Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by members of ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer for the afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS gave at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed, to ODS on Wednesday in the House of Representatives is likely to vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly calls upon the members of ODS to enable the acceptance of the budget.
We are not as orphans, are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned by the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I did not realise that my vote inaccuracies.
To leave the mandate knew that, in the following months they were on all of Bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive, reacted Topolánek.

I met many times in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as has been said - its energy, said in an interview after the premiere holiday in Los Angeles.
I think it is good, if the film we can recall the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, Perose refers to the entire world, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the British writer John Carlin's book entitled freely translated into the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this nation was born. portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two separate groups, racially and for long years. protagonist like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also the national dress of the South African team of rugby and gets to play. RSA won at the time the World Cup.
To enter the Gramilla in the clothes, that RSA is seen as almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great cheers, especially public White and the recognition of white people.
The football tournament will perhaps help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only “ black ” in the national team in 1995.
Still will be if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans are, however sceptical, as for example in an interview for ln an amateur rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.

Jančura submitted a complaint for slander to three Hetmánes of Čssd
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today presented a complaint for slander to three Hetmánes Socialdemocráticos.
It is Michal Hašek in the region Jihomoravský Kijówcki Ratko Martínek of Pardubický Kijówcki and Hetmán of Olomoucký Kijówcki Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned this in 20 minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, to maintain the regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended signing long-term contracts to the české Dráhy.
All three Hetmánes are attacking us and talk about the fact that we are “ taking the raisins of cake ", however brought only the supply for what they wanted.
Claim, which are more expensive than české Dráhy, which is not true. know the price of české Dráhy, which were set last week.
So there is something else to defend ourselves.
Is the slur on the Society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
Mentioned once have the evidence of all the regions. According to him have not taken necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint by the continuation of the show Medial of Mr Jančura, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am naturally prepared to defend my good reputation and my region and appeal to other Hetmánes do also.
Suppose, that also clearly demonstrate, on this occasion Mr Jančura manipulated the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
To Radiožurnál said, that Interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
Stated, that the campaign will be undertaken against the Corupción as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions agreed with české Dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the allocation of approximately SEK 150 billion not convened a build.
According Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of Čssd, because of its criticism of transport railways in the regions.
The only threat was that if we leave, we can lose the licences of buses.
Is presented as a member of Čssd, know, what it is, I am not going to say its name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine Neumococal will be free and voluntary
The vaccine Neumococal from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, are mandatory opinions, that a vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcal culminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum price of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January will receive a free vaccine Neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
The who began with the vaccine last year or before, they have to cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age of the child.
Last year the fourth part of the families left voluntarily to immunize their children against pneumococcus.
The parents however paid for a dose 1600 SEK and more.
Smaller to vaccinate children four doses are needed.
Experts estimate that insurance companies usually spent on vaccines from 300 to 450 000 SEK annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent across the vaccination of children about 500 thousand annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so-called package of Janota.
The pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of the serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of Neumococales infections in our country each year according to the investigations in hospitals 28 children die not older than the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech covered Neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine be compulsory?
However at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be mandatory in future.
From January should be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The vaccine would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their partnership spreads the vaccines Neumococales since long ago.
The experts in an international conference, in which our Association participated, were not completely Satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntary.
Is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least that.
I believe that this is the road that we now have to take, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health but not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcus.
At the moment I do not think at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors claim
The President of the Society of paediatricians Odborná Společnost Praktických Dětských Lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognises, that voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they will think about the reduction of the number of doses. "in the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, relatively understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as voluntary," said Cabrnochová.
The experts hope that from next year, more than 80 percent of the young parents leaves inoculated against pneumococcal their babies.
The vaccine Neumococal is a great change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save in the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
However the paediatricians are concerned for the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members however were afraid, that the insurance companies could "take the money of health insurance".
The doctors will have to buy vaccines and therefore expect, to be paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the paediatricians invested in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, said Cabrnochová.
Yet and US
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have been asked to ban the construction of minarets and that there is a general warning on the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report on the possible integration of Muslims and studied (which in reality are integrating) in one of the continent's most openly secular societies.
Some readers will this new book as admirers of author's last work “ what the French do not like veils ” (“ why the French don't like Headcarves ” (2006), a detailed study elegant and argued a problem which divided and the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As anthropologist, wants to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
Has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes now provide the 5-6 million Muslims of France that Mr Bowen called “ Islamic ” spaces.
He is a good listening that reproduces debates among teachers and students on the questions that concern them more.
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or a municipality (or both)?
Should teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
Are these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, which concerned the media more than political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and scholarly Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is at the same time to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
Fail to disseminate this argument.
The Conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts in Salalfi, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Question to what extent the policymakers French (and the intellectual elite that fiercely defends the secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims have probably more unjust treatment that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments with the secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived “ an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? after reading this book, one tends to say “ Yes, but not yet. "
The most devastating of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice which defines is melting at an alarming rate, taking the life that cannot survive in any other way.
The interests of the oil, gas, transport and fisheries have focused on water recently open, with diplomats, lawyers and now, as a result of this.
In “ on thin ice "(on thin ice") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of face value to bear white.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson as a courageous cadets in 14 years, fighting only by the end of its Jerez, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, while swimming following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the twentieth century, screened to 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, places of zoos are still generally a millionth part of the scope of an adult wild area. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green by the algae that grow within the areas without mincing its hues.

Ellis used stories of other writers and historians, and often makes the threat that the hunters to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the USA and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Eskimos in Motonieves used high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is the waters to the north of those two nations Cazadoras where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, “ after the ice "(after the ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling on the Arctic science and a daunting look how can transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists and oceanographers can adequately explained the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century gave evidence for the first time about the displacement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the Cold War drew a map of the Movedizos belts of ice below the masses of ice.
The exploration by satellite and the extensive series of probes fitted into the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped in the cold still performing many tasks.
The tiny world of Mr. Anderson looks into a special system tributary within the Arctic ice, formed by Chorritos of saline water compresses while freezes.
But since the bear in the microscopic surface to the wonders of the Interior, are doomed once the summer ice withdraw, what believes can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.

Marines among the six that placed wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. 'Angello Robinson, 19, went seven hours by bus to place a wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like someone to do the same for me, therefore only treatment to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met Saturday morning for placing wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
In 1992, SEK Morrill Worcester, the owner of the company Worcester in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen stop make the journey each year in different cities along the way, to perform events devoted to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths event across America, which has spread to other States.
This year the volunteers planted more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves in the cemetery in Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery national Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and carry the SEK.
Charleen hunt, 70 years, of Westminster, said that made the trip to Arlington in honour of her late husband, a career soldier.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to give a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, said.
Is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the fields and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of the First World War, the Second World War and the Vietnam war, because they are not as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful while children were playing and the couples taken from the hand, while carrying the fresh pine to the stones Sepulcrales.
Each Crown circular was a green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association of soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
The people wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others are inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the clay wet, for those whose headstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra B.B. Lockwood was one of the many mothers who are Enjugaban tears in their eyes before the tomb of her son.
Handled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Artillero of marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"long after my death I want someone can remember."
Cuban officers arrested a contractor of the US Government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government distributing mobile and portable computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the State Department.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, working for Development Alternatives Inc, with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular officials together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered “ dangerousness ”.
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critics, involve the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti government and speeches are considered serious offences.
Cuba is an emerging community blogger, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The detention of an American contractor can provoke tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a rapprochement "slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to learn of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and to create more space for the opposition, will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
The mobile and laptop computers are legal in Cuba, although new products and coveted in a country where the average salary of a worker of the government is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; are used mainly for text messages, a telephone conversation of 15 minutes cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
Is available in expensive hotels and hotel for foreign visitors, and establishment of the government, such as universities.
The Cubans want to connect, they often have to give their names to the government.
The access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Glory Berbena, press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
A activity in any other open society would be legal, such as delivering mobile free, is a crime in Cuba, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program for Human Rights Watch, which recently published a report on the so-called "new freedoms in Cuba, Castro, Cuba ”, a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
Stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often leads to a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials Desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, expressing hope that the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, which moves the Internet in search of young radicalized.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious figure insurgent, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them comments made approving terrorist attacks in the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah addressed the men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a family for al Qaeda terrorist and their training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince Al Qaeda commanders of that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, the isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They are considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not silent and even were trying to get the proper approval of access to fields of al Qaeda, when Pakistani police authorities arrested.
The case of five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, emphasizes the critical role of the recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most important, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has as main priority try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization acting as guards, not passing those that fail to demonstrate a serious commitment of the holy war, and those who might be spies.
The analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to the American would-be recruits.
But for the organization represented a huge appeal, because of their potential to have access to American and targets due to its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the Nefa Foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies are experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate to someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
Has been transformed into a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, require "action" climate
On Saturday tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here for the streets demanding the negotiators working on the Convention Centre beautiful center of the city, bolder actions to the climate.
The demonstrators said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the centre of the city.
In a day in which just happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists walked through the city in English holding banners that said "there is a planet B ” and a Spanish, which stated," The Land says' enough is enough '.
Several famous joined the protest, even the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru's home country, his mother, distressing made me aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate change are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the mass demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, said.
This is not an easy task, but has to be done, there is no way of avoiding more time.
The police prevented the demonstrators from approaching the beautiful Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or paperback for carrying knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified by being involved in the climate talks, some activists with masks and black dress placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
Were the buildings, he said, adding that began as flaring, but which were followed by "a couple of explosions great."
Within the Convention Centre, the people gathered around television screens to look the way throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not penetrate the awareness of key officials as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on the climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact on the international discussion, replied in English, “ was not really aware of the situation ".
Then followed saying in Mandarin, "as the venue is large, cannot hear what is happening outside."
Noted that depended on the perspective of each define if progress was being detrimental or beneficial.
Said that shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The record ratings last week on the federal performance in mathematics, was a very good news for the schools in the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the best performing systems with the country, the card showed that students in fourth and eighth grade strides at a more rapid pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is engraved in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap in performance between students African-American and white students, both local and national level.
The average scores of white students in fourth grade of D.C. during the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers African Americans rose three points, only 209 to 212.
In fact the difference of performance grew between 2007 and 2009, 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans from the eighth grade remained essentially fixed falling a point negligible statistically, 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference that separated to black and white students in fourth grade in 2003, when it issued the first Enpe in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58.
Some education in the District lawyers expressed concern last week, since progress by the Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven in large part by white students, which are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole to those at the top of the scale, what is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates for educational equity in the district.
Am not taking leaps of joy by two or three points, said the D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-por accumulation), who had a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that the secondary schools in the city have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly always want to see positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not the time nor the energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to find better ways to address the needs of the students.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, targeting students in the higher grades of primary and lower secondary school, which dominated the early foundations of reading in their school and are significantly behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real-life experiences, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, is something credited the progress reported by the Enpe last week.
Just think that we need to continue working to provide the best interventions to those students who are below the level of degree, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of the Enpe highlight the issue of whether Rhee can further increase the overall performance of the system and thus provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of Rocky dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, scores of evidence urban.
The solution of the conventional policy is to allocate its resources and reforms to schools located in the poorer sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate impact policies that go against that timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other superintendents urban, she is clinging to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We must strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access to public education excellent.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to the difference in performance is the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
Need to reach nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, which reached an agreement with the union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which considers as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next Convention.
To make higher education a more future
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong exhausted.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a moment before the white columns, the facades of brick and meadows Emerald.
The parents of Graciela barely had graduated at a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and other pupils of eighth grade of group explored Gettysburg, where enrolment costing 38.690 dollars a year, he was less of guests impressed that the potential of enthusiastic students.
I see here is where I am! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that had entered the building of science.
Goodness, serious, said Pensativamente, when the guide spoke of the low proportion Profesor-estudiantes school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited during his three-day trip, and had already absorbed completely his deliberate message: the question is not whether you go to university.
The question is what.
Although there is growing concern at the large number of children born in the United States of immigrant Hispanics dropping out of secondary school or became pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands that access to university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanic “ second generation ” graduates at the University, a remarkable achievement given that many of their parents, especially Mexican and Central American immigrants, entered the United States without the end of secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the labour force of the country.
Who discussed the most performance say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to have success.
Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes can also play a role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to come to the University, in particular if the efforts are sustained over time.
Noting to low-income children, whose parents did not have the experience and skills to help them navigate through the system, it follows that any intervention will not deal at any time, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think to provide a network of support for these children, from kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program which funded the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to implement the programmes of preparation, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until the end of secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60% visiting the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government had attracted major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions which ended on Saturday.
The 10 that the Iraqi Ministry of Oil reached agreements with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies exiting having Pujado in only two of the 10 deposits auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants at the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American, Asian and European companies to the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of online news.
Will be a long time before that something more is on offer in Iraq.
The security concerns, marked by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, the American military and political instability are withdrawn, probably prevented the American oil companies risk more strongly in Iraq, which has the world's third most important oil reserves, said the analysts.
The Americans were in some cases companies at a disadvantage, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, with labor costs significantly lower and more prone to take risks because they are accountable to the shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice in recent years, departed with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, spores in more contracts than any other company and large investments in contracts for two main deposits.
Know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad said.
We have every confidence that the Chinese company will couple of their competitors and will honour its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers then obeying-meeting subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production for the current levels in each field.
The main planner of al Qaeda has been killed in Pakistan, apparently,
It is believed that a US missile strike in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a principal planner of Al Qaeda operations this week, said Friday the US counter-terrorism officials.
To be confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh Al-somalí was one of two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles struck his car, near the town of Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American and Pakistani officials sources in the region.
The local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's tribal area is illegal.
Were driving a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from look Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected was rushed to the scene and quickly seized what was left of the "bodies completely torn."
The local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two American counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali were described as a military planner of al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Was devoted to conspire in worldwide, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guide of the senior command of Al Qaeda and resulted in operational standards for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
May not be a household name for some Americans, but this in no way diminishes the threat to us us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and another three high-ranking officers.
The pace of attacks by pilotless aircraft guided by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to an account of the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non-profit organization.
Maybe the decrease is due to an improved tactics by terrorist groups, that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability as suspected murder ruthlessly to the site, said.
The top UN envoy in Kabul to give
The United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide happening when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months leading to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants, to cooperate with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, said.
Eide said that was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
Said that wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, had a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
The officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a citizen Sueco-italiano that recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested to his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "certainly undermined the mission, because there were already much scepticism regarding the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the conducted by United States forces in Afghanistan.
Also the leadership of the UN to allow his successor hired more staff in the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the restrictions on their powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
So it is that the rules of the UN enabled me to recruit only a person since May, said.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran face additional sanctions
The defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that world powers will soon "significant additional sanctions against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of approximately 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a trip a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he minimized the importance of the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, held, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of that event.
One of the things I regret is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of targeted sanctions on Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
Argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really less safe with nuclear arms", because "their people suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences “ credible ” if its nuclear programme is not fully respecting the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that it would revert to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would make a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium, desperately needed in exchange for fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for this agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, experts claim, because the Iranian leadership is divided with regard to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a manner in which they have not been significant in terms of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
The President Obama has given Iran a deadline of 31 December to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, including continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations Thursday denounced what he called the "unfounded and baseless accusations of “, on the part of some members of the Security Council about the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers," in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, was found in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and officials Kurds in Irbil.
Tensions are high between the Kurds and Arab majority in Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in projects in the United States, to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 towards the end of August.
Gates also sought to assuage the anxiety Kurdish on the outstanding reduction. US officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the regional government of 82-83: "preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon you. "
In a China that ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by posters of propaganda that Sermoneaban on the fact that “ the Mother Earth is too tired to support children ” and “ a baby means a grave more. "
Learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of their city, change course suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, the reaction was instant and firm: in any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with a child of eight months.
More than 30 years after that one child policy being introduced in China, creating two generations of children notoriously Rechonchos, children only spoiled, warmly Apodados' little emperors', a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with the six when the policy was effective, as the Division
Demographic of the UN, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 and above exploit the 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the global average of approximately 20%.
The imbalance is worse rich with very educated populations in coastal cities, as Shanghai.
Last year, the people of 60 years and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and Shanghai municipal population, has said that the fertile couples have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," said.
A gradual relief
Written in the Constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
The couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
The Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure over their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples have abortions depending on the sex of the foetus, leading to a high Innatural proportion Varón-mujer.
In recent years, officials demographic have gradually softening its position on the one child policy.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are children only, and in 2007 damaged many of their hard line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University in Beijing, said that the central government officials have been discussing recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, China Shanghai became the first city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, posters ordering to the families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be good to have a second child and apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their houses and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also pledged to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
The family planning officials say that the response has been overwhelming.
Disappointing answer
Although the officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that observed a moderate increase in the requests for couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign, more urban districts no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is expected that the number of births in the town in 2010 only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to her first child, said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said he would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, had only medical and life insurance that provides them with the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, this option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly the policy of only son as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant, the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
Is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: "Eramos the centre of our families and were used to all charges of us.
We are not used to care for others and not really want care. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained in a more forceful manner.
For parents with two careers, middle class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew watching their parents struggle during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves, said.
Even a single child requires long of parents, argued.
A mother has to give at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "have to reshape its apartment, and the strategic" must have a curriculum ready for improved childcare when the child is 9 months. "
The majority of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
This is the first generation with the highest standard of living, said.
Do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, marked so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, captured a renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document which provides ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and pointed the way forward.
But was seen as a major step in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text would not talk about how much money the rich to poor countries to deal with global warming to short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies limit its coal production, and what would be the limit the global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the document of six pages, summarized a negotiating text for 180 pages to concentrate on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great picture."
Shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations collectively limit their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries limit the emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
In any case, the Friday the same kind of fireworks verbal that have dominated the talks last week.
America's special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims requesting compulsory cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary on the part of the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the major developing countries move forward and take measures, said Stern, who also regretted that the text had not done enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, stated that the maximum negotiating climate of United States lacked “ common sense, "or was" very irresponsible "for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic history of the world's major powers in the game, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies to save the planet, with China and the United States face on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the 24 most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative for action take more courageous.
Ricardo Ulate, a Delegate of Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to restrain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that talks will join a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a preliminary draft Treaty of 24 pages early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-metzger, is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the momentum for the small island nations "political pressure on the political process," in part because they are now consolidated and require action from the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency while delegates were focused on the fact that should resolve most of the outstanding issues before the Heads of Government will reach to close a deal.
The high-level officials, including the Minister of Environment Indian Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, fell from the aircraft and ran into the corridors of beautiful Center, closed meetings and press conferences, in order to delimit the claims to be provided during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people entering and leaving the convention centre, the activists concerning the guitar performances night to flout the countries which they are selling, and are preliminary proposals of hands instead of mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity just built: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering in the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 Kmh of Great Britain redefines the sense of Monday
To 5.13 on Monday morning, a Silbido Perforará darkness to point out a train which marks a revolution for Great Britain.
The country's first high-speed inter-city train will reach 225 Kmh, when as a beacon from Ashford, Kent, the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the secretary of transportation, is joining the Lady Kelly Holmes, to board the first inter-city service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service connecting finally Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connecting the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the times of business travel be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to the railways would reduce national emissions of coal, as well as relieve the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the battle of planning and inevitable fears about environmental damage, can restrain the high-speed lines still of Great Britain.
High Speed Two (Hs2), a company established in January in order to provide the government a feasibility study, submit its report to Lord Adonis 30 according to the times.
This will provide a detailed itinerary of the next phase planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in the urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the Plan chart within a radius of 25 metres of a final.
Hs2 is also expected to establish three options for a high-speed network wider approach to the North.
Lord Adonis respond in spring.
The favoured option is being proposed is a configuration with, and in which a single line of high-speed reach West Midlands.
The line will be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
“ It seems that this option would be more beneficial, "said a member of the railways.
Once completed, the journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which is not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the current little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 Kmh, making the British network in Europe more quickly.
The initial is designed to withstand trains 400 Mt of length, capable of delivering 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of Londres-birmingham.
This means that the London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the constraints of space in the capital, is expected to extend an existing station to conform to the high-speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International station or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis announced if it believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is implemented, the network would have to build in sections.
The principle would make the trains to stop the rapid the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is viewed as a crucial point necessary to ensure a change of planes trains, a reference point for the revolution.
The taxpayers are facing the mortgage by £Naranjal 75,000 of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Naranjal built in the home of their electoral district.
The prison spokesman of the party, which was degraded by David Cameron to complain that members living “ of rations ” increased its mortgage in £75,000 to build an extension within oak in his second home in Rutland.
Supplementary allowed him to burden the taxpayer interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who leads a review of members' expenses. Mr. Duncan said last night that the “ could not be more clear or simple requests. "
The Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space.
The last year added a greenhouse to the home, described as a "Naranjal levels".
The neighbors described it as “ a greenhouse for entertainment ".
He was not asked Mr Duncan that make no reference to the increase of the loan during a recent investigation by the committee on standards and privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the Committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of their expenditures.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds of its London property to his constituency home, which he bought in 1991, the previous year to become a member.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was asking about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications surged to more than £800 per month.
The interest rate on the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland of Mr. Duncan not changed in that time, suggesting that the increase would fund a loan of £75,000.

And could apply much more, but I am not. "
The Member, a millionaire by their former profession as oil trader, was questioned in the first place on their expenses in May, when it became clear that had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before agree with the office of wages that this “ could be considered excessive ”.
An activist dug a hole with the symbol of the pound sterling in the grass of Mr. Duncan in protest, after proving that requested £4,000 over three years.
Night, when asked about the increase of the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: “ was for improvements, adopted by both the Office of wages and subsequently by Legg. "
Added: “ It is not to escape and commit or Infrinjir the rules or whatever.
This is completely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
Could not in any way be clearer or more simple. "

Delay in payments: anger among the prison guards, envisaged actions
The prison guards unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization ” for demanding payment before the end of year holidays, the materials and the overtime, which was postponed until Eneropor budgetary reasons.

The direction of the prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.

Asked the direction of the prison administration immediately implement a series of measures designed to this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of hours of overtime not reoccur in the future.
The pay of December will then be low, except for the staff of the Directorate that enjoys the benefit of the famous materials by functions and objectives, and that always blames the "budgetary requirements, deplored the Ufap / Unsa.

According to the trade unions, not in all regions is the same, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not expected, said the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François forget.

The Association UDF closed the tone and the new centre on the use of its acronym
The UDF Association (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the modem () Democratic Movement of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (supply) on the symbol of the former party Giscardista, Intimándole to withdraw all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced their intention to regain the acronym UDF, because it considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend its political heritage after he reached out to the left.
On the other hand, the defence minister, whose party is linked to the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of NC.
In support of its management, was assisted by Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current) who claims ownership of the mark UDF, it was the first registered in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the Association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not wish to be deprived of it broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and to the Member Intimándolos to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the trademark, under penalty of suit.
These last few days, you have made many statements suggesting that went to propose to his political movement recover the acronym UDF writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of modem, as well as the Senator Jean Athuis of the centrist alliance.
Also feel is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the slogan + + Nouveau Centre +, and L UDF d aujourd'hui + in their militant material and the home page of its website, argue the signatories of the Charter.
As we know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF Office which requires the "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF support, as well as of (their) Internet site".
Also requests Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) marks to the legitimate copyright".
To do so, to use the court to uphold the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warning the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF 'is a real political movement since 1978 "and remember that Morin and his friends" chose "leave" to create a new party in 2007, as had already been done in 2002 to establish the UMP ".
Therefore, the new centre, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests of movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
In regard to Hervé de Charette, the Office continues, “ when registered the trademark ", it was no longer a member of the UDF since three years ago" but the UMP.
Advantage of scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do on their own.
This indiscretion is transformed into crime, reported, before mockery of the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy made his name to try out of anonymity fraudulently taking a name that is not right. ”

Any other person may appear in their place, "the representative of the public prosecutor, said Marie-chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that a once the trial is completed on the admissibility of the Bettencourt-meyers.

To put the client in the heart of the company, the revolution of marketing gave to the strategies of the conquest of markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the factors of preference for clients it happens regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end a demoralised deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly executives.
This demobilization serious committed the intellectual development of all functions of the company, on all of the R & D and, even more, of the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) requires that all the parties involved (...) a proactive conduct and a forward-looking view "; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, convened a managerial revolution, which would be the partners in the centre of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
The domestic opinion polls have relative utility
Do domestic opinion polls, as the questionnaire by Orange among their employees, to incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, fear not.
- principle, because I could verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all the companies end up making essentially... what always! B989
- Secondly, because the pathologies of power, authoritarianism, a growing proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- Finally, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
As from large schools of engineers, interpret the psychology mechanistically.
Adopted, for convenience, the former behavioral theory that the "intellectual Neurosciences" reactivated recently, and American research institutes and the media were widely disseminated to their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commandos" (sic) the commitment of the executive, a recent investigation by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms to the managers in a position of management mechanistic, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, is taking a finalist vision of human behaviour.
Consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a basic fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly as a means to realize their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the analysis Motifuncional adopting this concept of the motivations of the employees.
The studies demonstrated that they judge their company based in a predetermined Doxa that allows them, through the image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the factors of mobilization, managers can monitor, anticipate and anticipate its "social" and relocate the performance management Derecursos human "in the place".
In this way, create a favourable ground for the orderly development of a strong and effective intelligence of business.
Oslo speech: "just war" Obama receives praise of the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech Obama had made on Thursday.
The Tories, who had discredited the award to Obama on 9 October, this time welcomed the speech, just as Sarah Palin, the former candidate for the vice-presidency for the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, principal of right wing of the Republican Party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she had addressed the issue of the war "sometimes necessary ” in its newly published memoirs.
In my view, the war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to make, but it is necessary.
We must stop terrorists, noted.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, this Thursday in Oslo, was devoted to justify the recourse to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had “ done a very good job ” in Oslo.
I think that the speech was actually very well, it welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the reference to “ the existence of evil in the world ”, in the words presidential.
At times, the speech I found very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program “ The Takeaway ”.
The former elected representative, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to listen to "a President of left" when reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in The Washington Post, Obama delivered a very American "speech".
In addition to “ citizen of the world ", such as" always "," spoke as an American President "to remind the European" living in a security bubble that they created and they do much to preserve it, "Gerson said.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawkish of the Bush, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "dull, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the Web site of National Review Online.
To the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify the recourse to force.
When the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocents, warned.
However, the press centre left commended the President.
Los Angeles time, though still believe that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, described his speech "overproduction" above all for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo "should serve as a road map for guiding the international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented excited the Californian newspaper.
Obama delivered the speech that was necessary, "the New York Times, judged “ while bleak and instructive".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations speechmaking, the health sector unions of roads and the Tlf (transport and logistics of France), the only organization employers that stayed until the end, agreed on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat on the supply of Christmas.
During the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" with the agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators farewell at the dawn of the Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement late in the morning.
Even when three organisations (Fntr, Unostra, a closed Otre) withdrew.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 h was necessary for all agree and the text was firm to 18 h.
The conflict had been very detrimental to the companies "and" it was feared that disturbs the end of year holidays, "Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (transport).
The rate per hour increases of 8.72 EUR to 9,06 to low wages.
It is not much, but started with great disadvantage, explained Patrice CLOs (FO).
As well, we are going to give the order to our militants that has more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there may always be some rebel dissenting, added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the Tlf, acknowledged that it is “ a good deal ”, although it was “ difficult to grant high wage increases taking into account the international competition ".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 monthly to low wages and 100 to 120 euros in the highest.
Is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) is recognized as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel expenses of the 3 per cent and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a paid extraordinary and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “ a low of EUR 100 million on employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the Finance Bill of correction for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms.
The signing of Tlf allows that the agreement is implemented, firstly, businesses subscribed to this organization and, secondly, the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour make an extension.
"As soon as possible," will be assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The Fntr complained that she was a “ naive ”, as the EUR 100 million ” had already been pledged to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to a analysis discussed by the parties, but to frustrate those who want to eat Turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner, regretted the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.
RER: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagreed with the proposals of the RATP
The conflicts in the RER, the largest urban public transport line in France, they are going to continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the RATP, no agreement was reached and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to its request for premium.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, Saturday and Sunday only move trains between 10 p.m. and 20 h, at the rate of one every two in the central section (train between the defense and nation) and a train out of four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the Snfc shall be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change.
The Galleries Lafayette, expected 200,000 customers every day, were happy "the RATP strive to provide service to the great shops".
The RER crosses from West to East, the city of Paris.
The RATP from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost no train at Valley, as had been planned.
On Thursday there was chaos in the terraced thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained that "an hour and a half earlier had been lifted to reach hours.
The station Saint-lazare is not overwhelmed, indicated the SNCF, which provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER to the SNCF operates from Cergy-le-haut or to this arriving or departing from the station Saint-lazare to join the metres.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, a meeting held with the Directorate on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects to the RER: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what we want drivers who demand a premium that they must, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP is even between parentheses its premium, commented outraged the CGT, pointing out that the direction "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the roads sector had solved".
A further meeting is expected on Monday to “ a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession, the RATP.
What also led to the trade unions to say that the company "is not imported the users of weekend".
By the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a Committee at headquarters, in Paris.
Then the direction, which until then was refusing to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to appease the waters ”.
The conflict could spread to the RER B Tuesday, after the Unsa and indépendants have submitted a notice.
The unions called a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, CFDT, FO Sud, indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers daily.
The drivers of RER, all in the second grade of her professional career, charged from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and EUR 600 to 650 of premiums, for hours with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish Justice dissolved the Özgür party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main party Özgür, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of government, just to extend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity, "declared to the press by the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, but a majority of seven votes is needed to obtain the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the party leaders, among which are its President Ahmet Türk and the Member Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity of which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that members leave the Parliament before being parliamentarians without party label.
The decision follows a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of the “ principles ” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and by many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the window legal political rebels of the PKK.
However, the party claims it has no 'organic' links with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and we call on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the court intervened at the time that the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community face-to-face a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds cease to support the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP stated that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tension in the South-East Anatolian, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, degenerated into clashes with the police over the past weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of south-east populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces of order threw tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators throwing Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, also focused approximately 100 people.
Following the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of Justice going to "deepen the disappointment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, Ndlr) dissolving a party, declared to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, the Energy Minister Taner Yildiz declared.
This decision boycotted the opening of democratic launched by the Government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for the undercover investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, Russian is regarded as the "Silicon Valley".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the headquarters of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with colleges and businesses in the innovation centre of Frankfurt (FIZ).
Were various mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration."
The Vice-alcalde Moscow JURI Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the chief of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In the 2010 travelling to a seminar in Selenogrado representatives of FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Research Centre of Natural Sciences.
Scientific exchanges
It is a scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility to put a foot in the Russian market.
To change the Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
They include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Technology electronic, big companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called “ city of planning socialist "for research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of mountains, in which settled research facilities.
Stuttgart brakes
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 places for nothing is sufficiently high.
To supporters of the project is simply as “ the new heart of Europe ".
The law on. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, that plunged to the capital of the region of Banden-württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites of irremediable.
Stuttgart 21 emerged the spirit of the 1980s.
Workstations with Riel, just in the middle of the city, were then fossil of engineering of the nineteenth century, acting as checks of a modern rail traffic, because formerly an enormous amount of time was needed for harnessing the locomotives of back ahead.
Rolling, stop in its tracks continue; but it should be done.
And why should disappear the terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step, which is approximately half of the journey of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan of "heart of Europe".
The S21 really will be initiated, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious know that designers in the capital Hessiana and Bavarian is almost unaffordable implement the reduction.
The rail terminals of course also have more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with unity Tractora and cart driver at both ends.
Not however: Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built ice towards Ulm already will be launched.
The federal political and communal have prepared well.
The rail continues, also because the risks of large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic is the taxpayer and not the State.
From the point of view, the draft still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, many green areas, probably of generated by computer the designer.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The station and the road are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to an enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time were not given the competition from low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening the transport of goods, since the rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than those made by lorries on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affect many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zuavos.
This is the official figure.
The experts believe that between 10 and 15 billion is more realistic.
Money is certain that in the next decade lacking in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
In total 60 larger projects are in the list of the Ministry of Transportation.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of tracks long through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route at a slow pace.
Be urgent here the accelerator pedal.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international carriage of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The Government reviewed the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the autonomous Parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is to lodge an appeal to the decision on the prohibition of night flights of Hesse Administrative Tribunal.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts in the legal research of the Vgh judgment, of more than 400 pages, as the minister of economy, said Dieter Posch (FDP).
The Administrative Court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date, in the case of the construction of the runway north-west planned at the Frankfurt airport, the state should regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged in the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide whether until 4 January, to lodge an appeal against this judgement.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the government representatives to reject the appeal before the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer-gümbel group, called the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of prohibition of night air traffic, made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of floor.
Is difficult enough if you let him keep his word, the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir said, referring to the slogan of the FDP "we kept our word."
The Minister Posch rejected the recrimination Schäfer-gümbel, which the federal government would be trying through misrepresentations of law and tricks still obtain their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition would not like to act on the basis of a "rapid" first impression.
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As well as the opposition, not have never been the tenets of their group about the prohibition of night air traffic.
The US banks back aid provided.
The big American banks battered by the crisis are stripped of their state.
The “ Bank of America "returned a one-time aid that he had paid the bank rescue fund tarp of a total of 45 million (approximately EUR 30 billion).
Citi plans to repay the state aid and also the group, according to a report by CNBC of United States.
With this the institutes are free from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the restriction on the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had secured about $19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the amount taken from the fund itself, which had few resources, including the sale of items.
The banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked the Wednesday night especially to American taxpayers: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The House banking had miscalculated the effort of the takeover of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The group Citi also aims to make money in the market in order to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the State.
The CNBC reported source of circles, the American bank could announce already for this Thursday the increase in their capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the group Citi did not comment.
In June it had returned its aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Election rapid
In the end, it was faster than was thought.
Just two weeks after the Administrative Council of Zdf (German television channel) euro-area as editor-in-chief of Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, Director of the study Principaldel Zdf in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But certainly also influenced the further damage to the Director of the Zdf Markus Schächter, if this proposal is not adopted in the Administrative Council.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The result of the vote was not yet concluded the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the Administrative Council with its proposal to renew the contract for a further five years of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against it. The removal of Brender was a bitter failure to Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
For the majority of the Union in the Administrative Council already weeks before the election had indicated, to support Brender.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief of had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Sr.roland Koch.
Declined another mandate of the editor-in-chief of prestigious with the argument, under the leadership of Brender news Zdf have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections, there were protests due to this, in which Flageló political influence on the Zdf.
The end until had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which described the conduct of Koch as unconstitutional.
But did not.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
Studied policy, pedagogy and romance.
After worked in the station "Südwestfunk" and "Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper."
In 1983 was changed for the Zdf, in principle the informative "Heute-journal."
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 rapporteur editor-in-chief; 1991 / 92 staff correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Director and morning programme driver "Morgenmagazins; until 2001, director of the foreign policy of the Zdf; since then Director of Zdf study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint then the dismissal of Brender, which was chosen this Wednesday and journalist of the year by the magazine "medium Magazin means ”.
The opposite of Koch in the Administrative Council, the President of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federated States should change the state convention of Zdf in such a way that the proposals of the Director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the bodies of the Zdf was removed by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the Administrative Council with a smart move: criticised heavily by the dismissal of Brender Guild.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence therefore could Schächter name for the post of head of drafting without losing face, as the Administrative Council could vote, without falling under suspicion to post a henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded all forms to the liberal left.
The academic careers are cleared
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated States finally relented. At a meeting of the ministers of education and culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions in the cases of bachelors and masters.
The students should in future be able to overcome their careers.
For example agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: basically each module of the race should conclude with a single review.
Also the aim is to examine the workload of the students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable".
The policy and the universities want to simplify further the recognition of examination results between universities within and outside of Germany.
The Federated States commit themselves to draw more flexible rules structural together to careers of bachelor and master.
Regulations of the federated states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June by the ministers of education and culture and the rectors of universities talk constantly of the improvement of power and conclude with a successful career (Estudiabilidad).
Now for the first time there was talk of a content.
The so-called Accreditation Council agreed to drastically reduce the amount of tests: "Each module concludes with only one consideration," said in a document of 30 pages, seeking to regulate partial adoption of the academic careers.
With the significant reduction of burden of reviews "is intended to avoid the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the Estudiabilidad, explained the director of Accreditation Council, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Also in a future "Estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined in detail in terms of unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of..
The courses.
The students would have “ the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage the own initiative ".
These rules resort for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "Reacreditar again ” every five years. But this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be to nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Council, that is installed by the federated States.
The Ministers of Education and Culture called the federated States in October influence on the agencies, in such a way that the quantity of raw and reviews are not too demanding or demanding.
In some States Federated universities and technical schools already agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now only Renania-platinada assured provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities should implement mentoring programmes and student counselling, as well as strengthen and foreign offices.
The land and the universities seek to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
Parliament at the beginning of 2010 the government wants to take a novel of the University Act.
According to her should be enough only a review for the completion of a career pattern.
The shape of the race should be made more flexible, it also seeks to ensure the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitate accessibility to master.
Until the end of next year is to examine all careers about their "Estudiabilidad".
This Government and the opposition on Thursday discussed again on the conditions of the land.
In addition to praise was also critical of the decisions.
In the Board of Directors at the federal level of the university groups Juso (Young Socialists) Seexigía, that the shape of the education policy should no longer be “ behind closed doors ” of the Ministers and the university rectors.
At the latest after the strikes of the education, now students as main involved should be able to say.
The President of the Board of Regents (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave its support to students: "We need the experience of the students," said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers for Education, with which the HRK deliberated on a joint document on reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not sufficient: the Union requires a legal right for each student with the title of bachelor the possibility of access to a master race.
Federated States also have to ensure that the current generation of students of bachelor exist in enough study places for a future master with the best possible conditions of study. It reported a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Federated States have Quecontratar appreciably more teachers.
But on a greater access to masters, the ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
“ enter and leave Germany is virtually unchecked "said the first line of a poem by Lyric Werner Söllner in fragments language Desequilibrantes, which usually addressed the arrival in Germany experiences of a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as reader in a publisher of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To Söllner gave him several literature awards, in 1993 provided memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt the Goethe University, and since El2002 is Director of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm forum in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on “ German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured its Securitate files "
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Securitate secret service against fellow writers Alemanes-rumanos, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in the year 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
The attempts of recruitment had started slowly, principles of 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who is not sufficiently defended in the face of attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate", completed Söllner.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and his controversial literary unparalleled with mechanisms of dictatorial rule, shaking the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors are nationals of Romania for a case that highlighted the divisions and the evil of a political system, which is based in control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is what we know so far, is not only author, but also the victim.
In his dossier of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said the scientific literary Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner, and stressed the positive influence for him Delim Walter.
He was excused or advocated in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the need to do this," he said.
The declaration of Söllner public in this way and this was unexpected, the confession of a Ex-disidente and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securitate-spitzel Gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in the month of July in the weekly “ Zeit ', having read its own dossier of 914 pages.
Those involved probably will have speculated and known in some cases, what names were hidden behind pseudonyms of Sorin Voicu and also of Walter.
In contrast to the review of the files, Stasi a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the issues of control by the Securitate is still fairly vague.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the Securitate files (Cnsas), corresponding to the authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then it rather crawl.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of files.
An interview, following the awarding of the Nobel Prize in literature Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the presented.
"She has psychosis," to end the questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed possible show without round under the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions inevitably arise with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame silent.
Why right now and who would cause harm? the calm of the listeners reaction to the confession of Söllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this history is governed by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel prize for literature, is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, he addressed a taxi Mercedes C Class a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the Foreign Service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very pleasant celebration of Christmas, in which the sporting goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man in the feature bald had hired a driver, because they still did not know the city.
It would also have lead the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and it was not intoxicated with joy the 55 years.
Had been a pleasant, but tomorrow begin the work again.
Or start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been employed just three days earlier: "It is true that we achieve the seven-eighths of end ”, namely in the Champions League, thanks to 3: 1 triumph against Unirea Urziceni, Romania, “ but we cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by the success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "task much more important “ Les expected the next Sunday, said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat the success of the “ real ” classes in Mainz in everyday of the League.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, following rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots
The prizes at the end of the Champions League (parties to the 16 / 17 and 23 / 24 February / parties back 9 / 10 and 16 / 17 March), Sortearán on 18 December in Nyon.
So it remained limited joy by the explosive entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the course Salvador, short time they had inspired the baffled Profis of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on its strengths, urged more be launched, repairer of souls Gross explained his recipe for success that simple sounds, but with the therapist Babbel already had ineffective.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, “ when in football there is a new impetus, sometimes things that had not been thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after a pause of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly become the best player local thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “ phenomenon ” received with the proverbial “ wind ” and the manner of work of the new head: “ He is a man who intervenes fund, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And that is what has been missing, obviously, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the steering sporting Horst Heldt
But the Vfb Stuttgart on record.
As well as gross, the players and the Administrator refrained from overstate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of relay and completely overtaken Romanian of the guests.
Also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had reached the sad, to think Khedira.
And the steering Horst Heldt warned that while there was a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to hold in his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters from three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, who returned to date in the form of a television interview, sent just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others take, and Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
It had criticized weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change its coach by the pressure of young fanatics.
It was also eliminated his day off after the Games Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were “ marked by the pure selfishness ", he replied Heldt, and announced Zaguero implications.
No longer will probably be friends forever, the two Cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all others in that, without the previous efforts with the team of coach replaced, would not have been possible had the spectacle of great strength and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had “ an important participation in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed the man in the suitcase full of plastic.
Fight the world cup of heavyweights
Ardent mourning in Bern: time and again the challenging Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight world champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the WBC Association expired on Friday evening to Saturday in Berne the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision points (120: 108, 120: 108 119: 109).
For Klitschko was its third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, we could not make the Noqueo that all had hoped.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to give due to injuries.
The challenging Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
To 17000 viewers in the arena of Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 metres, it wanted to dictate the fight on all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches lower, than before the mourning was proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was running a time and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not be decisively to its objective dangerous willy-nilly.
In general terms, the passive Johnson too little for a challenging, and only sought through the rounds.
While Klitschko was provoked by words and gestures, their beaten only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, which bore full 12 rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenging some scandal in the Swiss capital had already been.
Had insulted Klitschko as “ ugly zombie ”, which “ does not know nothing ”.
The weight, the champion was left on Friday to take Johnson's glasses sun of the nose “ to see their eyes. "
Fourth triumph following the return of Klitschko
Also at its 4th fight following their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, expired in the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered “ their ” belt of the WBC, which before had to surrender without a fight.
This year fell after in their title defences to Juan Carlos Gómez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the British belt belongs to David Haye, after he Destronó Nikolai in November Valujev, 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Presumably, the company which promotes the fight against Klitschko is planned at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack the opposition: the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called liar the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, because of false information on the matter Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence, Karl-theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), deceived with knowledge.
In the transmission of news "Tagesschau" on Saturday, broadcast on television ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister “ knowingly had not told the truth "about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, usually said: He said lies.
The order to kill would be given without taking into account the rules of the international force protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that had NATO, and read the Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday had been released in this attack was not only to destroy the abducted lorries, but also killing intentionally to two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack in the United States, requested by the Kunduz German commander, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation of the NATO, 142 persons died or were injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Saturday in the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to make immediately to the federal Parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really known about the incident.
The Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's policy in Afghanistan, and whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, called Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The Ministry did not influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended doubts on the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely on the background of the attack on the convoy.
Had said that they had been officially denied the existence of the reports of the NATO and had concealed details sensitive to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two senior officials, it transpired that they even had pointed to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert had requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung. "
So far has received no response, it was said.
The Ministry on Saturday was expressed to the criticisms to make, and suggested that this be clarified in the federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which will be the next Wednesday.
Worlds Oníricos
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and the addicts were fading the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are dark with closed eyes rocket-fire in our rooms, we can overcome unhindered to more wild imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experience States similar to dream during the vigil, or seen and heard things that others do not see or hear, is considered the most modern in the Western world as crazy or addicts, or at least as Maniático.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drugged.
The blame is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes are blurring the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness warning modified Oníricamente may appear in different forms, in the best of cases, call visions, and at worst, madness.
Though we may distinguish the triggers and effects, they can refer to similar processes the visions of the mystique Hildegard von Bingen, experiences Psicodélicas of prophet of the new era Carlos Castañeda, possession Chamánica States, and psychotic and delusional.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the substances has been Descarrillado neural communication in the brain – above all, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and Acetilcolina – and was disturbed the interaction among various parts of the same.
During a psychoses Schizophrenic very frequently appear hallucinations complex thoughts and crazed.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied the philosophers and doctors from the old time.
Aristotle approached the hallucinations as a form of sleep in state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great image of the state of madness with the Oníricos', to Sigmund Freud, the dream was even" a psychosis, with all the absurdities, Alocadas, formations and attractions ”.
Is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over it, is floating near the roof of the room.
He is a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, nose red as blood, deformed, Rechinando teeth.
They are pursuing, Patean with heavy boots and Flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices shrill and malignant resonate from the walls and the radio.
Can no longer withstand the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. draws two cables of stereo, Amarra to form a knot of hanging, and fixed in a hook on the ceiling.
You climb in a whelk and the noose around the neck.
Salta.
The rope set loose.
What you serve as a lesson! the voices in a chorus that bursting, the eardrums, “ see the clinic and do you heal! "
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The case produced was the LSD.
His diagnosis is psychotic Esquizo-afectiva-paranoide, is also Maniaco-depresivo, takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, three years ago is married.
In the most fearful psychosis I experienced the anguish and despair, said.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is as the second most common disease after the Depression.
In an acute psychosis schizophrenic, most often those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and interior, and fall into a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, labouring in the relationship, or disorders.
Particularly widespread is to hear voices: voices that giving orders, comment or dialogue.
Are also frequent the hallucinations optical.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signs, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deep layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, said Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time entering into a passive role, as in a dream, is overwhelmed by events and cannot organize active.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, wake, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
In contrast to a dream, Fuchs said, “ the spatial and sensory structure of the reality in the psychosis remain in principle. "
The paranoid and delusional thoughts are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown why our brains for mishaps.
According to Fuchs, the states of exception can take any person to lose touch with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that addition of genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that affected suffer brain damage.
Suspect that the brain's neural maturity is in an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system, which manifests itself in all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – the stress or traumatic experience may be the trigger psychosis when there is already a provision.
In the same way, the hallucinogenic drugs can lead to psychosis, as they interfere in the system of the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical psychotic of all this is that the people are with their hallucinations and take medication very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, said Professor in Psychology Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
The perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often hinges on the point of view.
Kasten collects from ten years ago reports of hallucinations and visions, and analysed the results in the paper die Irreale Welt in Unserem Kopf (unreal world in our heads), issued last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, together with psychological problems such as borderline personality disorder or depression, also often diseases such as tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and injuries Craneoencefálicos.
In a surprising and under specific conditions, the brain healthy people were also suffering hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according Kasten, are composed of memories that normally are repressed.
Arise when the brain areas that are processed sensory perceptions are hyperactive or are little hamper; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli.
The drug can cause this state in the same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of Amores brain or other states of exception.
In Jüngeren Studien GAB bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an Mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination Erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and sent to a secondary school.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
At times, for recreation, a clumsy boy with long hair and dark led the floor.
When she replied, the other students look Soprendidos; nobody, a part of it, hears or sees the boy.
Believe that the timid girl is a Ensoñadora a bit odd, but Sarah K. knows that it is not dreaming.
Is awake and sees and hears that boy, the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank.
Can feel even their presence, at least for a few moments.
Is a pleasant, likes the boy.
Sometimes it is wondered whether is mad.
Also aware that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because Professor – their eyes and ears – is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest explains so visible and audible the mathematical equations.
In the evenings, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes too late and is little, not know if it is happening or dreaming, the images that we see, the nose or the girl with bloody cuts on arms and legs, appear to their eyes open or closed.
Me in peace, shouts to the figures.
To their parents and friends told you nothing, would that is insane.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. has Hoy20 years.
Adopted last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has been in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that it is not mad.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a time begin to take hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is vacated Yse responsible the same sought entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter only, had little fear of other children and often playing alone.
His delusional began when, with 13 years, learned that the man called Daddy since that use of the reason is not his biological father.
Since the noise and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process impressions real and noise, as Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. “ every experience, "says Kasten, “ takes place in the brain, the reality is planned there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, that seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies the night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people not differ in nature from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, people psychologically healthy are able to recognise their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation between dream and hallucination
In this imaginary world too focused on what aware, the experiences often generally Patologizarse, said Michael Schmidt-degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the hospital's psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic Florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful but that also involves something positive and creative – the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as a dream.
The Oníricas hallucinations are almost dreams very detailed and complex that the person experiencing considers real and subsequently cannot differentiate from staying.
The States aware Oníricos arising in extreme situations associated with a trauma or a disease, as for example in patients with Polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a paralysis driving fully Conscientes. die EIB Vollem Bewusstsein eine Motorische Lähmung Erleben.
According Schmidt-degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or of the world due to a motor disability total and permanent, it replaces a very dangerous situation real by an imaginary world and that is decoupled from the reality.
A form of extreme situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change occurs in the world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive to give meaning and interpretation to form an unbearable situation that our own building capacity allows us not sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the report
Also the historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zurich, described his experiences Oníricas in his book Herzenwechsel as of a rescue of the soul.
Was 49 years, when their conscience is engaged in trips of several days after a heart valves with heart transplant operation included while his body was sentenced to the inertia in the station of intensive care.
Claussen descended into a world created by the same and visited once strange places: was caved in a bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium in a train, a robot for their health.
Was in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by noble produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike was kidnapped in her country of origin, surf on the hospital bed in the Alps with snow Firn and encountered a Mafia-like Korean.
What gives these facts on imaginary, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these travel Interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips mental, many years later, are much more clear, even in the details irrelevant.
Even more clear and intensive than actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience diluted the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard.
By Finally, Oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile the internal reproduction of the reality outside, even when we are awake.
Every amendment of the state of consciousness, summarized the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience which, on the other hand, can be fully enriching.
The snow can come
Gross
The children will be responsible for the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert gross wants to make his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, told Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – the publisher Hubert gross sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and are committed to join the company, confirmed gross, 69 years, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put 7,500 employees to their children, if they are not adequately trained for this.
That would with the children and also with the company.
Gross announced on Thursday that he will retire from January of the presidency of the board of directors and that Paul-bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, 52 is since 1999 Member of the direction of crude.
In a start was responsible for technology.
More later, the Treasury and with it came the responsibility on the heritage of the company. following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, the alien, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the publisher.
The children of gross are 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently was 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to “ bridge the gap of 10, 15 years, "according to gross.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Gross said the family businesses are not immune to the decline: "This has always affected families are transmitted by the quest for search for capital, which have misjudged and thought that might be raised as well as the largest player.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur," says Gross.
I do not see this as a political tutor of this country, as was Springer, and I do not want to play with the “ time ” in the World League; these businesses have become too large.
The promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, without possibility even to see some kind of Deputy or sail for the network.
Enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the US when the Time magazine named one of the products of the year.
See on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to the Smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has drawn two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free data service for life to change to pay six times more for the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday in the event Web, is the European version of the invention and its third Encarnaciónn.
Is as limited than its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, of approximately EUR 12 per month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a cafeteria with WiFi (or a FON) to consult the post.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and time that would be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated ear pulling of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe hardly had a discernible effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
That a Aparatito as Fonpeek (it is curious that bear the name of FON when no WiFi) achieved this type of charges mean that operators are starting to think differently and studying various proposals to recoup their data network.
Kindle includes trafficking, is another good example of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and bagpipes.
Why is a connected device and paid the purchase, month to month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fonpeek, an option to purchase with access for life as Peek already has in us
Not because there will buy.
I watch my mail in the phone.
I hope because I believe that it is a model more fair to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The colour fetish of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the tone of the American first lady.
If it came to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a clothing and shelter of this colour, has chosen the same to follow, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has been a model very similar on two occasions: in addition to being a similar colour -amarillo Verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts -vestido, jacket and shelter of the same Tela-, and Adornaba with a large embroidery or collar.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat Vestaurio.
But the question which are processed the two suits are very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fat, in Oslo is a velvet with stamping lace.
The supplements have also changed: shoes Greens as a means Tacón last time, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
And also different is the hair: a included in this occasion, loose the previous mane.
The 75% of working mothers had problems working for its maternity
The discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for the younger generations that women want to be mothers.
This is reflected in the 'fertility study and employment history of women in Spain', developed by the Csic in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt in that respect: 75% of working mothers has been limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence in couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work.
Those which do not have a work outside the home, working part-time, or have a stable work, initiated before the coexistence, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delaying the coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
“ women between 35 and 49 years with permanent jobs have their first child, on average, 3.7 years since the launch of the coexistence, which increased to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time record vital to them, which has led them to postpone the Union and the arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of work performed exerts great influence on the maternity even less on the timetable for the matching, "explains the researcher of Csic Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that unlike the age of women at marriage and having the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the education level, the greater is the age at marriage and have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which are basic and higher education have been mothers for the first time to an average of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"It also establishes another division between women in terms of their level of education.
While those who have elementary school, marry and have their first child before achieving a stable work, of average levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to obtain stable employment as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child ”, detailing Delgado.
Diane Kruger also applies
L'Oréal Paris just add a new name to its envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year onwards, the German actress will become image of various products of the trademark, sang the universal slogan of 'because I avail'.
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses of international scene, joins a number of other famous recruits de L'Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie McDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before that, the last to enter into such select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In paragraph male, the cosmetics brand also account with ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (colleague Evangeline in 'lost').
The British Fashion Awards
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives -diseñadores and models, yesterday and today is met in the annual delivery of their awards, held in London, the Royal Court justice.
No one missing.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, elected best model of the year.
The poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent away in poker of ACES '(Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 30 of X-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
Gender does not do so in the foreseeable and frightening (profiled biographical, life and work), but looking something like the heart of ignition of character creator.
The journey has its Excitaciones and Vincent spared no scares or Iluminaciones.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and Relecturas.
Here I will leave some snapshots.

Cowardly aggression
The last week, my mother of some 70 years of age walking by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent together, and our dog, a copy of race mestizo, salvaged from the Perrera and with no more than six kilograms of weight and, without a word, beat him two kicks that he left the dog Malherido.
Our indignation is glaring because there is no fun in a wanton aggression to a small animal and defenceless, which incidentally, was tied.
Add to this the embarrassment that resulted in a Mrs strolling calmly and, when lashed to these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a madman that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly or, in short, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday any by a traditionally quiet neighbourhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we a complaint in a nearby police station we doubted that will much and not only generate sensitivities, clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
Do not understand is happening between the young to consider funny maltreatment free to a defenceless animal that we love, companionship and friendship.
Do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the helmet use
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmet, mainly among the young motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the hull, since that is the only element of protection capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while touring motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that the campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond design and manufacture products every day more safe" and stated that also contributes to this goal through other measures of educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of a motorcycle helmet on, under the slogan 'to be or not to be', will be a first phase in the distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles, with the goal of maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that the road safety is a constant concern "for the company, as to be a manufacturer of tires for vehicles on two wheels, one of its main purposes is to develop insurance products.
Climb the sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicles market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase from 12.6% in 2008 and, what is more important, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, Pearl, it put in quarantine as the reference with which the comparison is writing of 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60 per cent decrease from the previous year.
Consequence of this is that, despite the resurgence of accumulated last month, enrolment in these 11 months are 40 per cent below the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all of the vehicles that made up the hotchpotch of light commercial: derivatives of, pick up passenger cars, light trucks, vans and light trucks / chassis.
Also, have not disappeared the clouds that most affect their demand, although it also are purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which paid in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Of closed so that the restrictions in the tap of bank loans, are other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of poor economic situation.
Against this background and unlike cars, have been of little help aid to the purchase of 2000f.
To them eligible, in addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs to acquire a commercial light of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of CO2 does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witness.
Yesterday, since Ganvam returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to industrial (trucks and buses).
The sellers Association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that has just ended, which estimated a fall in sales (cars and 4x4s) from 19 per cent.
The emergency brake assistance is already mandatory
As happened with anti-lock brakes ABS and about the stability control of ESP, emergency brake assist systems will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest is a period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, his way of working, can also help to avoid many collisions.
The emergency brake Assistant it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, the system detected the Pisotón that gives the driver.
But this keeps the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to tread the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use any force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid, however, requires the maximum the brake system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could avoid per year up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which are involved pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - estimated that one of every four claims would be avoided with - when damage is to popularize the so-called intelligent emergency brake system.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or house) detects obstacles and alerted the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, helps increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it fails to react, and although the conflict is inevitable, device exercises maximum effort to trying to minimize the damage.
General Motors changed to January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - 8 probably according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that going to need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been agreed upon by the affected Party.
And this may make the final document will be presented to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until early 2010.
In contrast, since GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
To this it is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admitted having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aims to acquire Volvo, but reinvigorated the option of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which is backed by the Russian Converg.
In case he did not agree with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if not sold.
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For Desarrolar its last, Jewel, Porsche engineers took Boxster as basis and managed to Adelgazase nothing less than 80 kg, which has left the weighbridges on 1,275 kg.
This led them to dispense, firstly, the ceiling automatic drive which has been compensated by one of tarpaulin with manual, to conserve 21 kilograms; using aluminium doors as the Gt3, 'fall' other 15; away Climatizador, 13; reducing the fuel tank of 64 54 litres, won 7 kg; up Bacquets sports other 12 and tyres light of 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the audio system Cdr-30 provided other six kilograms and changing the gunmen of the remaining doors for a fabric, the kilo.
But with the change of the KDP is also offered double clutch, the test was carried out on a unit with the box six speeds, primarily manual for secondary roads of California, in sections with routes really Revirados
Its behaviour can only be described as high.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: not some time Testábamos a model so small and light that, in turn, transmit such security in the curve, even at higher speeds.
Is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until they get that Esprinte, which slowed, recovery and return to squeeze its motor...
What we ask you. Thanks to their leadership, as forthcoming as accurate, that we share with our hands in the wheel is what the car do.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
Sound of the engine will
The sounds of V6 Boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster) is highly successful and is enhanced by the option 'sport' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already started to earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, from either stopped or recoveries.
The suspensions are firm but not hard or inconvenient.
The asphalt roads with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car Digirió the potholes.
The aid electronic only did act of presence in the whole journey; and that, in some of the curves are ice at dawn and oilspray-and-chip, late in the morning.
In short, a car ultra-light, more fun to drive that one can in the market and that is something more than a simple amendment to the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 EUR.

More disadvantages
The of Ivanovic, wounded but far fewer deaths, needed spinning a couple of dealings with right to breath, and these Mirza Teletovic machine gun, which came with three consecutive triple almost and the help of English and the scoreboard Ribas returned to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to disguise the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring in inflation of assets has been the dominant rationale in the markets, new uncertainty returning to reappear in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the actors take decisions on the future nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize the markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free rein for liquidity at rates close to zero for the financial institutions purchases assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually completed, and without questioning its heterodox policy of liquidity, to throw some sand into the wheels how the ECB did with its auction to the year of the next week.
Thus, the investors doubt the ability of the world economy for sustaining economic recovery without measures as heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the risk reduction of premiums.
The volatilities of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned to rally, although still far from the levels Paranormales that reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were obliged to nationalise private risk and public debt again to be affected.
Of new there is a flight to quality and USA, Japan and Germany have been the shelter elected by investors, causing an extension of the differential of the euro-zone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had been affected by this episode of instability, but in that Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the characterization of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence defenders of moral hazard that trying again to create awareness on those responsible for the global economic policy for braking the destructive effects of the restriction on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to introduce a new day of Thanksgiving.
We, however, Dubai tribal paint to a fight between the emirs to reshape the power in the Emirates and in Greece we have seen before.
A government that public deficit, elections and a new government that pulling the wraps.
Prodi in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin Salvase Hungary of a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that will allow a member country of the euro to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and responsible to its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, how can we expect, we are faced with an episode of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt spreads extended to like the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European differential falling and our continue to expand, then it would be risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators developed are forcing the majority of services to anticipate their recovery and to revise upward its scenarios scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to the burden of a Japan scenario for the Spanish economy bodes much life expectancy to its warning.
Of new, is the whole pint will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, although time "prudently, friend driver".

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the Subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the debate these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed the President of gas Natural-fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few dashes of what that had raised in the Sub-Commission to camera.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion until 2020 and other 60 million between that date and 2030, provided they are kept open the nuclear power plants in operation today.
If this were not so, the necessary investment will not be of 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
That Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, the investment must not be intended to build capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and interconnections international
From 2020, the issue changes and will have to increase the power.
Its bid focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, of renewable energies.
In this case, believes that we need new 18,000 MW, with other sources of support ".
Galán, it considered that the draft law on sustainable economy that the government has just adopted is in line with what his company has been calling, did not make blood with the Royal Decree to encourage consumption of coal, which contradicts the national policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear commitment to long-term ” in this sense, despite the" one-off measures ”, as the president called Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, Galán considers that the investment decisions, although in the long term, it must begin to take longer because late maturing and a stable framework description is needed to address them.

Work in the stake is a tunnel valued at $1.7 billion Australian (1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and donning Hochtief are their rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the next option to that pressing is based in the country as and of motorways.
The City Council wants to point at the end of 2014

The group described as Transcity is headed by pressing, only Spanish in contention, and his companions are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest builders Australian, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the greatest European specialists in underground works.
Against the team from pressing plays the consortium Northern direct, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian managing infrastructure Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.

Play the champions has brought 476,4 million to Madrid and Barca since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.
Therefore, Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, that makes them the third and fifth club that more money have earned in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 Teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the season 1992 / 1993, according to data from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out well from this distribution.
The continent's white club has been the third that more money has been nicked to participate, and the only, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list leading Manchester United and the Bayern Munich, the two teams, as well as more money invoiced to participate the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both against Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is the third largest money has achieved through the champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, four from Italy, three from Britain and two from Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure of distribution of money which applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the Agency chaired by Michel Platini expected join 1.09 billion on the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will 413,1 million for the fixed payment: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round classification (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who had achieved participate received 3.8 million just by being there, plus an additional 550,000 euros for each Party that contested.
There are also bonus to win (800,000 euros) and Empatar (400,000 for each team). Octavofinalistas receive three million each; eight Cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The past four Embolsarán 4 million each.
The champion won 9 million, compared to 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in fixed payments, a club enter at least 7.1 million and a maximum 31.2 million.
