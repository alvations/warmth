The European inflation slid into the food
The rapid inflation, registered in the area of euro, must in the first place to vertiginous growth of the price of food products.
The increase in prices in the month of November has been over what is expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, registering - after the 2.6% of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1% - the Statistical Office of the Union with headquarters in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave as likely a 3% - the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), in contrast to the banks North American, British and Canadian, not to cut the basic interest, under the pretext that the decrease, along with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of the lay-off, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the rate of inflation below, but at least some of the two per cent.
As an observer, the ECB is found in the catch 22: "It is necessary to negotiate" on inflation to subsequently does not have to intervene in this matter.
The inflation of 3.3%, registered in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; as in Spain increased of 3.6 at 4.1%.
Inflation is off in the area of the euro as a result of the galloping nutritional and energy.
The prices at the end of the wheat increased by 88%, and also the listing of the soya reached its highest level since 1973.
Equally, it was necessary to pay a lot more in the 2007 for the vegetable oil and for the milk products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year in 52%, reaching since last month the black gold 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will of 2.1% today to 2.5%, in exchange for the 2009 will diminish as to 1.9.
According to the analysts, annual inflation will stay in the next three or four months about 3%, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that during the year 2008 the ECB reduces twice the interest rates.
Gallup foresees a governmental crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December, the support of the alliance of democratic youngsters increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - a 13% - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the electorate certain parties - due to the greater firmness of the electorate of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71%), with the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the democratic forum and the alliance of the free democrats do not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary: its support in the whole of the population is two per cent.
Among the electorate sure there is a one per cent of supporters in both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41% of the proportion of those who considered to be especially the economic situation of the country, while another 46% believes that the situation is quite bad.
The families, after the most encouraging expectations of the spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in its own economic situation.
As for the next year, the majority of the population is provided with the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth expects an improvement.
In the month of December, 71% of the consulted, superior to any previous survey of Gallup, thought that the President of the government rather desempena badly that well its functions.
The 13% of the consulted trust or trust much Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor orbán counts on the support of the 38% of the consulted.
54% of the population did not trust the head of government at all and 27% do not trust in the President of the Alliance for the democratic young people.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced in front of the person of the head of government without a change of government.
While that after the disturbances in October of last year a 35% considered that it would be desirable to keep the power to the government and to the head of government, at the moment, this proportion is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60% of respondents to the question on the participation replied that he would probably and another 20% said that is likely to participate.
To comparative way, in the "general elections to be celebrated this Sunday" would surely only 55 per cent of the population and another 15% believes its participation probable. By means of the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt of the result of the referendum.
A 74% of the population would disapprove of the payment of the rights of studies, 79% of the service of medical consultations and 84% of the hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions between the participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of the voters would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, the payment for the medical consultations and of the hospital attention.
The most expensive is the auchan, Tesco has quintupled their prices
They supported the average increase the level of the prices of 16% the supermarkets of commercial triangle of gold the, with the difference that this year the VAT has not increased.
Article of it gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16% in the commercial triangle of gold the the usual Christmas of the newspaper, but in all the supermarkets a growth was registered over the thousand huf.
As in December of last year had already gone off "," the prices in the food supermarkets, thus not experienced a drastic increase in comparison with the high point of departure.
However, clearly it is terrifying to consumers the fact that what the last year could buy at a price below the nine thousand huf, at the present time they can do neither by ten thousand.
The basket of it in the supermarkets studied with a minimum of 91 exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand huf.
And the highest value was 10 573 huf.
(in the year 2003 this basket cost 6800 huf.)
The price of liquor and the fish is supported almost at the level of the previous year, but they are registered a strong increase of fillet of Turkey, of the nut and the seed of poppy.
The price of wheat flour and the bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 huf.
Competition does not reduce the price of the product to less than huf.
Equally it was surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola with bottle of two liters cost less than huf, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 huf.
Yet, in the basket of it auchan was the most expensive, while the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of Christmas past quarter of the year, increased with 15, while Tesco, and auchan with nearly 18 per cent of the price that appear in the basket of it.
Comparing the values of the most expensive of last year with the of the most quarter of this year, the difference has been a 12%, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the more expensive of this year has been a 21%.
The average growth was 1480 huf.
Last year the average growth of the prices was of 1206 huf, so that during the Christmas of last year in the prices felt the increase of VAT.
Precisely this process was which destroyed the trade, the supermarkets visibly were unable to take a decision on the margin of prices to apply for each product and to assess the effect of a change of the prices on consumption.
If the retailer plans badly the speed of the circulation of a product, can lose an important benefit in the margin that conforms to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the basket of it reached such ends as a result of the increase of the VAT, the more expensive was over with 1720 huf to value registered in 2006, whereas in the cheapest the difference was only 844 huf.
This year is not produced such extremes, since the highest price of has now been 1630 than last year, and the cheapest also increased with 1284 huf.
Comparing the two seasons, a catastrophic growth registered in the prices in less than 20 months, in the supermarkets grew by more than 30% of the price of the consumer goods from the first necessity.
- but this does not necessarily confirms the numbers of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods registered in the interval of 12 months an increase of price over the 30 per cent.
Thus, for example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the basket of it, in the latter case it seems almost impossible, because in the price of the product that was already quite expensive last year in comparison to the base, it is recorded in the worst cases as soon as a 10% increase in prices.
According to all the indices, the suppliers of feed have a stronger position than the egg, being able to impose the drastic increase in the prices to the multinationals.
The supermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, talk constantly about positive results.
According to our experiences collected, the majority of consumers of the three visited shops, because they are not interested in the prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the food for palettes preserved.
On Wednesday, in the three stores large queues in front of the boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the volumes of sale are low, numerous multinationals complain to the secondary survey because the income are under its plans, and not only in the case of food, but also of the ones.
In many hospitals are saved with disinfectants
This year there have been registered in the hospitals several thousands of infections produced in the first place by the illegal application of antibiotics.
The circumstances of hygiene in the hospitals, the overcrowding of nets, and the overload of staff do not facilitate the control of infection - the department of the national Center of.
In many hospitals are saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago has been diagnosed infection with the in the department of traumatología of hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident was detected the presence of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection took place in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A wounded of a serious car accident they discharged the hospital and the same patient soon had to go back to the hospital as a result of the infection with the, and since then it has not been possible to make an important operation by the presence of the bacterium in their bodies.
Until 10 December of this year have been registered in the national system cases of infection hospital produced by agents - said, Doctor - chief of head of the national Center of.
This means that in the hospitals for certain there has been the number of infections produced by agents, the rest do not have information.
Nearly two thirds of infection (683 cases) must be at the, that is to say to the aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of the human beings carried in its nose the bacteria of the aureus (Ltd) without causing any illness.
The infections produced by the SA (e.g.: inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis infections, infections of) react to antibiotics and are easy to treatment.
However, once it is applied exaggerated or illegally to antibiotics, the bacteria which usually react to antibiotics, transformed into bacteria very resistant to antibiotics and contaminate quickly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example infections of or septicemia in the first place to patients with temporary or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the Agency weakened, old or people of little weight.
In view of the hospital doctor - there is nothing special in the infection of the, these infections are daily in the hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, the only is absent - he said - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"these patients are isolated, the staff takes care of in gloves of rubber and mask and antibiotics adapted to their treatment" - said.
The patients are examined previously to verify the presence of the in their bodies, but even so it is possible to avoid the infection in all cases.
It is fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of the in the majority of cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not facilitate for the prevention of the training and the infection with the pathogenic agents - States.
As this infection fundamentally takes place in hospitals and homes of old, hospitals, should examine the patients and isolate immediately to the ill that they go in their bodies on the.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals is not fashion the capture of exhibitions.
This fact is also due to the fact that the national box of health, not to finance these medical examinations.
So that the majority of cases they come to light public when it is already produced infections of the visible in the patient - the department of the Center.
The European Union makes rigorous charges for the use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also national directives to treat the pathological infections and pictures.
It is necessary to get in which the therapy with antibiotic is directed, that is to say, it would make microbiological examinations to prevent that takes place in the face of resistance to the medicines, but the hospitals do not always comply with this demand.
The capture of samples they are even less frequent in the case of the patients walking or in the basic assistance - stated.
It is saved with disinfectants
The scientific experiments have shown that in the majority of cases the is a patient to another through the medical staff.
Therefore, they redeem a very important role the laundering of the hands, the use of gloves of rubber and masks, but also in this sense experience considerable lack in the hospitals.
The the is contaminated by means of transmission by drops, and the direct contact between people, but in the national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the patient infected.
Moreover, the rooms of hospitals, often are crowded, which are often are very together, although to prevent the epidemic, the patients should be separated, at least for a distance of metres.
Unfortunately, it is possible to experience also - karolina - that in the hospitals of economic situation less favourable was saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, and for that reason there is a greater likelihood for the infection.
In view of, where it is complied with the appropriate measures of prevention, less infections of this type are registered or can stop the transmission of the pathogenic agent.
The government against the agenda
The treatment of infection with the is an enormous cost to the national fund of health insurance, so that in all the countries to fight against it.
In Britain for example there is a government programme to prevent and reduce the cases of the.
Apparently the programme is successful, according to the data provided, infection with the show trend of decrease in England.
The European Centre for the prevention and control of diseases () has among their priorities the prevention of the agents (among these the the) and of the hospital infections that due to these pathogenic agents.

Bulgaria, the real property of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian property market - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards this Balkan country before little mentioned.
What thing, where in the market and those who buy cheaper for the EU, which is recommended quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian of d / Max.
The preferred target for the property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without doubt Bulgaria, with their cheap apartments of the ski runs and the of the beaches.
The regions of bansko, borovec, pamprovo and vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches albena, the "golden coast", the "Costa del Sol," the old sozopol and nesebar, but more and more people look for buildings in the vicinity of kavarna and balchik.
According to the analysts of d / Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later, too, the central area of the country - as veliko tarnovo, gabrovo, Elena, triavna - will wake up the interest of the property developers and more and more people to buy buildings in the area especially cheap rus.
In the same way it will be able to be attractive capital Sofia, the commercial spaces and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive paradise of course of Europe, being able to be so an outstanding destiny for the other two stations, in addition to the summer and winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of bansko.
In view of the analysts, to purchase buildings in Bulgaria, also make an effort to change their life and their way of living.
The majority of the clients are British, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly of Romania.
Likewise the Maltese and Cypriot developers are present and traditionally there are many Russian clients on the beaches of the Black Sea and the paradise of skiing.
The foreign customers can be classified into three groups - Georgi jankov says, regional director of d / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who try to settle here they buy new buildings or renewed for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad shape between 5 and 15 thousand euros, so soon.
They require good communication and access to them is important, in addition to the proximity of a big city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
They constitute the second category the buyers of category (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
They constitute the third group the property investors who do their shopping, with the hope of benefit to medium or long term.
The price of the properties goes in constant growth, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union, Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of the buildings considerably surpasses the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
As reported to the Minister of the environment and hydrology fodor the meetings of experts will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
The experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world to deliberate on the road map of balí that has on the efforts after the period of reduction of emissions, established in the Kyoto Protocol, effective until 2012.
At the present time are carried out lively discussions on the individual among the developing countries and the industrialized.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment does not want to negotiate on the precise numbers, although it tends to come to the agreement that in comparison with the situation of 1990, until the year 2020 decreases with 25 to a 40% the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another great issue of the Conference is that if the industrialized countries, in addition to reduce emissions, or are not willing to provide material and technological to the countries that need it.
It came to an agreement on the also helps to offer to the developing countries.
The background of support, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, it will be led by a board of management integrated by 16 members, probably in the global fund for the environment of the UNO (gef) - written "piac és profit."
The six by hundreds of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, the Minister of the environment and hydrology fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its leading role in the global protection of the climate and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reduce until 2020, with regard to the level of 1990 in 20% of its emissions of gas, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not the "agreement signed after 2012" and is ready to engage in decreasing even 30% if the other great developed regions of the world, and the developing countries are also ready to assume commitments in accordance with its responsibility and its capacities.
Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 committed themselves to decrease in a 5.2%, within this then the 15 Member States of the EU are committed in fulfilling an 8% reduction.
The commitment of Hungary is decreasing with 6% of the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect with regard to the period between 1985 and 87, that our country will comply with - it indicates the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
It is very much what is at stake in balí, since that within two years it will be necessary to sign the international agreement of the climatic policy in the long term, because if it does not, it is certain that its entry into force was postponed for after 2012; in this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol does not be followed immediately by a new international system of reduction of emissions, whose need was notified in its most recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN that deals with climate change, which received the Nobel Peace Prize.
With that, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay, and they will not be able to prevent an increase of more than O C of the average temperature of the earth, the fact that according to the scientists have immeasurable consequences and irreversible.
The British army recruit in youtube
The units of the British army in a distributor of videos publish published on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The first British air force () was the one that took advantage of the services of youtube: the special units displaced persons in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are charging videos on its actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini mounted cameras on the helmets is controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then they are sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
They are already 139 recordings originating from the soldiers of the air force that has been borne in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 billion people.
The British Ministry of Defence is registered in the spring of 2007, under the name of "defence headquarters" and videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the department of the Community of Nations British Commonwealth Office) (as the multinational forces in Iraq - mnfi) have its own channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in view of the Ministry of Defence serve also to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of advertising practically does not cost anything in comparison with the conventional television spots of recruiting - the expert declared the BBC in defence Gordon - however, inevitably have some political message, because in a specific way justifies the reason being the military action decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army also worries about the fact that, in addition to the recordings and censured, in the distributor also keen videos appear, for example on the death of the soldiers: in "the official" films of propaganda, a little hypocritical, the officials talk as a maximum of leaks, without presenting however the bloody part of the battles.
In addition, in the fields of battle of Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet because numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army alone ultimately is taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a form a little different for the recruitment to the free video games of shots called America 's army, in that in the middle of a more or less real situation the player cannot be put directly in place of the soldiers.

This means that - in the day of the parliamentary vote on the law of public health - do not report on the date of the end of the strike begun.
If the national assembly disapproves of the law of public health, the trade unions will withdraw its call to strike.
However, if the law is approved, will meet the strike commissions and will decide on the future.
On the basis of the order of the day of the Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only vote itself above the law of public health in the hours very entered at night, or maybe next to the midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, it will be necessary to include significant difficulties in the transport: in the railways will be employed indefinitely, in the morning can to stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest, and more than half of the inter-city transport of buses of the volán.

The third is that they guarantee, even before 2010, in the case of the anticipated pensions to the possibility of the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason of the strike is that the free trade union of railway workers (sltf) that is part of the trade unions of league, not to accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and railway transport on the sidelines and wait for another different proposal.
Political capital: in the country increases the risk for the guard
According to the division of analysis of risks (risk analysing division) of the political capital to the activity of the guard, constituted in August of this year, with the support of the movement for a Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the "warning on risks" of the written: in relation to the activity of the guard the major political risk constitutes the fact that "with the worsening of the existing ethnic tensions among the population, Gypsy and gypsy of Hungary, even in the short term to be able to take place ethnic violent clashes."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - the representative of the Institute of research.
They stated that everything that is due to one of the main lack of the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of the public life handed over the public debate of gypsy problem to the representatives of the political groups, radical extremists, who could support his political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes the dialogue, strengthens the extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of the violent conflicts - estimates.
In addition to that, according to the Institute of research, the activity of the national guard, by consequence of the great attention to the average national and international, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially when it comes to the stability and the democratic development of the country.
We recall that: from the autumn of 2006 received ever greater publicity and boost the reorganization of the radical groups and the extreme right of Hungary, and that since the summer of 2007 have constituted in the country that numerous organizations themselves of "associations of national".
"The common feature of these groups is that as civil organizations, while openly proclaim the training of its Members for the defence - even armed - (civil defence, it proposes, defender of public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is to say of the State" - add.
They stated: all it takes place in accordance with the method which tries to give him a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of the company with the policy and the political parties.
Therefore emphasize the civil and the form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serve to prevent the legal problems of the legal inscription, but it is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of the vicinity relations.
"in recent months, in numerous States they referred to the guard as a potential danger, whereas the political figures of certain countries, they want to justify its own policy with the creation of the Hungarian guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region "- they added.
According to the Institute of research, the Constitution of the guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that in the whole region is increased the political risks.
They wrote that the guard works in such a way that, for example, the Bulgarian, whose constitution was announced in the month of August 2007 for the Bulgarian National Union (unb) of the extreme right.
The Constitution of the Bulgarian guard due to the massive disturbances of gypsies that took place in one of the quarters of Sofia (krasna poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the unb decided to constitute the custody, with the argument that the objective of the organization is "national".
In its opinion, in the last 17 years were "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, nevertheless the State remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the political capital.
They added: this initiative has caused an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
Just as it is written, indicates the increase of the risk of the ethnic confrontations that certain organizations gypsies of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, constitute its own guard.
As the functioning of the guard has so far shown similarities with the of the Bulgarian, it cannot be excluded that also gypsies of Hungary will react to the threat in a similar way, organizing its own self - can be read in the warning about the risks of political capital.
The Director of investigations of political capital, Attila juhász to the question of the news agency stated: the analysis of risks is one of the activities of the Institute of research.
As he said, every year publish its analysis of risks and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The party does not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law defines precisely the days that is written with red numbers in the timetable, and it has already become a widespread practice that concerning the festival - that next year there will be less - the working days.
Even in the EU or in North America are unitary.
The Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, celebration of the state and festive days.
The festive days fundamentally related to religious holidays and historic events.
We celebrate the new year also: the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest that happened celebrating the year old.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and 23 October, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrated the founding of the State, the 1st of May the celebration of the work, the 1st and 2nd of November we remember our family and friends dead.
In addition, in our country are celebrations of two days Easter, the Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the timetable, our state, national or religious seldom coincide with a weekend, for that is often makes bridge when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the purposes of like that, during the previous Saturdays cannot stay away of work or the school.
Is the Minister of work that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly to change the directly preceding or after the festival.
This legal norm compliance is obligatory for all the owners and their employees, as well as for the employees and civil servants.
It is not obligatory in exchange for the companies and institutions of services that, due to its function, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This year the order of work will be able to be altered only around the celebrations of the end of year: from 24 December virtually stops the life in the country, since according to the experiences, the majority of the people "bridge" during the days between the Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next several of our holidays will coincide with the middle or with the end of the week, so that there will be fewer changes in the working days that this year.
First, the agenda will be modified concerning the celebration of the work so that soon, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
On Saturday, 26 April will be working day, for that to change the Friday, 2 may be festive day.
Another change is related to the celebration of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, it will be necessary to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes under the celebration of the end of the year will be able to rest, since from 24 December does not work in almost anywhere, even though the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six deterrent to turn the life of your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that never receive, innocent lies that happen without realizing: they all form part of our daily folklore "in the work.
It is necessary to decide whether you yourself to the bother you or the confused situations that can to others.
Advice.
$isculpa, forgot to warn you that have sought from the Department of marketing "- one of your colleagues.
That therefore does not go to an appointment?
Ideally feels it and try to repair the matter, calls the marketing department to tell them that they forgot to deliver the message - this is the solution less habitual).
In the majority of the times the matter is resolved requesting excuses.
Before proceeding to explanations, it is worthwhile pondering on things with which you can spoil the life of your colleagues and to avoid them.
You take something that is not yours?
There is no more irritating thing that when you want to take a document, a tool of office or your telephone and do not find them.
You that yesterday the stapler placed on the table, but for this morning disappeared?
Will you find your Pen lost in the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything to your colleagues without asking them to, because with reason they get them to remove its things.
Do not envelopes or post-it the Bureau, because it will be able to be unpleasant when you need them immediately and exhausted before the time.
You gossip about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumours that are already running.
Who, what it is doing and with whom?
Where does and why?
Do not spend around the world, the information (guesswork) that you have on the private life of your colleagues!
Do not abuse the confidence of your colleague, when he shares its most intimate secrets with you!
Buries in yourself what you have heard and not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although it also others know the things it.
You go to leave for disease?
When you call for telephone the office and say that you are ill and you hurt unbearably the head, feel badly or, feel that this day resting; think that others should do your work, your tasks, your work for term.
You did not bother to your colleague!
If you know in advance that the following day will not go to the Bureau, or it will be able to something, for which you have to stay at home, them, so that your colleagues or your head do not have confronted with you lack the following day.
Tarareos, laughs, telephone calls
You are put in your work, but they do sudden him the risillas of your colleagues?
You have heard involuntarily a telephone conversation that it would have been better not to listen to it?
Do not bother to your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, talks aloud (less when you do over his head), protests, constant, expressing your discontent aloud.
All of these can be uncomfortable, even if they are not in depth at this moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do they blame others for a mistake?
You do not blame others if you have not finished in time something, you have forgotten to send a letter or an important message!
Do not refer to the chaos eventually prevailing in the Bureau, nor to the noise that make your colleagues!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms other and must repair the mistake!
Ask how you can restore your lack!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and: habit very convenient for the House, but it is not suitable for the office!
You are not seen a comfortable although your occupation allows!
You are not, respects to your colleagues, and to yourself dressing daily, elegant and clothes when your occupation therefore requires!
You lose interest if you want to comply with the expectations of the public
The car is slowly in the usual jam of the morning.
It sounds a compass in radio: violin electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
Changes to the rate of music, and to the previous tones is added the low and then the voice of a female chorus as a true jewel intervenes.
The Channel reproduces the song of love of zagar.
The musical national life not us a lot with electronic pop of quality.
But now it seems totally different this jam when you listening to the new disc dezagar.
It appears. Some new and interesting songs of national digital little by little are changing the image and although he is fashion the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national pop has shown: there are developments under the sun.
Balázs zságer began his career in the city of pécs, touched on the set of yonderboi until that began his career independent perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same group.
With its project (zagar) and its music, a mixture of jazz, of music and pop electronic, tried to succeed, when I requested it cinematographic (PL.
Ferenc török szezon).
The public knew the Assembly that initially acting alone in small when the magazine wan2 selected its first disc published in 2002 between fifty more important national discs, classifying zagar, along with yonderboi as almost the only national training of trends, capable of being sold in the western markets.
There is no doubt that zagar and its assembly are fashionable, but no one has asked if they take or not gladly this label.
The Assembly reacted as it must react, setting a new and even better disc.
The disk recently launched, entitled cannot walk fly instead be able to open up new paths for them, although the bond itself intends to establish the continuity with the initial in the city of pécs.
Since this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs zságer.
The reference is well above airy, on the flight, but also the airy of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the tendency of the time - the guitar that sounds more strongly, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented the disk in millenáris György ligeti, singer currently working in the United Kingdom with the set the puzzle.
In the disk it includes a real success of the channel wings who ultimately conveys the morning at night popular music. This station took up to the ears of the listeners the music of high flight of of love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($underground).
Then everything is in order (?).
Hvg.hu asked Balázs zságer.
Hvg.hu: after this new success the question arises: the one that you are interpreting, to what extent is it a music devoted to a select public?
Balázs zságer: the definition of public select for me it means little.
In my opinion, there are two types of castes in music, light; not mainstream and underground, no alternative and pop, but in trade and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally alone for the sale, which makes commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
Also, the attitude of the listeners works with this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see any difference between the reception of your music on the part of the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. zs: abroad, especially to the west of the US, the slight music has greater traditions.
We not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years the concerts, but also the old.
They give much more attention to the changes that are produced in their around in the light music, because they consider it to be a part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what role has the public in your work?
It matters who are, where they are, and how much they are the people who listen to your music?
B.zs: of course I feel good to see that more and more people are present at our concerts.
But we have never informed music to the market.
Not to compose music for any objective, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather felt in the concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to comply with the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
Hvg.hu: to what extent do you intend to follow the example of yonderboi?
It works alone and made his career rather the west of us.
B.zs: we do not follow their way, in spite of the fact that sometimes try to compare our music with him.
We rather work in equipment, trust in the musical presence of another and leave that to unfold.
At first it was inevitable that compare our work with the music of yonderboi, since many of us to initiate our career in his group and we undertook the other way.
Hvg.hu: in the list of successes of mr2 wings of love is in the first place.
Many people have heard for the first time on behalf of zagar in relation to this song.
You opened conscientiously with this style, towards a more extensive layer?
Zs.b.: it does not intend to compose great successes and sell our disk with these successes.
This song is something more than that.
We added at the end of the disk, trying to relax after the sound orgy of disc and of the heaviest subjects.
Hvg.hu: how have you selected six singers?
Why precisely to them - which was the main reason?
B.zs: the idea was to create a choir style.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the 'good voice of our own national musical scenario.
Thus created this chorus of six women - or seine, kutzora edina, judie jay, bori péterfy, enikõ hodosi [] and juci németh - which then was termed divas of underground.
Hvg.hu: you compose exactly like the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.b.: this song, there was a long time ago in instrumental version, and when we had already all the material the disk, we think that something is still lacking.
The suitable attracted the edge.
Yet that night I recorded the song that later the girls learned.
Practically all arrived at the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous.
I remember me, I was very much time, but of course the divas needed also.
With my voice it had not worked with so many.
Hvg.hu: in the concert as in the disk it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There is no '(except the brief alone of Judy jay), do not have proper role, sing all together and not more strongly that the music, for which the music not only his songs.
It is also in the scenario is located in the background.
Deliberately?
B.zs: they are in the fund simply by technical problems.
On the other hand consciously do not want to distribute roles'.
The song is also about it, on which we forget our ego, that who where it has come and where it is going, we leave so that those wings, the wings of love lift us.
He had wanted to achieve that also others feel that state of mind that we feel when this song was born.
Hvg.hu: to which more work?
Zs.b.: in the musical composition actually to any, rather, at the time of mixing there was more difficult pieces.
For example dorian Gray's dilemma in that I am touching on a piano of citizenship or the rock 'n' roll goes to the girls, where for a long while does not want to work and then, little by little was put in its place as a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your favourite song in the new disc?
Zs.b.: this constantly with the concerts and because I have already released "," the disc.
Now is a fool, escape from the earth, and never the same.
A treacherous's risks billions for their inferiority complex
An unfair malversador.
So as to its former employee, Jerome kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Bank of Czech trade.
For it was nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than kerviel was a big player who wanted to compare and his colleagues, without a doubt, with good capacities.
Sensed a long time ago, unlike all the large banks Czechs, the crisis in the American market of mortgages.
"is a fragile character" was allowed to be heard of their superiors, such that it was sent to the police.
But what is removed from the responses of kerviel according to which the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that it was a question of a man who at the end of last year was a profit of more than 1,600 millions of euros, thanks to their businesses.
Crisis, not only in America
"All what I wanted to do was to make money for my bank" is assured in his answers.
Indeed, in the summer, managed to win over the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw come at the beginning of the year.
In February started to listen to some news on the so-called mortgages priority offered to customers of low income or to those who in the past had problems with the payments, and that those clients would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe and wagered it correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits overcame 1,600 millions of euros.
"when already gained my first 500 million do not know as" confesses to notify and adds, that has not been left to it, in all.
During all the examination declared that it had falsified records in such a way that it was not his discovery.
Even went so far as to cheat the leaders, even when the market began to be interested in their businesses.
The risk is turned into benefit
It was afraid that it was going to discover?
Rather, it does not.
"I thought that he had gained 1,600 million for the Bank and that from this simple fact, that would be happy."
Where did it take so much strength of will to risk in this way?
In my position should work gradually.
It began to work in Société Générale in the year 2000, after studying in Lyons.
Its annual salary is handled among the 51 dollars.
Two years after it was already assistant's market and in the year 2005 became's market with an annual salary of you of.
Nevertheless I knew that it was never going to gain as much as the others.
"in my first interview in the year 2005 already observed that I looked with caution.
Due to my training and also my personal and professional progress "described kerviel to researchers.
But, at the time of my entry in the business came the great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a starting mechanism, and wanted more.
If it is that desire, you leave
"this is like a snowball" said the police.
But it says that the leaders know all this or that they.
"while made money, closed eyes."
Only that, after the coup, arrived at the beginning of this year.
In a day lost billions of euros.
After the end of the week to half of January wanted to erase all mark.
When the Monday arrived at work, as it did in the Bank.
And two days later, the Bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros for his fault.
And how they manage to locate?
It happened to be a suspect from their holidays.
"I chose only four days for the last year.
The corridor which does not have holidays is a corridor which do not want anybody to glance at his dossier "finished kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of obtaining 365 billion
The Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission, a total of nine of the operational programmes that the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Crowns).
It is practically half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can get to Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will come to approximately 125 billion Crowns for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion Crowns of the company and innovation.
The greater part of the money will be devoted to the transport, up to 150 billion.
The agenda of transport is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain the fund.
This money is the budget of the State fund for railway transport that next year will be provided with the amount of 90,800 billion Crowns.
The agenda of enterprise and innovation must serve to entrepreneurs and businesses to the provision of resources in the development of the business.
The companies should obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, for the industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As for the current use of the funds of the EU, the Czech Republic is among the countries newly less that use them.
Sentence of twenty years for the former President of Nicaragua, passed the Court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed on Thursday the pain of 20 years for the former President of the country, Alemán, which was condemned by the year 2003 by the embezzlement of 100 thousand million dollars (almost 1,800 billion Crowns).
In spite of this, a time later, was released from prison to go on to house arrest in their property not far from the Nicaraguan.
It is not at all clear at the moment, according to the Agency PA of that, the then head of state American between 1197 and 2002, is again behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, ileana Pérez, will depend on rather of the prison agents if they stop German to finish their punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved as German constantly money from the government to the account of a company in pánama.
This company was fictitious and has belonged, in fact, to his family and partial more cercanost.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance their campaign in the choices of the year 2001.
Thus we approved the budget.
Thus it is.
The budget of the state was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first one prepared for this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget this year was already approved with the support, because it prepared the Minister it and itself could not afford to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, approved calmly the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and the departure of the budget, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but in it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of comunicacón and for that reason they devote a special attention.
The political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The budgets of the State of the governments of the Social Democrats suffered three shortcomings that for this year 2008, it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the obligatory laws, so-called as expenses of the leaders who are not only the pensions but also the social benefits that last year were already approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of and.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third line is the deficit of public funding, as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
In spite of that, the greater the risk is not found in the deficit of the budget of the State.
This is a public and under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money of the taxes, rates and credits of the banks, often expressed, meaningless, with the obligations which indebted disproportionate to its town councils.
In recent years, were able to pay these debts, by means of the sell-off of energy actions and other networks of development that it received from the state and the privatization.
At the moment they do not include this resource.
If we rely only on the facts verified and official, we discover that:
Our economy, because some years ago, passed by way of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which boasts.
This was the occasion for that his government put order to the finances of the State.
However, instead of that state continued getting into debt.
The rest of excluding some countries, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved a lot more reasonably that our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
For that reason the social massive programs are not necessary that, unfortunately, in recent years there with gigantic measures.
And even if they manage to eliminate the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if brief does not change the retirement age and the reform of the pensions then really will be the end of any policy in this country, and it that it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern transformed into civil servants, distributors of the greater part of the money of the taxes for the retirement and social services.
For that reason, the budget this year cannot be a revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the expenses of the leaders.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not wasted in the last ten years, which could.
We did not want that politicians who govern only converted into civil servants for that reason we must be patient and to grant this weak coalition government, which takes account of the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining of taxes and the rates, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced budget of the State.

The banks to want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks, British Swiss and Canadian decided to fight together against the crisis of the financial market.
In the monetary marked it will receive more than one hundred thousand million dollars through tenders.
In these tenders banks auction interest rates by which they are capable of giving money.
For example, the American fed will send to tender forty thousand million dollars, and other twenty-four thousand million will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Swiss.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of the different States come to an agreement in this process coordinated to protect and to diminish the consequences of the financial crisis.
"this step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is to say, the continuous growth of the shortage of free capital that banks might give" wrote in his report for the customers, Bernard baumohl of the company economic outlook group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks will probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65% to 50% added in his report.
The banks have already spent 60 billion in outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Economists wait still billions in losses.
"the central banks should really have fear which it expects still when they decided to take this step," said the chief economist of ABN AMRO, kieran Davies.
"seems to be that the situation is really bad added.
The central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and because it will have to give more expensive to its customers.
This would reduce the consumption and sends to the American economy in recession with different impacts on the growth of the world.
The central banks so decided, who did not manage to reduce the so-called tariff libor, tariff quarrels London that are used for the loan of money in the market.
This means that the banks feared constantly to lend money, even when the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain reduced during the autumn its interest rates several times.
"will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," said the Agency Reuters, Greg salvaggio of the company Tempus consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to turning the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem that is the fall of the property market in the USA.
Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
The global climatic change affects above all to the developing countries.
The president Václav Klaus expressed again with regard to the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now with the closure of the UN International Conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book, not Green planet, commented that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only to the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that are used and the reality.
"There debates as soon as they are structured, are fireworks of words, substituting the solution to the current problems" Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book underlined that this subject is very important for it, and that it therefore is interested.
It also expressed his delight to discover its book translated into German because, as he said "often only I meet the caricature of my ideas".
Now the interested can be reported on their mixed views.
Klaus reminded that it is not a climatologist but that has, in its opinion, sufficient supposed to write a book as this one.
He is, with the capacity to continue and to judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics, and it is also an economist.
At the time of the closure its thought that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are normal, that on the heating of the planet, there is an agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, not represent possible disasters and that the attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and unacceptable.
As well as the man with the totalitarianism he regards as unacceptable to impose the opinions of others, what it feels like a dangerous form of limiting the freedom of the others.
The questions of the present repeatedly told that it is not "against the reasonable defenders of the environment but against the ecological militants who do not take into consideration the ratio between costs and benefits.
On the same subject spoke Klaus in Vienna two months in the institute Hayek.

Polívka lost the Kingdom of walachei
Bolek polívka lost the row about the Kingdom of walachei.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the Kingdom of walachei but was created for many years by Tomás harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka was not presented today to the view orally.
According to his lawyer the cause has probably not finished and his client will recur.
"the lawsuit consists in that the man who harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of bolek polívka" said after the process, the lawyer of polívka.
For him, before the words Kingdom of walachei, to everyone comes the image of a player and funny.
The same idea has also.
"We take after us some ten years of work.
Pursuit of money and invention of activities ".
For him, the cause of the fight is the money.
"after years I have noticed that the project is a success and that it will also be able to receive something.
They want to live as parasites our work added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, the Kingdom of walachei was used for polívka in its programme of television.
In 1993 was crowned by the radoslav brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of facing towards the creation of a kingdom.
A few years later to harabiš happened to publish the passport of the Kingdom of walachei.
From this comic origin was a business and a lucrative business activity which harabiš created after the Kingdom of walachei society.
In 1997, polívka agreed in the use of its name and firm in the passports and even offered to their owners discounts to the vistantes of his farm and attending to its shows.
Who will sit in the throne?
The judge today also found that harabiš only used a simple idea that polívka made public in the setting for its own benefit business.
"It is clear that bolek polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of walachei" said the judge.
Added however that, in the spirit of the project is harabiš and his team which is dedicated to it completely.
The collaboration between the today divided, continued until the year 2000 when harabiš organized the official in vsetín.
From that moment started to occur conflicts between polívka and harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, elected by always".
The main role in the Kingdom, through harabiš resulted in the singer, as the Queen Mother.
In the year 2002, polívka presented an accusation against harabiš and its society which up to now has been rejected by the Court.
Something in it might bring in litigation, the competition for the throne with its princess, that is already preparing.
It should leave the new King.
It has not wanted to reveal it still more information and dates.
"We do not have any hurry.
It should be something like the path of King towards Moravia.
The King should be elected in a specific date.
Even the man who polívka can be presented added.
Test Peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti: overcome prejudices
To tell the truth has never liked me too peugeotu 206.
Its characteristics of course never special, the quality of the box, it manoeuvres and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now exists in the market, its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is much better.
This called sw is a little more advanced and to me, because I only have to think best.
When I proved the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, complained to me, for example, of the space of the family in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of minibus means in this respect, that I am not going to suffer in the face of the two metres in length.
Flying by the world
Step by the Interior one not to repeat it too.
It is a question of an elegant design, where the only shortcoming is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would value more the invention of design, although the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times in which we were complaining of short seats and supports.
It also unlike the 206 model, the direction side has improved considerably.
And the space, and here we can feel how the measures of the body have grown.
In the minibus eliminates the mentioned shortage of space in the head.
The trunk baggage
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I must value as very accessible (thanks to the rear large door) and a well distributed storage.
The dead are equipped with rubber strap that mean an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can be spread to the point of holding objects.
But let's stay in store.
According to the stage, in basic state has a capacity of 428 liters which in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the mouthpiece of the same type more sold in the Czech Republic, the Skoda combi.
If we compare the 207 sw with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we found out that the Peugeot remains behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
Of holidays abroad or placing the small car of the child its value is critical.
But if I have to comment on something positive, then I should mention the floor that remains quite plan after breaking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four courses
Our automobile was equipped with a encedido of injection of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 L. and a force of 88 KW.
To tell the truth, and that is as it should look like a 1600 that underestimated the relative five doors.
It is silent, consumes shortly, and above all, it has impulse.
If we compare it with the period of Skoda then that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was blocked by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices answer
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have made a vehicle equipped elegant and with a very good engine.
The basic price of car with firing of injection of 1400 by 329,900 crown, still can.
Our aggregates put from 410,900 crown, which is already too much.
The type tested already reaches another crowns.
Only that still airbag in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic, rear windows automated...
That is to say, the car with all of all, costs 531,900 crowns.
It is a lot, but has the complements the equipment in the fabia and come to a quite similar number.
Now, since it only remains to be decided by which of the two marks.
The Slovak students are not integrated in the English schools
In the English schools are present children of countries of Eastern Europe, and for that reason, the locals fear further changes in the schools.
The integration of the Europeans of this so far only brings a series of problems.
Even the British schools register those cases where the conflicts between migrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of Eastern Europe in the British schools is very well illustrated in the city of Kent where they begin to grow the conflicts between the indigenous and the Slovak emigrants.
Discussions, estorsión and quarrels among students have already reached even the fathers themselves.
The situation has reached so far that the police of chatmam arrested a Slovakian woman who was giving sticks to a student of ten years with a green.
In its defence said that she was insulting to his son with insults of racist tone.
The police had to act also after an attack of two minor girls against a Slovakian emigrant.
The girls they with racist insults and threw.
"when we went home, a boy approached towards us the bus stop and started to spit to us.
When I told him that we should leave it made the gesture send apples and pears, and then be lowered the trousers and showed its bottom "described another unpleasant incident to the times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are of both sides.
One of the natives even appointed to the conflict with the emigrants of this Europe as the fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned previously, show us as the environment in the English schools starts to be fairly tense.
In Great Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for employment reasons.
Approximately some 30,000 Slovak students attend the English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything that expect of their holidays may come to comply, provided that choosing correctly.
Beaches and golden, large waves or a calm sea as a pond.
The palm trees and all including with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, frozen or various cocteles.
Kitesurfing, Golf and roulette.
In the island of the Caribbean Sea can find all this and much more.
Only in an island is still much more and that island is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful of all the islands of the great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
The Havana became store and port of burden of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and led to Europe.
And then came the American period.
The national hotel grew at the end of the year 20.
It was ordered to build one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that there was of criminality in the USA (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among its guests were, among other
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings rose, by wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in 50 years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco Paula, next to Havana, and in cojimar had its yacht.
In the walls of the bodeguita of the left their companies the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians of all America.
And today?
In the walls of the bodeguita habanense you can also leave their autograph.
In the bar of expensive national hotel the cocktail according to their wishes.
And these cars already of worship of the fifties, until today continue working for the Havana, because those lada and Fiat that were already some time ago have rusted between these humid and salty winds.
Even though the Havana, especially the old is deteriorating dramatically, does not exist in the vicinity so many wonderful monuments as there.
Elsewhere in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Due to the fact that tourism brings so much money necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels, not only in Havana, but also in the dock, at the expense of the province of holguín and in small islands as key, key Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world, and that is highly valued by the lovers of rail.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories for narrow in steam engines or electrical.
Its garages for dozens of years not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose models brothers in other parts of the world, only to be found in museums.
Where to go?
The more known to the majority of the vistantes does not change.
And for that reason, it is not necessary to speak more of the Havana dry.
Perhaps, only to remember that in the already mentioned property of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, must not leave to visit it.
The valley of vineyards is the most corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation which grows on grounds of rock.
Heaps, rock and rocks of raised the falls in the valley, and in its caves is fertile land, thanks to which it formed which hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where they are cultivated, probably, the tobacco of greater quality in Cuba.
Visiting some of the factories of pure can meet its final product.
Perhaps someone seem interesting that there was rolled the Chilean part of the series, the major Zeman.
Trinity
City of old ancestry was founded not long after the Spanish colonizing the island.
Slavery and the sugar brought fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the construction in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French colonists come later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinity, between the sea and the mountain range of escambray, is such a remote place that still in 50 years of the last century was not road that joined with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped to remain outside the rest.
Nothing new is built, and for that reason, either, nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have where they live.
If you have more time to be in trinity that a single late, it is worthwhile to know interesting places in the nearby surroundings as the beach of ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the west of Cuba, some regard as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this is already confirmed by the proper way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo should pass by discharges and mountains, as well as for a nature that hardly knows the action of the man.
This Eastern place of Cuba has been recorded as world heritage by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There do the best chocolate, in his church have the Cross of Columbus - in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later the landing) and since the hill, where was the House and that there is now a hotel with the same name, can see the mountains, and among them, the most well-known, the anvil.
Coffee, rum, pure, the main saw, the Bay of Pigs and the island of, the Tropicana night club, the boss of Cuba, the Virgin of charity of copper, the witchcraft, African religion that the descendants of those slaves, all that would be able to fill many pages.
However, as he says, it is better to see some time.

The countries of NATO in Afghanistan around 40,000 soldiers of the fourth part are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allied forces have come to the same limit as far as organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly more helicopters, soldiers and experts train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and the way in which we will reach them" gates.
In a similar sense also spoke today the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am pleased to know that it is what we have on the ground and the sky in Afghanistan.

Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months the contentious issue of whether all the allies do the maximum in Afghanistan.
By passive was criticized, for example.

But they are in an area of minimum violence and the requirements of fight there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country, "said the gates.
The sun, tabloid newspaper this week called the German soldiers.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to play while our boys fight" sun wrote in a material accompanied with photographs of German soldiers playing ping-pong.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a party of rugby in the south part of Afghanistan.

History is in fact to the month of September, when this teacher asks to their pupils, of 6 / 7 years of age, to choose a name for the Teddy bear the class.
"eight names they come from the mouth of the children, as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", the director of the school Robert boulos.
Finally, after a vote in kind, 20 children of each 23 have elegigo to Mohamed as name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the prophet Muslim, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children they have carried out a book for the kind with the photo of the bear the following legend ‘ my name is Mohamed ".
The bear it - not taking any label with this name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in Sudan, needed to know well and that we never have done something that could be offensive towards a religious faith, "I only have asked the children to vote for a name", as it is only a mistake innocent ".
Opinion divided by numerous pupils of the range of school that described as "very attentive to their students" and "that never speaks of religion in class".

The astronauts, that they were the first to carry out a way out of control of the Shuttle, and then go to repair a solar panel, whose system of rotation was defective, were forced to be dedicated to the board damaged.
And it is Scott parazynski who has been elected to go to twist at the end of the 30 metres in length of remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added at the station to perform repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (walking the space) of the basket.
High, resistant, very skilful, has the very developed and the long arms.

After having inspected precisely the damage, it cut the cable and installed types of "small" in the area damaged.
The second had helped him "spacewalker" that had been kept near the air, and of the Interior, by other astronauts as Peggy whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool used, a minicane hockey surrounded with insulator to avoid electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundreds of volts, has been conceived and "bungled" for the astronauts board of the station.
A time finished the operation, Scott parazynski waited for the panel to be completely opened before making the inventory of its instruments and return to the interior of the station.

The choice of the status quo
No wonder the Sunday, to the removal of the ballot box: the Russians are going to decide en masse for the party of President poutine, United Russia.
Confirming its quest for stability, even to the authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
In three days of the parliamentary elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin directs today to the electorate a message televised on the public chains, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
What does it as leader of the list for the party pro-Kremlin United Russia, whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything receiving the foreign ambassadors, pleased with giving a new burden against the West, accused of interference - its subject of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish honest, more open and more transparent, elections without incidents, added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Denounce a campaign stained by pressures.
The Communist leader guennadi ziouganov says that there is no "had never so dirty elections, even at the time of eltsin".
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the former world champion of check Garry Kasparov, condemned to five days of prison for illegal demonstration, the visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"the Russian kept the mentality of the Homo sovieticus"
Behind these legislative elections without surprise is outlined two much more open questions:
What will happen to poutine to the Presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday by the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March of 2008; the candidates have to 23 cause to know.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot ask for the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful party United Russia that elegería the government and the President?
Be that as it may, the legislative elections and the presidential, power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"the Russian kept the mentality of the Homo sovieticus, do not feel owners of their destiny", it considers the sociologist lev goudkov, the director of the Centre independent.
The historian Nikolaï kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, further: civil society was postponed in this area five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the Community delayed the formation of self-interest.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "poutine re-established the model of a state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism, has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief, Maria lipman estimates, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign by own willingness to the personal responsibility of those who briefly had proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"for which reflect?"
The phenomenon is all the social layers, including the world of the matters.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) to direct the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the nineties.
The opinion prefers the stability.
In the name of the Russians did not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion Tamara tcherednitchenko, Professor of age of 54 years: "Why reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why replace? "

The former Minister of Defence José bond has accepted the offer of the President of the government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist party by Toledo for the next general election and be President of Congress, in the case of the Socialists gain the general elections.
Thus we have announced in the press conference the Secretary of the organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, white, and the proper bond, after the meeting that it has supported this noon in the Federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the supply to the former Minister for "it is important to include the best" in political life and bond "is among the best".
In addition, it has noted that "Yes it seems that the political will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on 15 November its decision not to be presented to the next general election and to abandon his career in the active policy to be dedicated to fight against climate change in the university area.

Similarly, it has had the words of praise for its current President, Manuel Marín, and their "good", and it has not wanted to see already dealing with his position does not fall in which, as he has pointed out, their opponents would be able to see it as "dominance."
Climatic advertising
Given that the movement against climate change submits persecution both to the sceptical ones of their forecasts as to which they give priority to other social and political battles, is obliged to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is Prime Minister as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of the Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a new contract with the world ".
This approach obliges it to explain why the action or inaction, of his government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are the people in charge of the breach, in which sectors has taken place, and why its government, that of the contract with the planet, has not prevented.
In addition, it requires to explain to the Spanish with the maximum clarity what are the measures that it is going to take to stop climate change.

That is to say, who will be sacrificed, and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been or will be these explanations.
Precisely because it is a question of being sacrificed and pay.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the cent of the petrol suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed so dangerous electorally Zapatero that has been quick to deny it.
That is to say, that it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, the man who so useful for the election campaigns that neither speaks and denounce nor demands, but adorns the and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited to be a merely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move in bicycle or freshen up with the range.

What I need insurance?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, means an important cost that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, seniority of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure that the use of this one, among others.
The car is only the beginning.
And the fact is that, to choose the right of car insurance is even more difficult to choose the vehicle model.
In the first place, there is to be clear about what we are talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in a contract of insurance, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium agreed to change that hold responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, sex, seniority of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure that the use that him this, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that more likely to have an accident, greater quota to pay.
It is for this reason that both the biggest of 25 as women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics reflect that have a lower rate of accident due to his prudence.
Likewise, making use of the counts, the companies have come to the conclusion that the married people tend to have fewer accidents that the single drivers.
That is the use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with that in the probability of having any kind of mishap.
To increase the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that the insurance companies have in mind at the moment of establishing the price of the premium.
It is for that reason that the driver has to study the situation well to choose that certain of car that best suits their profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables at the moment to choose one or other type of insurance, so that this, in addition to being adapted to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
The young people under 25 years are with various objections to the time of hiring an insurance at a reasonable price, as are the limited experience in leadership and the antiquity of the card.
Although the ideal to be insured well is a sure, there are other economic options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole risk with exemption, so that they obtain the coverage of an insurance to any risk but at a price more feasible.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the accident.
"the hand of the amount of the catastrophe that contributes to the client will in terms of the value of the premium, that it will be higher the lower the amount", it specifies Luis Noguera, chief in Spain of first Europe, mediator insurance online.
The other option is an insurance extended to third parties, so that the customer is assured the protection in the face of damage caused to third parties, although not in the face of the caused in its own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are less than 25 years he tries to be careful and to prevent accidents as much as possible, since this will result in the advantage, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this base rate.
"the advantages and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company has been a good year can be allowed to increase the advantages, "clarifies walnut tree.
The Gaza strip of the last 25 years, drivers have easier to hire insurance, since the index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the more it is to use any risk with tax exemption.
"normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of using in an accident, and even at the time of the leadership, it ensures the director in Spain of the European company, which adds that the majority of the accidents take place in the second year of conduct, once passed since the 'fear of novice.'
However, if the customer is married but do not yet have children is preferable to negotiate an insurance, provided their economic situation allows, of course.
For its part, the marriages with children are considered by the insurance companies and the public with smaller index, so that the extra charges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one to any risk with exemption - being able to be this 300 Euros), or, when it had a high level of increase, one to third parties extended from the third year of the life of the vehicle.
"to carry out a more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a number of major exemption", sentences Luis walnut tree.
For the pensioners a certain to any risk with exemption (being this of 150 euro), or one to third-party insurance when they have a high level of increase.
It has to be said that the automobile insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important cost, which is why it is fundamental to study adequately the sure that we need more according to our personal situation.
The Celtic search in Milan, a point that is worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic moderate this Tuesday in San siro in search of the point that they needed to achieve their respective targets in the closing of the pool of the 'champions', since the Italians uses to be the first and the Scots to declare their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified in the fifth day its happens with a tie in Portugal, whereas the Celtic has nine other points, but it still needs to make sure that the shakhtar, with six, and that is the benfica, which has four, does not move forward.
These two parties of the group D is played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, since the Milan has to dispute the world of clubs in Japan, where he the day 13 in semifinals in search of a seat for the end of the 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the deadlock in the Giuseppe meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out to by a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that gaining would first and a better one foot in it.
The set of Gordon strachan could serve even a defeat for qualify if the shakhtar did not win, but they will not be able to trust because equality of nine points it happens is for the Ukrainians, who lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct sorrow.
Thus, the milanistas will try to it the night to the Scots, that trust in getting on for the second time in the Champions League restructured and consecutive form, that they were defeated precisely in this round the last campaign with a goal of kaka in the extension () After 0-0 of departure.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the shakhtar to that only costs the victory, in the case of the Celtic loses, so as to put in to continue in the UEFA.
And the fact is that the benfica, in spite of being late and without options to continue in the European competition, could reach the third square with a victory, with which would play the UEFA.

New fears on the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute for the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that affect the export of fuel to Western Europe on the part of Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, by which each close contact between the two nations, is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher rates of transit.
A dispute this last year, reduce the provisions to the States of the EU.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State, the owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that should pay Ukraine by the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that it will receive more to Ukraine, since this has committed itself to pay 50% extra in 2008 for gas that comes from the one Turkmenistan.
The analysts say that it could be that Ukraine pays a 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important traffic for the gas during the talks," said the Minister of Economics Anatoly kinakh to Reuters news agency.
"the changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of the rates of traffic [towards Western Europe] via Ukraine.
The last great for the gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the supply of the EU.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own with gas supply of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
The NHS "should prove to foreign workers"
The Scottish needs to control the records of criminal records of the employees of outside of Europe, a guard said.
The recommendation of the General Auditor Robert Black came after that it proved that a doctor abroad in connection with the attack at the airport of Glasgow, in June.
Black also showed its concern that the Scottish does not have exact idea of the amount of foreign staff that counts.
However, his report indicated that other controls were carried out correctly through a sample of five authorities of health.
The General Auditor checked the amount of foreign staff hired out of the European economic area, as a result of the attacks in the airport in Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a doctor's Iraqi hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested in the airport after hitting jeep in the doors of the airport terminal.
It was one of the three doctors who acted in the old bailey by video conference in October, accused in relation to the alleged offences with car bomb in the United Kingdom.
The NHS hopes to carry out the controls of pre to the candidates, to ensure that they comply with the qualifications, the experience and the authorization for work in the United Kingdom.
Although the meeting of health of Scotland uses "disclosure Scotland" to carry out the controls of criminal records, the Agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information out of Great Britain.
The report of the General Auditor recommends, among other measures, that the meetings should be provided with the guidance of the criminal records Bureau, that aid to the employers with the penal controls in many countries out of Great Britain.
"although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review", the report says.
Black declares that the Scottish has a high level of compliance of their own employment policies, but it reads: "our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that it has the necessary information on the number of foreign staff of the NHS."
The President of the bma Scotland, Dr Peter Terry said that it was "very unlikely that the controls can identify potential employees of the NHS that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
The report suggests that the controls function in the NHS Scotland but it is not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made ", explained.
The Scottish authorities of health declare that at present they are provided with 1,161 foreign people, the majority of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because the meetings have problems in identifying what are the employees who are provided with indefinite authorizations of residence.
The research also found that the procedures of checking established by the authorities of the NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were complying with widely.
This includes the permission, passport control of work and control of qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently revising the policy and guidance of pre-employment of foreigners in the.
The Secretary of health, Nicola sturgeon, states: "It had a great interest that this work was carried out as a result of the terrorist attack of the airport in Glasgow.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with the meetings of health, they would be able to consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the updating of the guidelines of control for all the working parties - including the foreigners which anticipated to publish the next month.

The state television of the biggest provider of oil in the world he said that one of the cells was planning the smuggling of missiles.
Supporters of Al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an installation in the province of this, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of cash to protect the facilities of abqaiq, the largest oil plant of the world, after an attack unsuccessful of Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a declaration of the Minister of the Interior, said that the Saudi 18 of the brave belong to a cell headed by an "expert in launching of missiles", that has entered the country.
The Minister said that the militants had planned entry for smuggling of eight bullets to the country.

The climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the earth
Venus could have been a time an appropriate place for life, declared scientific yesterday.
The data of a European spaceship in orbit showed the world more resemblance to a of the land of what had previously been observed.
Venus is the planet more closely to the land.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar Venus, although it is slightly nearer to the sun.
Millions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions to which made of the land a habitable planet, the scientists believe now.
But the effects of carbon dioxide, and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by the solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus at a very different kind of development.
Today, the world has not water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to lead and it is being eroded by the winds and storms rays.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus express, who has studied the planet for a year, offers a picture of how the land could develop disastrous changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, the department of physics of the Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus express, states: "It is clarified cause climate in Venus is so different from that of the land, when they are so similar planets.
"our new information make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as the land, possibly with an inhabitable millions of years."
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, to declare is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Hungarian and Slovak police.
Portavos police declared that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash would not be able to confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said that it might have been sold by 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It still remains open
Mitt apologetic says that it is not worth the presidential candidates answer the questions of a monkey of snow.
However, the Republican candidates for the Presidency possibly agree to hold a debate in youtube, in which the ordinary voters record questions on video, and they send them to its spread among the candidates.
None of the questions put forward in the evening of Wednesday 28 November were more ridiculous that the snow monkey that asked the Democrats about the climatic warming in the debate of the republican party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected very much of the State of the Republican Party facing the choices of the next year.
No one knows exactly how the producers of the CNN, to co-sponsor the debate, chose the videos of youtube to show the candidates to applicants.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters that the ideas that when they were listening to them: the issuers noted peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The exchanges of words more at night occurred between rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. apologetic, which has been a leader in the crucial surveys of iowa and new Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of apologetic since it was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
Attacked Mr. apologetic, accusing the former of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in their home.
Both responded aggressive when they asked if any candidate would be able to support a "Amnesty" (allowing the illegal to normalize their situation and the possibility of obtaining the citizenship).
The smaller candidates as Duncan hunter, a congressman, and Tom tancredo, a congressman of red, achieved agreement on the subject.
Neither has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share points of view: the increase of the monitoring at the borders, intolerance with the illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of the toxic toys of China and other concerns on the outside, aid to the Republicans to forget, or to diminish, the divisions between the liberals and conservatives Christians.
But the debate was transformed into discomfort when other topics appeared.
Mr. guiliani asked why it had supported the control of weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. apologetic debated about whether the immersion in water should be considered to be a torture.
A person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr. Giuliani to run into the position of that while the Bible it was his book, do not believe literally in the history of the jonás and whale.
Another person asked Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now, against all expectations, in the first place in the most recent survey of iowa, thanks to its Christian conservatism of long said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was pressured to respond if Jesus would be for the laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent as to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. huckabee increases in iowa, coincidentally with the campaigns of collection of funds of the liberal rum Paul, and its declarations of the heated debate on Wednesday.
The two of them have come from the heart, because the two wings of the party did not reach agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate United convincingly to the early party and with a winning message on the greatness of America, to satisfy both wings of the party.
This time the match is divided, and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in that sinking; but equally emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
Do not seem to have been sold influences, nor is exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, not absorbed of fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the party of English Labour government, of more than 650,000 pounds sterling (1.3 billion), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party not to denounce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided to call a choice, insulting stupidly the British intelligence declaring that the opinion polls does not influence in its decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of that, as vince calbe, the Liberal Democrat heads with increasing, because it feared Mr. Brown has happened to be Stalin to be Mr. bean.
The rescue of northern rock, a bank in problems, demonstrated the weakness and the poverty of opinion in times of crisis.
The bad proposals to change the code of taxes has put the business groups, together, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million of personal data that revealed a botched job administrative unimaginable.
A general of distant initiated a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in the military spending: to be ministers of the armed forces is claimed, a part-time work.
They are now the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General labour (and previous accomplice) has already resigned.
All of this means that Mr. brown walk irrevocable towards the way forward.
Governments can come to a point of afterwards that they are unable to govern.
The people do not believe them as politicians, but usually suspend its incredulity when a new set assumes the control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister does not possible to improve things, not to reduce a lot of time, this suspension is more: the civil servants begin to fail; the cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks bad news; and the government is put on the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, the position of brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders cannot defend arguing that is new.
Although he wanted to Tony Blair, it was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of the northern rock and the authority registration tax, they are related to the decisions that brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even when it is not directly wrapped in the misfortunes of blairish or "effective for Members, the investigation of the financing of political parties - the voters can assume that if it is.
However, the situation of Mr. Brown is not as bad as it sounds.
The is not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. bean, nobody has died, nor has it been defrauded directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the trends naturally of Mr. brown have always promised: a brutal and reliable government.
The new political scandal of the donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, that compares its donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not want to public recognition for its benevolence.
Perhaps this is so, but the decision not to take it.
The laws against the anonymity for the great political taxpayers is clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know about the agreement of Mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously it will face to mendlesohn, head of the collection of funds that it was asked about the donations in October.
But brown until now is not meant: there is nothing suggests that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of the payments was made that it took control of the office in June.
Up to now the Prime Minister has made half of the work.
It has been quick in condemning his party to break the law, but it is diluted in the taking of decisions by a familiar subject, a Commission of Inquiry on the matter, to a certain extent, by a judge, and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. brown should do, as well as to find a permanent and independent for the Commission for standards in public life, since it has not been one for six months, and in addition it must press for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a great deal of labour cooperative with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation that has with the unions bitter measures for a partisan as Mr. Brown.
But it must face some facts partisan.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; it has two years to make voters; and the only way that it can move to the victory is acting with an impeccable integrity and a strong competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of mortgages subprioritizes is infecting the American market of the credit cards?
When there are blood in the water, it is natural that a few numbers touched around.
Now that the American market of the House is in crisis, the predators have their eyes put on the market of the area of credit cards.
In goldman Sachs analysts estimate that the losses in credit cards can come to 99 billion if the crisis of mortgages subprime infected other forms of consumption credits.
Signs of infection already seen.
There is an increase in both the positions of cards as in the rates of crime, that the proportion of the balances that have not been or that they have more than 30 days delay respectively.
Hsbc announced last month that has taken 1.4 million position in its business of financing the American consumer, in part due to the weakness of the borrowers of cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
The slowness and crime are in low levels.
According to moody 's, an agency of qualification, the third quarter crime rate of 3,89% was almost a percentage point under the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the law of the failure of the American people (2005) gave rise to a sharp decline in the applications of failure, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of dilatoriness) would be growing again, or it can happen that the conditions for the borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also brings solid rates of pay, which shows how much of their debts paid by consumers every month.
And the confidence in the credit cards and the values endorsed by assets is quite firm, in spite of the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis moroney of towergroup, a firm researcher, predicts that the volumes of emissions for the year 2007 will be around 25% higher than in the past year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between the subprime mortgages and the market of the credit cards certainly exists: consumers like to charge the debts to the credit cards that the credit organizations are expiring.
But the issuing of the credit card look more the flow of liquidity that the values assets, so that prices fall do not necessarily a change in the ability of the creditor borrowers.
Even they can work to the north.
The incentives for consumers continue paying off the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and, as a result, the payment of the debt of the card rises in the list of priorities.
The issuing of cards can also to respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that lenders mortgage interest rates, changing or altering balances creditors.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid of assets.
"We are not going to wake up one day and evaluate all the loans again," says Gary perlin, head of capital finance one.
If a sudden infection of subprime into the market of the credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a sustained reduction are much more realistic.
If the prices of homes are lower and a credit crunch push to America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a future more severe.
It is necessary to continue to keep these numbers.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to court for his responsibility in the fraud with the previous leader of the financial office of Enron, Andrew fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven positions of fraud because they were colluded with fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 for rich at the expense of the employees.
They were sent to opinion in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing werlein jr of district U.S, each one was sentenced as guilty of colución in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich natwest, a unit of the Scottish group plc in the Royal bank, became famous cause in Great Britain by the extradition procedures that lasted two years.

Initially, the charges against the bankers were to be alerted in 2002 fastow that was a target of a governmental research on the collapse of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - "natwest three" - claims that came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent plan with fastow and his assistant over this, Michael kopper.
Greenwich natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a society of Enron controlled by fastow, that was the creator of a myriad of cheating in Enron, which helped to its spiral decline in failure.
In 2002, the Bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew that he would in rise.
A company under the control of kopper bought the interest of bank of the subsidiary in $1 million dollars.
The bankers paid to kopper dollars by interests in this company.
According to the accusation, fastow represented falsely Enron, since the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich natwest by its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers received millions, while fastow, kopper and other received near 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, fastow was sentenced guilty by two positions of conspiracy on the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a sentence of 6 years in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years, and a month in texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars needed to live in the United States as the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the seven bigger companies of the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of tricks in the accounting, would not be able to hide the debt of successful million or make it its business to fail.
The collapse did lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in stock market and more than two million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the Chief Executive, Jeffrey culprits were entrusted the years spent by their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a condemnation of more than 24 years.
The condemnation of lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.

Surgery "ducks" could be the cause of death in New Jersey
It was the previous day in thanksgiving when Ronald livingston looked through the window of the "a bit healthier" and saw how an ambulance rose by white cod, two doors further down in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, a car of the patrol the police.
And after another.
"then I saw raising the ambulance", Mr said. Livingston, of the Supervisor, this day Wednesday.
"there was when I know that someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga stream, assistant of the director of the Department of the police of Newark.
Now the researchers are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by a plastic surgeon, that is not yet identified by the police, but that work in the home of 212 of the AV. West Scott.
The authorities still does not determine what caused the death of Mrs. stream, but hope to the test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks; this will help to resolve the mysterious death that is ashamed at the top lines of the police of Newark.
The lady stream had been an assistant of the director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and their voice was familiar to many in the department.
"it was loyal, working and tenacious", says Mr. McCarthy on stream in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

It is hoped that the Federal Reserve will cut the rates to raise the stock market
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve to calm the credit conditions with cuts in interest rates, which increased with the soothing comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The markets are loose in London, New York and across Europe that Donald kohn, number two of Ben bernanke, President of the reserve, declared that the stewards of politics must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets in the middle of increasing samples of markets of credit, Mr. kohn said that the recent turmoil was "invested by the progress in the market at the end of September and during October.
If it was the upward trend, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and businesses, said kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital in the markets of the environment and to make cuts of the type of interest, to stabilize the conditions of the loan.
The remarks also helped to defuse Wall Street in the middle of the bad news for the economy of the United States, as the sales of houses that reach the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil was highlighted by a warning to bear stearns, Investment Bank that will 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4% of its entire labour, in a global reduction of costs in order to compensate for the loss of their investments in the mortgages priority of the United States.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts to go to London, where the bank uses 1,500 people.
In New York, the average industrial Dow Jones raised in 331 points, or 2.55%, at the end 13.289.40, whereas the extensive index s & P 500 raised a%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165,5 points, or to 2.7%, at the end to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of the leading companies in Great Britain.

The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds in the stock markets in London, they strained the credibility and the rates of the loans to three months "libor" between the British banks, meant the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a constant increase from 12 November.
Britain takes the demands of owais Shah and ravi bopara
Here there are two dilemmas, each one as difficult as the other.
Who should strike at No 6 by England in this weekend, owais Shah or ravi bopara?
And it is no less important in the face of the first test on Sri Lanka, who should decide?
The second question is relevant because David graveney, the President of the team that is on loan to this particular title at least, is here to help Peter moores, the coach, and to Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, the director of the United Kingdom, is beginning to fill out to be converted into national selector, and if not, in one part time.
That did not obtain the sixth place of BAT will be unfortunate, but the life often it is unfair and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw which makes a man at the top of their profession, while another never goes beyond the low level, sometimes for lack of luck than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, since judgments are required which always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for that bopara up?
Is it right for Shah if he does?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, John or "," banerjee, two tubby young executives with good grades and who know well the business, had to be promoted to the board: there is only place for one of them.
Who should say what a good level for a player of cricket, unless they give the occasion to sink or swim to the next?
The figures naturally have a major influence on the decisions, but it also have opportunities.
Within a team, a player of cricket has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time to take a wicket and a batter to obtain opportunities to change the order if it wants to have an impact as player some day.
But to catch the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many improved the last season, for example, James Anderson, that probably plays in the first test even if Stephen harmison testifies to fit and bowls as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 of the first class in 33 careers for each one to gain a place.
Chris tremlett took only 29 on average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or bopara at the stage of asgiriya can be only a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make the career of a man, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth played in each test, and did so well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but was Paul collingwood, fighting to be established at the same time, who came to become a major player, and in spite of noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, can be still underestimated.
The likelihood is that graveney, Vaughan and moores, after a discussion in the meeting today in the stage of asgiriya, will continue its instincts of conservation and favor greater experience of Shah by on the exhuberancia of the young.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah is his brilliant and valuable proof of debut of principles of 88 in Mumbai, 32 hundreds of first class as opposed to only 6 of bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and it is excellent antedecentes against the spin Bowling.
But Shah made only ten careers in its two shifts in May against West Indians in the test in lords, his home as middlesex player, and that caused the immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed its place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken of his something to him that in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie of vivre in swords.
It is lit by anything in the field of cricket and its attitude was summed up as when overturned his vehicle in an exhibition for the sponsor of cars of England, Volkswagen.
Suffered wounds of minor importance and, presumably a shock, but the first thing that did was to take his Vodafone (client, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his team who looked at the distance, to say: "you saw with excitement that".
Bopara is the best player, including its slippery pass to have effects on their moves that seem to satisfy, for BATs with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing, to choose the best time, another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
My inclination would give to bopara its opportunity, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as they suggest the leaves of tea, he is the one who is here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees of Syria started to come to Baghdad yesterday, expelling the ones that remained without effective, without extensions of the visa and who hoped that the city to return to normality.
Some even had returned to fight against the militants who drove them out of their homes.
In the season of buses of mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of government consisted of a dozen or so of buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, which had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria that they killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-qubaisi, doctor.
"I returned today by what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what happened in Baghdad, and that is surely now".
"say that the army of mahdi left of killing people", it declares, referring to the Shi'ite militia of religious militant cleric moqtada al-sadr, who arranged its troops a momentary cease.
Qassim to the atwani, Shiite 38 years and teacher in the area of amariyah, returned to his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria, since the regime does not want the Iraqis working in his country.
Their Shiite in amariyah called by telephone, to say that an ally of the United States has helped to remove Al-Qaeda outside its bastion the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers of Jordan was the leader of a tribe Shiite and who had been driven from his home in sleikh in the north of Baghdad, for an attack of grenades, after which urged the citizens to get up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that it had begun a militia anti in sleikh and that it needed my support and that of my colleagues.
For that reason I have returned today, declared sabaah obeidi, 62.
Many said to be swayed by the growing calm in the capital from the troops of the groups of "citizens concerned", armed and working in cooperation with the soldiers of the USA to defend their local communities.
But many people declared to be returned by the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in the last few years.
Salaam al-samarrai, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the ones, that nouri, Prime Minister, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on visas for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country because of the sectarian bands of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"I cannot believe in a government which supports the criminals who to my home after that left".
Part of the reason of the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis, have been expelled from the areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees does arise again the sectarian tensions and starts the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in the vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its high schools.
As in any country, the sarlandeses only lack an educational field.
"I explained yesterday by the fiftieth time to not sarlandés that we are not franseses" - this was the motorcycle ironic on themselves of the smallest federal State for its cencuentenario.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a greater role in the educational system of Sarre that in a study of the Institute of the German economy (iw) called "bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, the high schools by tradition have good relations with those countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was melted in 1948 by thefranseses.
Up to now the students can finish their university career with two or three dipolmas.
As a consequence, for the procentaje foreign students is high, of 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students originating from the Sarre is higher than the average in the high schools; many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"in the Sarre use is made of the system of the professional education", says plünnecke, experte of educational sector in the Institute of the German economy (iw).
More than five young people for their degree in the vocational school; well, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points% above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of the range of possibilities for an education is very wide.
The offer of the double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
In spite of the practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of science graduates of engineering fell to a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Sarre obliged the high schools to do more publicity for the specialities in science engineering.
"after the first study of steps, we made some reforms in the schools of general education," States a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
So the Government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
So that the children start as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "kita-jahr, this does not have any cost; in the meantime, this model also imitates the other federal.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether it has increased the performance of the students.
According to the report steps of the year 2003, the number of students backward developing student desminuyó of 29 to 20%.
But, in general, the Sarre does not improve very much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, the pupils can calculate better.
For disappointment of the sarlandeses, the report steps does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field could achieve good results.
In spite of the fact that the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbours is an obligatory subject in the secondary schools.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela, there will be another time different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez leaves to modify the schedule in the South American country postponing the clock half an hour.
At the moment it is remaining Chavez as a funny in Spain.
As it has informed the Venezuelan Official Gazette, according to the new law, the time it will take at least four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, such as the enemy of the United States, justifies its desición saying that the United States imposed in its day, the obligation to the world to change a complete hour.
In addition, the Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breach of relations with his country Colombia because of the action with the taking of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist said that do not maintain any relationship, even with the head of state or with the Colombian Government so that the Conservative Alvaro Uribe to continue being the President of Colombia.
"my dignity does not allow me to do so, it says", which is a constitutional reform which the citizens of the country must decide on Sunday in referendúm.
With this reform would be able to expand quite its power in the country.
The right of the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chavez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in that it is a matter of the release of the hostages.
The Sunday Chávez said criticizing the decision that it took Uribe has victim to Venezuela.
In Spain, there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called account sense in the country: "Why do not you?", is the sentence that have already unloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain, which was upset by the continuous interrupcciones on the part of the left-wing populists in the last Latin American Summit.
In 2007 the decline of the real wage threatens the Germans.
According to a prognosis, this year a decrease in real wage threat to the German employees in spite of a strong situation.
The experts present a great number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans böckler, the German employees should be provided in the year 2007 with a real lower than the previous year.
"the fault of that is the weak evolution of salaries, the increase of the value added tax and the tug of food prices and the energy, informed the newspaper" Bild "Gustav Horn of the Institute of macroeconomics and investigation of the economic cycles.
Also the new burdens of unemployment insurance can correspond to the employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter setinbrück said to the newspaper 'Neue ostanbrücker Zeitung that given the current situation, the intention to diminish the burden of unemployment insurance 3.3% to pass from one year to another, it is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office of work has not put again in an unpleasant situation, asking for loans and subsidies to the federal state, according to the words of a politician of the German Social-Democratic Party.
On Tuesday was made public that the rate of inflation, with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the sector of petroleum derivatives reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the land.
In spite of its atmosphere is not adequate for life, Venus is the planet more similar to the land, which until now had not presented the European sounding "Venus express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and maelstrom in the Poles, such that it also appear in winter in the land.
Three decades ago researchers had the suspicion that could be rays in Venus.
But now the European sounding has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves to the edge of the atmosphere. Cayen Venus the rays of a height of 54 kilometres of a cloud, and behind another, CRIS Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal "nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of urey-miller, the rays caused the life on earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for its part, had given the amino acids that are the basic components of the life.
In Venus is not like this: if there were life there, that it should be one of the first states of evolution, explains are Solomon of the institution Carnegie of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus cannot be life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than in the land and the surface temperatures of 500 ° C, ranging from in such a way that they can be reached temperatures below zero.
"possibly, Venus is a" diabolical "of the land, but it remains a", said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus express" is to respond to the question of why Venus, similar to the land by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
And since the 1990s were not special missions, only for research of this planet, the promotion of "venus-express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The results of the investigations that are going to be presented in many items of "nature", according to the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
This desmuestra also that the "planets have more common characteristics with the land of which we had course", that informs.
In spite of the already well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the south polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that turns faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the flows of wind in the high terrestrial atmospheres of the Poles, as it describes a team of researchers of Giuseppe piccioni of Italian Institute of special and space physics.
The second world of the solar system has the mass almost equal to the land and with its Equatorial diameter of 12 miles is almost so great.
This planet also called Star of dawn or evening star orbit around the sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus amounts to 243 days in the land.
Although Venus with their skin temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble a lot of the earth, the scientists depart from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets had piled up water in the land remained in the oceans, but in Venus dissociated in the universe.
Whereas in the land carbon dioxide had become stones of carbon, in Venus form the greater part of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the meeting of Merkel with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties on the reception of the Dalai Lama in the federal.
He criticized indirectly to the German Social-Democratic Party for his attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Horst koehler, the Federal President, worries about the reputation of Germany, and for that reason it demanded that the great coalition finished this fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.

At the same time koehler showed its understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (party of the Union demócratacristiana) in September.
"although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force for me," said koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with greater balance in meteria of foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach that received when carrying out a new policy on China.
"the Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the traditional course of the policy of a China.
China also knows, "said koehler.
Frank-walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had shown indirectly his disappointment on the reception of the Dalai Lama, and because of it was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its unworkable policy on the matter.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal caused great misunderstandings in the relations.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only to withdraw the invitation to peer steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance in Germany, but also, according to news of the "Spiegel", was the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the leader of the Chinese Government was required to the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China does not accept that the European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.
The actions and the words of the Dalai Lama showed that it is trying to divide the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes also other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances as occurred in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang schaeuble warns that disturbances as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister requires that we do everything possible so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany is not transferred to the streets.
It made up, the ones shot with rifles police: after serious disturbances carried out by young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Affairs, Wolfgang schaeuble (party of the Union demócratacristiana) fears similar tendencies in Germany.
"We must concentrate also that the social problems of our country does not take the violent form".
"that we have to take seriously," said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all the young people will not develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, the federal state and to the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said schaeuble.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"of the Summit of integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving its first fruits."
It is still early to take for granted the end of alarm.
At the same time schaeuble indicated that the suburbs Germans do not have the same problems and sociological as happens in France.
The young people carried out serious disturbances in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last evening.
In tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan kolat, the President of the Turkish community in Germany demanded greater efforts of the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the rate of unemployment among the young people of foreign origin under 25 years is located above the average.
It is necessary to take care that have more positions of vocational training.
Kolat emphasizes: "We must give a perspective to young people.
The President of the Turkish community added that in Germany, rather than in France, "there is a great social control in the families", greater than the French country.
In addition, the majority of the young people of foreign origin does not want to destroy what had built up their parents.
Kolat thinks: "But, in spite of everything, we have to be careful.
It is necessary to "to offer the opportunity to the young people of receiving more rapid a job or of vocational training."
In the meantime the night in the Parisian suburb villiers-le-bel passed in a peaceful way.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter with lights flew the territory.
The responsible authorities informed of three arrests, as well as into and burned cars.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers is dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle alliot-marie, the Interior Minister, announced that the police is going to adopt rigorous measures until it is necessary.
The night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in villiers-le-bel.
The disturbances continued night following in tolouse.
The disturbance started by a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the Office of the public prosecutor, the death of the young people was not because of the police.
In the realm of Angela wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition for the content came to his last point and that it is not necessary to wait for anything more of it.
But in what country the Chancellor really lives?
After his despairing performance, indifferent and without much contained in the general debate of the Chamber of Representatives to say: it does not live in the country that would have to be governed by it.
As far as the reproach that was made by having dedicated itself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a way to provincial and thus showed made to confirm that it does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House declared in a very clear way to all that this reproach was adapted.
It was possible to feel neither a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But, instead, Angela wolke was presented in this way: a very high politics that out in the foreign policy and is there without achieving nothing in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was praised very much to itself for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these goals must be made here in questions of climate.
In general, this way of being praised for two years, the leader of the Party of the Union has not been able to allow as much modesty.
Therefore it is involved in expressions so that a boost to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image for the pragmatic view with which to resolve the problems without leaving for the trees.
But in the realm of Angela wolke the interior problems are aparencias of little value.
The poverty of the children and the concerns for workers with low salaries?
The only thing that is dedicated to speak on this subject using subordinate clauses.
It is amazing how many times, it is wrong to speak when it is a question of the supplement to the children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It starts to run "as if it had been in an unknown territory, when it is a question of more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two favourites, rudy y mitt apologetic, made a confrontation in a heated debate of presidential Republicans of youtube and must now fear only a candidate from the outside.
From a principle the tensions between the candidates.
Mitt apologetic reproached his opponent rudy Giuliani for this to have been converted to New York "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants.
This, in turn, responded with serious reproaches: "meant that its own House was a" Port "for the illegal." Giuliani answers ex--governador of massachustes saying that he was the one who used the illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to the attacks, as up to now the group of Republicans does not have a clear, eight presidential take advantage of the debate on the CNN, above all to discredit their opponents.
The small videos of 30 seconds, requested by usarios of Internet that were sent to youtube, do not have a lot of content.
With this way of isolation leave Hitler to come to power, that was the reproach of John McCain to his opponent rum Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on withdrawing withdraw the troops from Iraq.
Apologetic also receives many criticisms by part of the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to acknowledge as torture the "," a method of examination, to leave to suffocate a person simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida shows that in the meantime the most important themes of the campaign are different, not only to the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public is always very loudly applauded when they praised the values and denying the rise of taxes.
So it is possible to do better where the weaknesses of both favourites.
At that time I was wrong, explains and asks the people and to the public of the television have been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, they do not know what to say when asked him what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
A day after its resignation as head of the army, the President was made to swear as President.
Thus the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
On Thursday pervez Musharraf, the President of Pakistan, took I swear to a second term of 5 years.
The television transmitted in direct the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf was sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
Wednesday transferred its mandate of the leader of the army to its informer ashfaq kiyani and this way accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the USA.
Eight years after seizing power with a military coup, ex-general rules for the first time the state as civil leader.
With its resignation to the position of the leader of the armed forces, Musharraf complied with the main condition of the opposition and the West.
Another demand is the aim of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to malik Muhammad qayyum, the Attorney General's Office, after I swear Musharraf is going to annul the state of emergency and will comply with the second condition of the West.
Since it was proclaimed the state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many jurists partial Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the controversial new elections of the head of the government on 6 October.
In the meantime, in an attack on a convoy of the soldiers in the region of the North, five soldiers were killed and another four were injured.
According to information from the spokesman of the army a bomb exploded in a of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the seventies continues its activity: three members of "harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As revival became a copy of "live 1974" which was written in the best time of the band.
Already in those times very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to a food caused the sensation.
Every one of them has in front of its small - yes, and above all its buttons.
In the way it is granted Dieter moebius that has 63 years and is dressed with a white shirt.
His left Michael rother, which has its portable computer and the guitar.
To the right, looking at the audience, is, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the board of controls.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them is even pace.
At times, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother to the men.
Something very exciting to excited of krautrock was the fact that the band returned to make music.
What has to be revealed here is the following: the questions exactly have shown that the name of the band echoed in the minds of the people, but it was not something special as after 32 years the public the so much.
But why Germans can also not applaud his alive legend of the seventies?
Above all because the ambiguity was always more valued in Britain and the United States that in his own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a prize of music "threw" to the members of the band 2003 of Cologne for its work of life, in the room could be seen the faces of the artists of German pop.
And when network hot chili peppers thanked the band the Düsseldorf und!, all opened up with astonishment.
Later Michael rother spent time in the stage during the concerts of net hot chili peppers as if it had been an old friend (of the band).
The ignorance in his country and the recognition abroad, they are only one thing.
It turns out to be a problem this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those days did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, we got it with thanks to the other.
Already a time moebius and roedelius had done music with the artist Conrad schnitzler and had a name, cluster, who promised much reputation.
The first in the basement of Berliner schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a company of music in duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For some time, rother had a small job in kraftwerk and worked of guitarist in the band! managed to improve the reputation of this German band that in those days it was too radical.
In 1973 rother followed the musicians of cluster in exile to forst in weserbergland.
There, in alten weserdorf, that is in ruins of the century, they were living as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological that I, where roedelius could complain of its position.
It was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, a day a song association of edge of singing in the rubbish, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name.
The first albúm was called "musik von harmonia" and the second "lux".
In spite of the fact that the music was calm and simple, the band had financial problems.
The life as the artist was not only to be known to itself.
The CD "live 1974" was recorded during a concert in griessem. Someone recalls that, in this recording almost 50 people took part.
Then rother expressed its desire to promote harmonia and to do once in a while.
For roedelius and moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother finished put in subjects and assured its existence with albums as "flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has had more success than it had.
The recording in direct of albúm in griessmer, that there is to be thanked.
Its business of music was put and end to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve as the music alive.
As the work of roedelius, also the band! again it was discovered.
The presentation as band takes place in the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the festival.
There is Julian cope, English, the old and the author of the manual "krautrock sampler".
There is also present Dr motte, the inventor of loveparade.
In this way, all influences krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super, since he was empty.
The phrase of Brian eno coupled with the special music fills the room: "this music is the only true music, it is partenece fúturo".
There are photos where it appears with producers in farm.
The history of the development of the legend appears in the projections of photos in black and white, where there are instruments with cables.
In the Fund has three veterans that began to improvise again.
Do nothing more than to set the microphones at the European Council and the battery to be able to produce some extraordinary tones with the help of the devices of effects that had built with their own hands.
At the moment the electronic music is as well as it had to be.
Three people who study in the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of barbaric, in a musical environment is, it is rumoured and in good time of emphasis was sung ",".
Krautrock since it was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
Is not the origin of the kind in the blues, but in the schools of music - can), in technologies (kraftwerk) or avoiding the artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever shouts: "68!" is also right, but now it preserves the calm.
In the stage reflects very well on what is already clear.
Where it begins and where does it music?
That can break the nerves to one or give fast moments of luck.
Richard gere only lacks most cynicism.
The two films "the party" and "moerderischer Frieden" engaged again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two do not have much conviction.
Or the concepts are set very much in actions and tirotes or two films are thrilling exciting.
Richard gere with its "the party" neither can help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, keep hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but indeed there, in the dark inside the country during the war in Bosnia, actor Richard gere was discovered again.
Finally, we lost sight to the man of the eighties, because nobody wanted to see after his nice papers and of little importance in the films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "the hunting when a hunter becomes what it" (why today the titles of the films have to be so long and absurd?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to the view: in the background, its role in the reporter war is the presentation of what could be done Richard gere, if the destiny and the industry of the cinema had not been so with him; he was a man whose times better life already happened, that as a monument to the ruin of its decline kept up to now, the greater part of his charm.
"The party", in spite of this victory, along with "moerderischer Frieden" that is the German production and will also be presented this week, are to be only a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
It is possible to relate the film "moerderischer Frieden" briefly: it is a question of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt) that want to save a Serb of the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that they also that goes with it.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the firing, although we are glad that the Serbs are not presented once more as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "quality charges 11" without highway, but in a situation of war.
In the case of "the party" can be investigated, because in reality there has never been a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another point, with another director and with other author of script (Richard shepard in two positions), the history of the American reporters in the war that is going to detect a Serbian war criminal called "Fox, probably could be a new" now ".
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: the small teams are twice to the mountain to carry out something that cannot make the army and every time it is a journey in madness.
A reason of the failure of the party "is when the start we present to Simon, he did not allow him to be simply a cynical to heart.
No, the script also anticipates a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian that are going to kill afterwards.
Then, "the party" is very far from the reality, especially when, in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive rapidly achieve what could not achieve for five years, NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of heads of the world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnians for itself in a way that is fair.
It is so badly, who want to appeal to the International Court in The Hague, based on the crimes con logic.
However, the intention of the film is, in fact, one humanprofondamente.
The movie wants to condemn the fact that and they be even free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned to pursue them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes it is good and bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this peoma is a matter of a mask of a demon Asia: "in the wrinkles of its opposite see, sharing the feelings with it, that it is hard to be bad".
In the films as "the party" there are also these demons but they demonstrate that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only in the kind of films of war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all the films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It is possible to add also that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
It is worth a rule almost always: when a star put by a region of crisis or the fields of mines, then something appears as well as "Rangoon" by Patricia arguette, "to the other side of all borders with Angelina jolie or" diamonds with Leonardo dicaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood a good film on the Holocaust, taking as an example the film "the list of Schindler".
Some films already need more time; the classics as works on the war in Vietnam "the", "now" or "full metal" in its times were not celebrated by unanimity as masterpieces.
Today, perhaps know too much on world conflicts, and therefore in our times every slaughter (massenmord) comes presented directly in two televisions at home.
And this is because the authors of the script do not have any objection - that it is necessary to be able to) in telling stories good.
"to be or not to be" or "the great dictator" were to end so good, because lubitsch and Chaplin still does not know that so bad was in fact the Nazi regime.
Perhaps it should not be a good person to make a film.
Perhaps it is necessary to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with their eyes and distant from an artist.
When I asked him on the parallels between its historical novel "dictionary of lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, replied: "that is due solely to the fact that some things never change.
The big cities will always be in danger, the men are always going to be murdered cruel and always reign the war in Yugoslavia.
Von receives in response to the negative criticism on the Olympic Games.
The Mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of the politics and the economy does not ask for the Olympic Games of the summer.
Many people want to keep on fighting for the competitions in the section of aquatic sports.
But beust recalls that it is necessary to be realistic when considering the possibilities.
Hans-joerg schmidt-trenz, the Director General of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, expressed on Wednesday this resignation as "no good for the economic location".
In the last time any other project in the big city encouraged so much motivation like the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"without this objective would not be able to maintain the political momentum, sport at the same level.
Schmidt-trenz demanded at the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application that refers to another time.
On Wednesday mayor smells von supported his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Olympic Games to the summer is not carried out until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that decides the German Federation of Olympic sports, says von in the Welt online.
He sent to the decision of the Federation of sport (sportbund) that is expected at the beginning of December, on the application of Munich for the Olympic Games the winter of 2028.
"this preference means for us that in this period of time, which up to now have until we thought 2028, from the point of view realistic will not have any opportunity".
In spite of everything, this dream did not put an end to always said von.
The Federation of sport of Hamburg (hsb) regrets the statements of von beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years, Hamburg does not want to ask for the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to remove the opportunity, if at this moment the plans are ruined," said the Wednesday Günter ploß, the director.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the declaration of the leader of the Senate, who made in a reception because of the general meeting of the German public Federation of sport to the high schools (adh).
There von designated the request from Hamburg to universiadas of 2015, not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport to the high schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The share of the German Social-Democratic Party (spd-bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate that did not take advantage of the time as valuable for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"for many years the Senate was late with the development of small quarter of grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games, or the construction of houses, stated Carola veit and Jan quast, the representatives of the German Social-Democratic Party (SDP).
While the SPD always demanding an integrated planning of olimpia for the small grasbrook and then to the use of the houses built, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request from Hamburg to the Olympic Games of the summer of 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not the boxes of wood.
That relates to the terms Sweden and box of wood, thinks in Ikea, but do not think about Andy warhol.
Or does it?
At the moment the boxes of wood produced in Sweden are as the shadow that weighs on the list of works of warhol.
The greater part of the 1990s and brillo-box of "type" of this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "expressen" put the question about the authenticity of shine-pits of 1968 of Andy warhol, the museum moderna of Stockholm carried out internal investigations, and came to conclusions: the six "shine-pits", that the museum hultén gave the museum moderna, are false, and almost a hundred of the other "type Stockholm", which are in circulation in the market of the international art, are also.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between the artistic and patrocionadas productions.
In 1964 warhol created in New York, its first "shine-pits", painted the boxes, blue boxes of red and white, with the same shows that had soap powder of soap "shine."
In accordance with warhol, in the exposure of their works of 1968 in the museum moderna were exposed hundreds of cardboard. These did not warhol (because of the expenses), but which were brought directly from the factory box "shine."
It was not a question of works of art, but of units (which was only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, warhol allowed to produce in Sweden of wood, but they were not exposed in the modern museet museum.
Witnesses of those times speak now that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered in the history of the art and the auction as original "brillo-boxes" to "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum hultén did false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the boxes of wood that warhol left it.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for hultén and the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
In this time had already died from 3 years ago.
Lars byström, the leader of the Conservatives in the museum moderna, investigated six shine-pits property of Museum and three of the Swedish private property that was made in 1968 in Stockholm. First be printed and polished its tightened and later at the painted with the.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without printing directly the tight; in addition it is not a question of the oil painting, but that of the paint.
"these boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be eliminated from the official list of shine-pits of Andy warhol", says Lars nittve, the director of the museum moderna and add that if the Commission of authentication "Andy warhol art" in New York did not come to any conclusion, the museum moderna classify these six boxes as copies / objects of exposure.
In July the Commission of authentication announced formally that accepts these "serious accusations" in that it is a question of boxes of soap dust.
But since that time there all remained in absolute silence.
