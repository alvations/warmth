Schneemangel on the mountains Haunts the hotel
Scneelose Runways Sorgenn not only Riesengebirgen-anwohnern.
The lack of snow Deterred people from appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
Why can we still free in Riesengebirge room for all Wintertermine Incl. and Christmas Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people are the prices, the offers, but now they are afraid to deliver.
And when you call, you ask us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on" mud, the operator of the Informationsportals Spindl.info, Martin Jandura.
Who Silvester-aufenthalt Spindelmühle Exactly wishes to his ideas, should not hesitate for even more with the appointment.
Who save and in the quality of the visit only in second place, the can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer now only for the Silvestertag largely Wochenaufenthalte.
I think that you are efforts to sell them for a while, but then they should also give, and shorter times.
And then the free room quickly, Jandura estimated.
Offers free beds in all Winterterminen always always travel Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now most interest the Weihnachtswoche, now is not Hazardous.
About half of the seats in our offer is still free.
Therefore, we have some cheaper Weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the final moment, the director of the travel Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Riesengebirge Vrchlabi-reisebüro also offer, but there is less free places.
Also good (the first fourteen days in February and the rest Wintertermine average sold.
This is a year in which the interest for the Winteraufenthalte is negative, that is not Riesengebirge snow.
The people wait to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants the end of the year without snow in the mountains.
The Runways should be within a week Verschneit, will also be the Christmas Hazardous, says Schiefert.
Reversed and something better than last year, the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod can Snezkou.
We are about five per cent better than last year.
On Silvestertag and Christmas we have only a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua in February, and the business is going well, informed the Director of the best Pec-hotels Karel Rada.
To 80% for the Silvesteraufenthalte the Omnia Hotel in Zentralparkplatz in Janske Lazne occupied.
However, remains on Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half the beds.
Pleasant surprise this year in January, for which we are already about 60%.
A Bit Weaker now February, but, at the moment when the snow comes, certainly also the interest in the periods Riesengebirge, the Director of the hotels Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Wait for a greater Schneebescherung the Riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer now.
On Thursday it should cool and if there is rain, the snow on the mountains.
But then is a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Wetteramtes in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost Comical, which Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the Brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan-frage repeatedly that he even for the Stupid.
When he finally his eagerly anticipated Afghanistan-doktrin Ausschwitzte, it emerged that he Busch-irak-szenariovor this on the Kopierpapier three years Abschrieb.
Not only is it several times in the text itself "the expression" as in Iraq, he has even used the name of the Bush- Declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "new Vorwärtsweg" used without Hesitation.
It has even three years ago the Bush-idee - fresh Troop in the civil send Troubled Iraq - as "irresponsible and in their Conclusions Karastrophische decision".
To following months showed, however, that the military recommendations Distressing very successful was the only possible and, to the extent that we talk about Iraq no longer in the news today.
Bush's reputation was not improved, because clearly has his successor a much Dankbarere starting Hintergelassen, as was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama Hopes that the miracle is repeated.
To increase the contingent were again asked the military, in particular the Oberkommandeur Afghanistan-operation General Stanley Mccristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten protect Zaudernden hard in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The President three months Hesitation, but with no better idea and he has Betrayed the general Wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
In Europe, he has Pressed the promise of another 5,000, even if he originally at least 10,000 expected.
Highly problematic in the Obama-strategie is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, this process and conclude within three years. The whole doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that Halved increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the Fratricide in recent years is also the Irak-gesellschaft relatively well Structured, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is Characterised by the Kontraindikation - you can rely on Anyone and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, are used every day to change their Mind.
The political institutions, even if they were set, only Scheinbauten formally correct, behind which the patriarchal Stammbeziehungen on Excel.
The balance between the different ethnic groups is Unusually complicated, particularly because of the Confusion of the situation, the Pakistan- and complicate Iran-einflüsse even further.
Also to build a "State Council", the Minimalist objective of the whole operation is very Unrealistic.
Frame the Obama-strategie surprised by his Voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and now it is on the brink of Explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers who cry broke out about the "Frühheimkehr" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul, is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view is the Datumssetzung for the Troop withdrawal pure Irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in combat in Afghanistan, is Running out.
Europe's politicians and want their Constituents cannot explain how the security of Germany or Italy with the war in Hindukusch-gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation radically, the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the sanctions on the Iranians, not for the United States there is a very serious question as to whether the problem cannot be Solved with troops.
This question must be Answered in the period in which America after Obama Moves Siegerabzug from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only Lip service to Barack Obama, is the fact that three years remaining until the presidential election, and leaving enough time so that it can Resort to a different strategy, Fallls would prove Totalausfall.

Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism, having for the first three quarters of this year set aside nearly $17 billion for Prämienboni.
The overall Prämienboni during this Jahra will continue after the Reuters press agency also likely despite the reported today exceed $20 billion.
The high Prämienboni in banking, with the Onset of the financial crisis in a whole range of Länders become the Burning political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of bankers, exceed the £25,000, unique with a tax of 50%.
Similar steps also preparing France.

Bulava is generally not started or been damaged in the air.
In the Russian media are already Talking about "Bulava" than a "missile, not Bound".
Shining a missile Flies, but
These 13 attempt at the beginning was normal.
Until the end of the flight are technical damage to the missile.
Probably the engine exploded in the third Raketenstufe.
Launched time "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp Enables the Shooting from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that caused by an Unspecified Fliegendes object Mysteriously light on Nordwegen Actually damaged "Bulava" was.
Moreover, the Norwegians since the first moment no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals Diesesmal Intervened and said that you cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were not affected, and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the same engines in the first stage were damaged.
Even if no Teststart without Error, the leadership of the Ministry only six of 13 for Unsuccessful.
The almost Combines success therefore meets the generals with optimism and it continues to claim that the "Bulava" fly without problems and even to ten Hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with carry a weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: a substance, even in the ´ tempered ´ viruses effect
The team of Czech and German scientists Testing new connections, prevent the spread of viruses in the Organism.
The main advantage of improved substance that he is also in the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact Outweighs the disadvantage that the link to usual Virus-varianten works, not so much as one of the existing medicines.
The AIDS cannot be Cured.
The patients can Medikamentenzusammenstellung but Prolong the life and prevent the proliferation of viruses in the body.
Their use is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Partial Suppression of Virus-vermehrung also has the development Sg. Resistentviren, against the no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences Cr Vscht (Chemisch-technologische Seminary) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how we can deal with the Virus-resistenz.
They have shown that the Metalokarborane substances on the Eiweißstoff, is responsible for the expansion of Hiv-viruses.
The Metalokarborane are Compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links, the Virus-vermehrung in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the Resistenz-problem.
In its work the scientists come to new ´ improved ´ links, based on the knowledge of their Molekularmechanismus Bonds were being prepared for the Viren-eiweißstoff.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two Vielfächige cages Bor-, hydrogen and Kohlenstoff-atomen and Consist of a Metall-atom, cobalt, are linked in this case.
Heimtückisches and sustainable virus
Hiv-protease is Eiweißstoff of HIV, is vital for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the damage caused by the Hiv-protease Hiv-virus-spaltung no tyres Infektionsvirenpartikel.
If we exclude the Hiv-protease, Switch the Reproduction of the virus in the body of the patients, the researchers explain in the press, the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences Cr was issued.
In the work of the Wissenschaftszeitung Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe whole ranks of connections, in which two couples cages (see table) are linked by a Brief organic chain, then Systematically changed.
A Weaker, but reliable
The impact of this number of substances on the Hiv-protease Wurdne in In-vitro tested, including their constant (resistant) variants of Hiv-infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane on the usual Enzym-variante is not as strong as in the Clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the Resistentvarianten against the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique Wirkungsmechanismus and their other characteristics, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and further chemical kinds, the Metalokarboranen interesting links for further research Directed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Strukturbiologie Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute because budget. ODS was to Fishermen, is Resisting
The Chairman described the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, the approved budget for the next year as "Terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer in his view, should consider their continued existence.
The statement of ODS described the Prime Minister as "strong Aussprüche".
It is time for the analysis.
The Deputy Ods-vorsitzende, Petr Necas, said that the concept of Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the Cssd, ODS and Grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
After Necas the Prime Minister must decide whether it intends to take to the minority in the Parliament, if we are Talking about the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be remain in office through the Parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically Depart, Necas referred to.
On Wednesday, the Parliament approved the budget for the year 2010, but with Linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen more than 12 billion kronor.
The Parliament has the money for Staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The Government has pointed out that the proposals in the social they Subtly increase the deficit.
Czech Republic with a Backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the Desire of the government, because the amended budget is just a less bad variant of Budgetprovisoriums. Frase not Clear
Frustration and Futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of Futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government Assessed the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendments were to be adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television, Janota on Monday after the Regierungsgeschäft with Premier.
In doing so, he indicated that he considered another remain in office.
Reason is his disappointment over the Verhandugn's budget.
How Fishermen for the fight with Budget-defizit, have Necas the Nominanten of Social Democrats (Cssd), the Enforced changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The Prime Minister should make it clear that he will resign if the Parliament continues to Defizit-steigernde Adopts laws, for example those concerning sickness and pensions or the Dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek, Nominated by the ODS ministers were wrong not
That is a matter for the Prime Minister and the government.
The ODS Nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a Textmeldung from the US.
It pointed out that in some of the Ministries in function people sit at top 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fishermen favour decides, on the fight against Defizit-höhe public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he supposedly can Count on the support and tolerance of the Two-pronged not.
I have not thought about it, and if that is now, I will, said of the Two-pronged Nominee for Defense Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fishermen Flew afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS stood down at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Prime Minister would ask members of the Two-pronged Explicitly, that the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not reduced.
I have not noticed that my vote would lack.
Already at the mandate, I knew that in coming months in particular to Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction were all positive, Topolanek itself.

The Fernlangstrecken in the capital in the Zielstation Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The Cd is more demonstrates that houses Sc Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to be Sumperk / Jesenik the Mismatch of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.

The trains are appointed and paid by the department, the railways to pay the so-called Liquiditätsverlusts total in the next four billion kronor, Genaus as this year. Lokalzüge supply the districts, overall pay you in next year eight billion kronor, with the state Zuschießt three billion.
In Regionalzüge 200 million Czech crowns this year are expensive.
For the Lokalzüge and trains, the rail has a Zehnjahresvertrag newly completed until now the treaty was only for a year.
The railways Applauds the system, perhaps it has also not to increase the vast majority of One-way.
To changes it is only One-day Netzfahrscheinen Cd net and favourable Internetfahrscheinen Eliska.
For passengers without the Kundenkarte the price Cd net increased from SEK SEK 450 to 600.
The price Eliska trips then depend until now, ” he was for travel between any Bezirkstädten Uniformly and cost 160 kroner.

Jancura complaint for slander against three head the Cssd.
The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jancura, this complaint for slander against three Sozial-demokratische leaders.

The complaint Relates to the effort the company, the Regionalzugverkehr in some districts.
All regions have but ultimately signed long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three are attacking us and say that we pick the Cherries, we have made the offer only on the scope, as was agreed with you.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech Railways, because we know the price of Czech railways were completed last week.
So we have no alternative other than to us.
Because this Slur on the Society Student Agency, said Jancura Radiojournal.
At the same time, he gave to that evidence from all districts that they have taken steps in accordance with the Periodically.
Why we are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hasek the collection of the complaint for further the Medialshow Jancura, as free advertising for his company and for his own person.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against Pneumokokken from January the usual.
It should be free and voluntary a first for the families.
But now have that the Pflicht-impfung would be effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken Culminate.
The Arzneiinstitut set the maximum price of vaccines already, the health insurance have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the Impfungsverfahren.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August-kinder
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken children free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not received a Impfdosis ST.
Who started with the vaccination in last year or earlier, must also pay Weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first Impfdosis Vaccine-preventable between 3 and 5 of the child must be given.
Already last year, a quarter of families against Pneumokokken vaccinate their children.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the Youngest children four doses are needed.
As a whole, the experts, that the health insurance for the Impfdosen SEK 300,000 to 450,000 per year.
They save but the treatment, the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all Flächenimpfungen children spent around 500,000 per year.
The Pflicht-impfung was introduced with the so-called Janota-paket.
Pneumokokken cause Mittelohrentzündung, but also serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and Blutvergiftung.
We die by Pneumokokkeninfektionen for investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
Outside the Czech Republic was the Pflicht-impfung children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
At the same time said that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January should be paid for by the insurance and voluntarily.
That Pflicht-impfung would be better, said the head of the Bürgervereinigung Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association promoting in the long term Pneumokokken-impfung.
The experts at the International Conference, in which our group was involved, were not very happy that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed, at least the.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Department of Health does not change the Impfverfahren against Pneumokokken.
At this moment we are considering not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its Disadvantages, say doctors.
The Chairman of the Fachgesellschaft of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, that are a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then of Wiederholungsimpfungszahl might "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has launched a voluntary," says Allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80% of parents vaccinate their babies against Pneumokokken next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is Groundbreaking, is that this is the first Flächenimpfung paid by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so save it for further treatment, Erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
So that is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial projects should the vaccines are purchased by Insurers and then the doctors in the same way, as well as other vaccines, issued by the State to them.
But some feared that the insurance "the money from the Krankenversicherungherausführen could".
Purchases are the doctors the vaccines themselves and therefore have to wait until the insurance you pay this.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors must invest 40 000 SEK per month, which is a significant sum of money.
That will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time of Swiss voters voted for a ban on building for Minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is Widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a Thorough and Thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated in the Definition Säkularisiertesten societies of Europe – and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book Admiration for the last work of the author: "why the French not Headscarves love" (Originaltitel: why the French Don ’ t like read Headscarves) (2006), an elegant and Densely Argumentierenden study a dispute, over half the country shared decades and employees and their Implications are still play today.
Bowens Neustes book offers a more comprehensive and Kühneres range.
As good anthropologist, he not only know what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and colleges, the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic space".
He is a good Listener, he debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a Hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims are lessons about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it Permissible for a Muslim to use a Zinsorientiertes banking to get a Mortgage?
It is these Seemingly Mundane Affairs, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a Familiar name, Possibly with the Exception of Tarik Ramadan, a born in Switzerland Arab-muslim Scholars and Academics.
This new generation tried to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The Thinkers and activists, Bowen Respondents Disagree with their Salafi-gegenstücken mostly – supporters of the Liberalist Sunni Islam, is connected with Saudi Arabia – the today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values could be compatible and French secularism.
, a Convention requires give and take on both sides.
It is question how French political Decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so Passionate Guarded the Separation of Church and State) really pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a Rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make its historical compromise with the secular republicanism.
It Acknowledges a "Tightening Werteschrauben" rather than a growing pragmatism.
The Islam can be French? after reading this book is Inclined to say 'yes, but not yet. "

Prüfungsdaten show persistent Rassenkluft
The evidence at the Mathematikleistung last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington still far behind the country's schools, the Excellence, the evidence shows that the Viert- and Achtklässler progress in the last two years Faster than Towns and cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what the latest figures of the national assessment of Bildungsfortschritts (National Assessment of Educational Progress, including Naep) is the persistent Leistungskluft between African-American and white pupils, both at a local and national level.
The average marks the white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. increased in the past two years by 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) their African-American counterparts, but only three points from 209 rose to 212.
In reality the Leistungskluft rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a Statistically Negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average marks white pupils was not included in the test, the Stichprobenumfang was not big enough.
The picture is not encouraging over a Six-year.
The gap, white and black Viertklässler Separated in 2003, when the first Naep gathered in this district was 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the Scoring, the children of both groups, increased during this period, it has Hardly been reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some Bildungsbefürworter of Distrikts last week expressed its concern that the results of Schulkanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and celebrated the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children,.
This suggests that we Gesamtwertung raised by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Board of DC Voice, a non-profit group, the Bildungsgleichheit in Washington D. C..
I Dip for a range of two or three points up and down, said the Democratic Washington Stadtratsmitglied Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class Eaton-grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critic of the Managementstils of Rhee said, the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary need urgent attention.
Course would always see the positive signs that I respect.
What Frightens me is that we do not close to invest time and energy that we use our Mittelschule.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of Leistungsschwachen pupils.
In this autumn, for instance, some teachers will be trained to use a new Leselehrplan Wilson-lese-system, pupils in the senior classes of primary school, and Mittelschule which skills of reading not on their Schullaufbahn have Mastered and significantly behind their counterparts, classmates.
The Everyday mathematics curriculum, from kindergarten to Sixth class games and Lebensechte experience, Highlights under the former senior Schulinspektor Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum, some of Naep-fortschritte reported last week, attributed.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures to benefit pupils, who are below the Notenniveau, said Rhee.
Others say that the Naep-ergebnisse question, whether Rhee so it can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to play the Extra cash and the resources available to the Leistungsschwachen schools, are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the Urban Audit.
The conventional remedy is its resources and management reforms Directed towards the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington DC.
The objective could create political Aftermath, work against this important Item on the agenda.
The point is, of course, as with other urban Schulinspektoren that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, which is Schulinspektor in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to the closure of the Leistungskluft is the traditional public school, in Washington now is 180 days, to extend to Compete with the Charter-schulen.
We must increase the school close to 200 days, have the power to change, said Janey, its Lehrergewerkschaft last year came to an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a Milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.

In truth includes one of five of the "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner College – which is a remarkable achievement, since many of its Unjustly parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, in the US, without the Highschool have finished.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the workforce of the country, show the way forward.
Those who investigate the High-achieving children, say this often have a natural affinity for the school and an inherent Incentive to success.
Many of you have also set high targets parents who give their children, and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But Beratungsprogramme also play an important role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to come at college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at Low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche by the system, a single measure at any time will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, the Hispanoamerikanische students.

Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must Reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the powers soon "impose significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not participated in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the Kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 soldiers in northern Iraq and the Prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran are no good Opportunities for choice a soldier, he said in response to the question on the Likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things I on the soul, if in the last six years we have learned something from Iraq, the war Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama a Sanktionspaket considering that aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the Durchschnittsiraner.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required "to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact, nuclear weapons less protected" Monsters ", because" their people will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a report by the White House, spokesman Robert Gibbs, the American government Endorsed the European leaders in the warning that Iran must Count on "credible" consequences, if he continues with its nuclear program rather than the demands of the Security and Atom-überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency,.

The US government has Pressed for this type of agreement, to build confidence between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.

That Iran in the international community about some of the proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, simply left has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way together, as it did in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran never were, "said Gates.
President Obama has 31 Dez. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton again called "Crippling sanctions" to continue.
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what they "Gratuitous and foundation claims some retained on Thursday called on the Iranian Atomaktivitäten and said that they are ready to the talks with the United States and five other powers," achieving an appropriate long-term solution.

The tensions between the Kurds and Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public Revenues.
Gates urged both sides to the conflict to prevent arms to reduce delays to the US plan, the American troops by the end of August of 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought to Allay the Kurdish concern about the Forthcoming withdrawal. Us-vertreter quoted Gates of Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We are their security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by Propagandaplakaten to give Lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to further children" and "a baby means more grave more".
These lessons have you learned as well that when government officials in Shanghai, the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, Suddenly began to change course and young couples, more than to have a child, Ermunterten immediately and Definitively your Answer was: "in no way".
We have all our time and energy Invested in a child.
For a second child is left with nothing, said Wang, 31, a Personalleiterin with a 8-monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously Dicklichen spoiled Einzelkindern Affectionately called "little Emperor", has Produced, a Bevölkerungskrise in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, like the UN
Department for population, while the number of the population 60 years and older in the year 2020 of 16.7% of the population by the year 2050 31,1% rise Exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is in rich coastal with educated people, like Shanghai, more.
Last year, 60-year Inundate and older reported almost 22% of residents identified during the birth of a child has been a per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Stadtbevölkerungs- and Familienplanungskomission said that couples in Zeugungsfähigen old babies, "to help reduce the proportion of ageing Percentages and to Alleviate the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not as rich as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child may be available the controversial, the ruling Communist Party was introduced today.
Couples who violate this policy, with huge fines -- until their triple salary in some regions, and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese Staatsvertreter this policy is that the critical demands of the natural Landesressourcen could be avoided, while activists have condemned Abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some pregnant officials who have already had a child, forced to Abzutreiben.
Many couples had Geschlechtsselektive abortions, leaving a Unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, officials have for population gradually weakened their position on the child.
2004, they have allowed more exceptions the rule -- including residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was Moderated the tone of many slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Bevölkerungsforschung Beijing University, said that officials have recently discussed even radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children, which is a partner Einzelkind.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which has Mounted an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters Belehrten families to just one child, almost Overnight have been replaced by directives describe in Detail who is Challenging for a second child and how to apply for Approval.
The City Council has sent urban employees and volunteers for planning, couples home and Durchzuschieben Sheets under the doors.
They also asked, psychological and financial advice to the to provide the more than a child.
The response was not encouraging, said Familienplanungsvertreter.
Disappointing response
Although officials of a rural town in the Außenbereichen in Shanghai said that a recovery in the requests from couples to see the launch of the campaign want a second child, the urban districts Reporting no change.
In the community Huinan go with a population of 115.000 as example still only four or five requests per month.
Shanghai fell officials say that the expected number of births in the city for 2010 despite the campaign still at approximately 165,000 -- is slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Familienplanungskomitees Shanghai municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and it is also legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and insurance the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are Wrongly Assessing the one-child than human rights, said Yang, an engineer, his wife is pregnant with their first child in the seventh month.
Yes, Undermining the possibility to have more than one child.
The problem, however, Lies not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the Personalleiterin, said she would only a child, because she was also a Einzelkind. "we were used to the centre of the family and that everyone has Cared about us.
We are not used to other care and do not really want this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-jähriger, a Übersetzungsunternehmen said it Plain.
For parents from the middle class with Doppelkarriere by the birth, he said, it is to be successful and it must be selfish.
The age of 20 to 39-jährigen grew so to their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fighting not to see and they want a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, is also huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the Raumfrage -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life -- if the child is 9 months old, we must already have a CV for the best Nursery ready. "
As most of his friends are prepared, this is a time Durchzumachen, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many victims.
Drafting panel plan to reduce emissions
The conference promoted by the UN, which up to now by Wild Posturing and mutual accusations of Merit -- on Friday with the publication of document established a priority for the next 40 years, Recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, and developed in the near future the greatest burden Shoulders.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on regulation of greenhouse gases, might provide both ‚ the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But it was seen as an important progress in negotiations, the time, as more than 100 leaders from around the world next week will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text was drawn up by a Specially created UN working, says about the money supply, the rich countries should give to poor countries, so that they can meet the Short- and long-term global warming.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including industrial and emerging economies can limit their carbon and what should be the upper limit of global warming, would support the political Decision-makers.
The process is a great flexibility, John Coequyt, senior representatives of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the pages document has drafted a 180 pages long Verhandlungstext, Summarised in the centre, which the leading Klimaschutzvertreter, de Boer, the UN has described as "the big picture".
It shows the Outline of a possible agreement, which developed together their emissions by 25% to 45% by 2020, in comparison with the limits of 1990, while Larger developing countries, would reduce their emissions would reduce by 15 to 30% in the same period.
Together the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has the talks on Friday also Encouraged by your assurance, over the next three years, $3.6 billion per year in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from champions of floods and Droughts to prevent deforestation.
The Friday brought the same verbal Fireworks, which Governs the talks in the last week.
The American Klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern has rejected Wording, the binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if these are not Financed by the industrial.
This train announced that the Obama a Tougher line with China, as the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without any significant emerging stand up and take action, so Stern, also Lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern was its opinion an hour after the declaration of Vizeaußenministers Eh Yafei, meant that the leading American Klimaunterhändler either lacking in "reason" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States would help China not, to meet the global warming.
By the future economic direction of the major powers is at stake, both within the industrial, as well as between the industrialized and emerging Fault lines.
The current fight refers also to the individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States, because of their respective obligations amongst, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take Bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers to fight who should bear the costs of the Slowing of the greenhouse, because even affected countries have moved to aggressive action, the countries with very high Treibhausgasabgabe to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, will develop a new economic Domination, Ulate, the regional Klimawandelberater for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a page draft Treaty on early Friday.
Artur Runge-metzger, the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island "putting political pressure on the political process," partly because they are united and actions of the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates is focused on the fact that the most Outstanding issues still need to be resolved before the arrival of the painted, to come to an agreement.
Senior officials, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vizeminister Entstiegen their aircraft and breaks through the Corridors of Bella-centers meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to Trans-border, be Negotiated during the course of the next week.
The Sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13 people every day in the Kongresszentrum, and from Gitarrespielende activists holding night shows, where they are making fun of the countries, the feel Betrayed and sell, and draft of hands instead passed via e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is based just on: almost all important ministers are now and Wednesday will be 60 painted in Copenhagen.
We shall now Proceed to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.

Britain's first defined the Montagsgefühl new 225 km / h Faster train
Monday at 5 p.m. 13 will announce a Pipe the Darkness, a Zugabfahrt, which represents a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first Hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country in its Blitzfahrt Ashfort, Kent to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
With Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will then Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin-pendlerservices from London.
Finally, he Hopes that the new service Britain for an international network of rapid, reliable trains Ankoppeln and the major Metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London will.
The neglected province could be living Pendlerstädten, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car rail would reduce the national carbon and congestion on the roads.
In theory believe the three large parties in this vision.
But many billion British pounds, which are necessary for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable Planungsschlacht environmental damage and fears about the British Hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still take the brakes.
High Speed Two (Hs2), a company based in January, the Government will present a Viability, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
It receives a detailed Streckenkarte the next stage of the Hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new railway, which will link London to the West Midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and vicinity in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
Hs2, three options for a major, leading Northwards Hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetz.
Lord Adonis will spring to respond.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-förmige route, in which a single high-speed would lead in the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would lead the Western Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in North-east of Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It appears to be the most effective option," said a Eisenbahn-insider.
After the completion of the Wastes between London and Edinburgh would reduce to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first Teilstrecke not be opened before 2025, would allow the passengers, the route London-birmingham in 49 minutes today, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals offer the trains, the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km / h, the British rail network which Quickest Europe.
The first route has been planned that 400 metres long with a Maximalkapazität of 1,100 people can travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operating on the route London-birmingham.
This in turn would mean that a Terminus in London would be necessary on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be Processed.
Given the space Limitations in the capital is expected that an existing station would be developed to fit the high-speed.
Bahnexperten say that only St Pancras Internationally or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will know whether, in his view, this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and Planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But if he put the wheels in motion, the rail network in sections must be built.
The first of the high-speed trains should change to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which Wastes between London and Scotland would be in about three hours.
This is a key Sticking point, a Switch from air to rail can be Ensured a Beacon for the Schienenrevolution.

Liliane Indictment Bettencourt: François-marie Banier is Convicted of exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday, the artist François-marie Banier to assess to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt claims, a weak moment of 80 has being Cheated, a part of their assets.
The 62-jährige photographer, who is known for his Starfotos, on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness before trial, a criminal offence, with a maximum of three years ’ imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375.000 Punished.
In fact, this decision means that it will be a process in this Affair, the saga is one of the richest families of France, in the mother and daughter Scrap and at the same time the reins of Kosmetikimperiums L'Oréal.
But as the 15 Strafkammer ordered a medical examination of 87-jährigen Liliane Bettencourt, to be implemented Jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, above all, under the conditions put forward during the investigation by the Prosecutor of Nanterre.
The doctors, even before the appointed on Friday 10 March 2010, present a report in which they clearly known whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found in a state of weakness.
I think it will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer of Françoise Mehr me Olivier Metzner is concerned, he is very pleased with the decision of the Court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he manipulated (Banier) this old lady, which must be protected, he reiterated.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt a criminal complaint against François-marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler Initiated and accused him to have Exploited the weakness of its mother years, order grants a total of EUR 1 billion in the form of Bankschecks, insurance policies or Paintings being Cheated.
Part Liliane had been Refuted Bettencourt always manipulated by the Photographers to it as a Long-time friend.
Although the Court should examine the admissibility of the complaint Initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-meyers, Plaidoyers the lawyers on Friday led to a major Familiendebakel.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt on three of its Klientin of their lawyer sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Mehr Distrusted.
According to her lawyer added Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I for 15 years, once or twice daily as Banier wrote.
Françoise I can speak more since their marriage ".
Once again, the prosecutor's office in Nanterre is of the opinion that the Plaintiff had no right to respond, in particular because a Vormundschaftsrichter in recent days has rejected their request to launch a judicial protection against their mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully Rechtsfähig is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf ", the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-christine Daubigney.
The Court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Mehr has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic Frühaufklärung?
If there is no change in the leadership of major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies in terms of its staff, said the position of the business partner of consumers before the Marketing-revolution: it is intended for the staff "values" join the best, as it was on the Consumer-produkte Shaped by the technicians in the work.
By the customers in the heart of the company has Marketing-revolution strategies of the conquest of markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation Separated products factors another regularly to impose preferences of customers.
The Demobilisation of staff can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much Wider phenomenon, particularly affects the employees.
This Demobilisation has a negative effect on the development of intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & Eund, which is crucial to those of economic intelligence.
In fact calls the Iu (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all involved parties (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it claims by staff use the Instructions of authoritarian management entirely.
We therefore Urge a revolution, which would Involve the staff in Denmittelpunkt the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very use internal Polls
Are the internal Polls, as the questionnaire, Orange Lohnempfängern, this revolution in terms of the Management-praxis suggest?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- firstly, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many Roundabout is concerned, priority... to do what it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - a Pathology of power should be Proportionate to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behaviour.
Emerged from the great Ingenieurschulen is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
You take intellectual comfort the old Behavioristische theory, which recently by the U.S. "neuroscience" reactivated and Unknowingly Far-reaching research and disseminated by the media.
And therefore, it suggests that it is possible to "Lever" (sic) to the commitment of employees, a Aktuellein Le appeared Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos Executives in a mechanistic approach to management, which is unsuited to today's world.
The Mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and measure
Instead is a necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies Occupational revolution of the adoption of the Definitive view of human behaviour.
It is, in any Consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental minutes: for the workers is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly a means, a part to achieve their dreams, their Designers and their projects.
Now take the studies from the Multifunctional analysis this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set Doxa judge them by their Widely-perceived image the company allowed to assess what it gives them to achieve their goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these Mobilisierungsfaktoren can the leaders of companies anticipate their "social service" control, predict and and their human Resource management in the right place.
So they are creating a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and Efficient economic intelligence is favourable.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" Obama praise of a right
On Friday, the American right has Barack Obama on the eve speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 Welcomes the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the Awarding of the prize to Obama Derided on 9 October, applauded the President's speech this time, the example of the former Vizepräsidentschafts-kandidatin following the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the "necessary" war in Ihrensoeben published memoirs have raised.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, it says.
Obama, the inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in Oslo on Thursday sought to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good job".
I think that the speech was very good, Frohlockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world," in the words of Obama.
In some parts of Habeich this speech, even perceived as Historically, Ginrich declared that the radio was asked "the Takeaway".
The previous member of by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination in 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the left", the members of the Nobel remembered that they were "not free and a prize for peace could not pass, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson George W. Bush, a former writer and editor at the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
Addition, that it "Kosmopolit", as "there is power", he mentioned "as an American president," as he pointed out that the Europeans "how to live in a Sicherheitsblase, which they themselves are not created, and whose protection they do very little," Gerson.
Of the few, not convinced rights called the former Uno-botschafter John Bolton, a Hawk the Bush era, the speech on the Website of the National Review Online as "Boring, Pompous and Inspirationslos".
To the left of the president is the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich Worried about how Barack Obama defended the use of the armed forces.
Packaged the war under the Guise of the judiciary, the massacre of innocent is quite simply justified, he warns.
The press Praised the moderate left, but continues to the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was Premature to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, "Monumental".
The speech in Oslo "provides a Ablaufplan to management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times that Obama announced "the necessary Discourse" and his speech as "dark and Exemplary".

Stuttgart brake
The Dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the Proponents of the project is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the Tieferlegen a station, more than a Faceless works, the city of Baden-württembergischen capital into Utter Baustellenchaos system for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is the spirit of the 1980 years.
Kopfbahnhöfe end with Tracks, in the middle of the city, were then Verkehrstechnische fossils of the nineteenth century, the Riot as a modern rail lot of time worked, as it was once, Umzuspannen Locomotives from behind forwards.
Harvest, Brief, drive - ´ s should go further.
And why should the Kopfbahnhöfe disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a Durchfahrtsbahnhof, at approximately Half-way through the trans-European Schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan "heart of Europe".
S21 will now Actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s years no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have Realised that the Hesse and the Bavarian city almost Priceless is to Implement the Tieferlegen.
Kopfbahnhöfe, however, no longer an Import and Ausfahrtsproblem, since modern Wendezüge with Locomotives and Steuerwagen at both ends.
Yet Stuttgart 21: and the Ice-neubaustrecke Ulm is now being addressed.
Nationwide and local have got.
The railways, power because the risks of the Republic's greatest Infrastruktur-einzelprojekts of taxpayers and not the Staatskonzern.
Städtebaulich the project could be Reasonably justified.
There is new Stadtraum to - believes the Computergenerierten Illustrating the planners - with much green.
Rail for the transport system is S21.
The Durchgangsbahnhof and the Streckenausbau are typical of the movement which, 1980s - huge growth imposed.
Then there was not the competition from Low-cost Carriers.
But modern transport must first seek to strengthen the goods, since the transport by rail is significantly cleaner than by Lorries on the road.
But the Neubaustrecke did for Vitriolic climbs for freight trains.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other Crossing.
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen Verbuddelt.
That is the official number.
Experts think ten to 15 billion is realistic.
Fact is, in the next decade, will the money in other Locations and Engstellen in network.
Total 60 major projects are on the list of Verkehrsministeriums.
One of the most important is the development of 180 km route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, built on the route in Zeitlupentempo.
Desperately needed, right here on the Tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintalstrecke is bottleneck for the international transport of goods: at the heart of Europe.

Support the future Academics received by the President of the Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (Hrk), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, the Hrk discussed a common Reformpapier.
The Union education and science (Gew), Bonn decisions not far enough: it requires a legal Entitlement, of each graduates with a Bachelor-abschluss access to a secondary masters.
Secondly, the countries must ensure that sufficient Masterstudienplätze for the current generation of Bachelor-studierenden tomorrow with best available to studying, Gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas Cellar.
The countries must be much more lecturers.
To a Freer access to master culture, were not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Raised in Germany and is well almost no control... "is the Anfangszeile a poem of Lyrikers Werner Sets, with this Troubling Sprachfetzen won the Ankunftserfahrung dissidents, of freedom, but also lost its language.
The 1951 born in Romanian Banat Werner Sets first as Deutsch- and Englischlehrer in Bucharest and, later, Lektor, before he worked in a Kinderbuchverlag to Frankfurt am Main Übersiedelte in 1982.
Sets has been with various Literaturpreisen Prize, 1993 he was the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen in Goethe-universität, and since 2002 he is head of the Hesse Literaturforums in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major Außerliterarisches caused a Stir on Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitateakten".
Visibly confused and Sets read a statement, in which he Rumäniendeutschen Schriftstellerkollegen, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak his cooperation, and Helmuth Frauendorfer than for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of the present Sets 1989 had received German Sprachpreis.
The Anwerbungsversuche gradually started first 1971.
I am, Söllner, 'someone who has Campaigned against intimidation of the Securitate not enough. "
The poet Werner Sets is Walter.
Almost at the same time Nobelpreisehrung for Herta Müller and whose literary Dealing with the mechanisms of Dictatorial rule will Literaturszene and in particular the community of German authors shaken by a case Arising from Romania, identify the Yawning and evil of a political system that is based on monitoring and Spying.
Werner Sets is so far, following Bisherigem knowledge can say not only Criminals, but also victims.
In his Securitate-akte had played a role in Walter, said after the confession Söllners Literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it all for him was sensitive points "Herausgehauen," Markel.
There is a moral need to make this point.
Söllners statement in the form and this audience was unexpected, quite surprising is the commitment of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian intelligence.
Germany is a Cosy reserve for Securitate-spitzel, Herta Müller had already been written in July at a time, having their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The affected, must be suspect, speculation and in some case have known what Klarname behind the Aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter Second-term.
Unlike the here now very Verfahrenssicheren filter the Stasi-akten is Dealing with the legacy of Securitate-überwachung still very Vague.
A systematic education is undermined and been hampered in recent years.
A Birthler-behörde National Council for Processing the Securitate-akten (Cnsas) was set up in 1999, since the publication of the documents was rather slow.
Only since 2005 there is a law governing the management of files.
Former Securitate-mitglieder ’ s influence is still very high in Romania, finished an interview following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate-chef from Temesvar Derogatory Remarks about the Recipient.
They have a psychosis, finally they Interrogated only once.
The infamy of power said quite Openly to express in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly linked to the case Sets, as so often in connection with Sneak Blame, Unavoidable questions.
Why only now? who was hurt? the Measured response of listen to Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of Wissensdrang rather than determined by Apportioning Blame and shame.
To Genese of Herta Müller's book, has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It looked as if is a smart Gekleideter Außendienstler of a happy Christmas to a sports Goodies had distributed, as the new Vfb-trainer Christian gross in a orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters minutes after midnight in a Herbeigerufene C-klasse. ¨

It has a certain magic, was Babbel-befürworter Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which they would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, Aground Verletzungspause thanks to its dynamism Straight to the best players tried to place wake, the observed phenomenon "with the proverbial" fresh air "and to describe the operation of new Superiors:" He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "

But at least they were with all other agree that without the work of the Abgelöste Trainerteam Portfolios and Vindictive, strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann chorus, and the man with the plastic bag agreed.

Case Kunduz
Frontal opposition: Grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, defence Guttenberg for false information to Kunduz-affäre called a Liar.
SPD and left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - following the recent findings on the air of Kunduz the opposition defence Karl-theodor Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The Minister for the deadly Bombing two Tanklastzüge September "Knowingly the Falsehood," said said Grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the Ard-nachrichtensendung "story".
The Landläufig one: he lied.
The Orders to kill is contrary to the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been given here.
That is the substance of the report, the NATO, Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.

Traumwelten
Some see in Wachem state images and hear voices, the other not see or hear.
Not only mentally ill and in Drogenrausch Blurring the boundaries between Fantasy and reality.
When it happens in the sleep, all is in order.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, let us Likes the Wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden.
But those in Wachsein Traumartige seen, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world is mostly as crazy or Drogensüchtig, at least as Sonderling.
But such images and voices Arise not only mentally ill or in Drogenrausch.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or writing novels, sometimes ensure that Blurred the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Traumartig modified Wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the visions of Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, Drogenerlebnisse of New-age-propheten Carlos Castaneda, Schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the brain's neural Botenstoffe - all, dopamine, Noradrenaline and serotonin and Acetylcholin - lose and the interaction of various Gehirnteile is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and Wahnhafte thoughts are often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The Gravity has no power over him
The context of Delusion and dream, philosophers and physician since antiquity.
Aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of dream state Guard, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of Irreseins with Traumzuständen", the dream of Sigmund Freud was "a psychosis, with all the Inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen perceptions of such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. turned into a Comicfigur.
His body is Zweidimensional and Quietschbunt.
The Gravity has no power more Hanging over him, he Zimmerdecke.
He Senses a.
Behind him t Teufelsgestalten with Blutroten, Distorted Fratzen, Zähnefletschend.
They hunt him, him with serious, Inflammatory boots, it against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Noisy, Malicious vote roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the votes to Upbraid and Insult him.
Henning T. Tackles two Cable from the stereo, Knotet a Noose and Consolidating it in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a Loudspeaker and establishes the Noose around the neck.
Stands.
The Noose is.
This should be a lesson to you, the vote in Trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, shouting "walk in the clinic and let you cure."
Today is 40 years old, he has six Henning T. acute psychosis, the last 2 years, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is Schizoaffektive-paranoide psychosis, he is Manisch-depressiv, drugs, against depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In the psychosis I most fear and Deepest despair, he says.
The Mere empty are cruel reality
About one per cent of people with schizophrenia, at least once during their life in psychiatric hospitals is being treated as second disease after the Depression.
In an emergency schizophrenic psychosis affected mostly can no longer distinguish between the internal and outside, they get Trapped in a Übererregten state of affairs that can lead to hallucinations, Geometry, Relationships or Paranoia.
Particularly is the Stimmenhören -, the Orders, or Dialogisieren comment.
Also Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The important can no longer be Separated from Unwichtigem, the brain disturbing signals can no longer Ausfiltern awareness is Awash with impressions.
As the dream the psychosis also opens the Floodgates for a Raft of ideas and fantasies, the Bewusstseinsschichten come from.
The Realitätswahrnehmung psychosis is Subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fox, Oberarzt clinic for general psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is in the heart of the storm, everything has its importance to him.
While equipment in a passive role, he will, like the dream, Overwhelmed by the events and actively Shape it cannot.
Schizophrenia is often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A Realitätsabgleich is usually not possible, the Mere empty are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in life to have seen a hallucinations
Fox says that unlike in the dream "but remains the Sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, the perceived psychosis, and principle".
The Obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the Alienation of Erlebens will take place in real time.
Exactly why our Brains antics, researchers still proposes Puzzle.
Ausnahmezustände in each people can mean that it Loses touch briefly, Fox said.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but Zwillingsstudien have shown that genes are not the only Determining factors.
Researchers assume that affected Minimal brain.
We suspect that the Pancreatic maturation of the brain in an early stage of development is hampered by a virus of the mother during pregnancy for example, Fox.
But there remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, is also not Manifestiere first for many years.
Also environmental factors play a role - stress or traumatic events can be a trigger for psychosis if the disposal is there.
Hallucinogens drugs can also trigger psychosis, as in the Transmittersystem intervention.
If our Brains hot Runs
This is crazy, Psychotiker suffer from hallucinations and Swallow expensive drugs to get rid of it, other money for drugs in order to get the Lübecker says Psychologieprofessor Erich Castes.
Whether perceived as Mere empty pleasant or unpleasant, is often a question of position.
Reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen Castes is Collecting for ten years, in the last year, his results in the book "The Fantasy world in Mind".
Hallucinations belong to the typical effects of psychoses, but also of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Borderline or depression often diseases such as Migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly Halluziniert under certain conditions the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, Castes, from Gedächtnisinhalten normally be Withheld.
They are, if Hirnareale, which Processed sensory Overreacted are Discouraged or too little, when our Brains hot or, if stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just as brain or a psychosis.
But also Reizentzug, stress, Liebeskummer or other mental Ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies up to one third of the Respondents to a hallucinations to experience at least once during their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl, Actually.
If the images and voices.
In the Interval it can happen that a Schlaksiger young with long, dark hair it.
Look if it Responds to the classmates it surprised - no one else sees or hears these young.
They believe the Timid girl for a Versponnene Tagträumerin but not Sarah K. dreams, it knows it.
It is awake, you see or hear these young girls, just as it has in the bank next to see or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for Moments.
A pleasant feeling is they like the young.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this young and the other is not real are Mere empty and then disappear again.
Night are the phenomena often frightening
Often the Mere empty are a burden.
When they Klassenraum, can Unterrichtsstoff sometimes, because the teachers in their eyes and ears Unveils a new classmates, while for all other hearing and visible at the Banqueting Mathematical equations.
Night are the phenomena often frightening.
If your dark waiting rooms to sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they often cannot tell whether it is awake or already Dreaming of, whether the pictures you see the Fratzen or the girl with the bleeding Schnittwunden arms and legs, its open or closed eyes.
Let me, make it the cry.
Parents and friends told them nothing, would you consider is mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year they have passed the Baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations.
Since it started in Internet contact with the Psychologists box, it knows that it is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from Reizentzug, he most likely after a while hallucinations, says Castes.
I suspect that the brain is Underemployed and provides for its own Entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, as a little girl fear of other children, often played they Alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 learned that the man she called Daddy, since it can think, is not your Leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations Hirnbereiche active are also real impressions and Sounds as Sarah K. affected process, it is difficult to distinguish Mere empty and reality. "every experience," says, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images can give the brain, why are they so real. "
Night Traumbilder also sees Caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the position to identify their Mere empty as Unrealistic.
Castes advises his patients therefore the hallucinations as a special ability Wertzuschätzen.
Grenzzustand between dream and hallucinations
In our very Bewusstseinszentrierten world will see imaginary unfortunately most Pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt-degenhard, and Chefarzt clinic at Heidelberg, professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also positive, creative madness - is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has the so-called Oneiroide Erlebnisform Researched, a particular form of Traumartig modified Wachbewusstseins.
Oneiroide are Multi-dimensional, detailed Quasi-träume, the Erlebende for real and he also cannot distinguish from Wakefulness in Hindsight.
The Oneiroide Bewusstseinszustand emerging in Trauma- or extreme illness, for example Polyradikulitis-patienten, in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by Self- and Weltverlust, such as ongoing total Impotence, it replaces the Life-threatening reality by, an imaginary world, the reality is Decoupled, says Schmidt-degenhard.
A kind Grenzzustand between dream and hallucinations.
When Dealing with a situation in the reality is not possible, a Weltwechsel is taking place, but the reality is in the imagination.
An intensive form of Sinnstiftung and meaning in an Intolerable situation, the people own Gestaltungsfähigkeit, not submerged in a Bewusstseinsverlustes nothing.
Everything is real, later in memory
Also the Neue Kunsthistoriker Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-erlebnisse in his book "Herzwechsel" as a Bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his awareness after a Herzklappenoperation followed by Herztransplantation travel days, while his body on the care of maintaining the Status Quo.
Claussen visited a appears in a Selbstgeschaffene world foreign times and places: he is Bettlägerigen, old man on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot wake on his health.
He lives in early ages Nobles, drugs from blood.
Is a Greeks dragged on the motorcycle in his own country, surfing with his Spitalbett Firnschnee the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
It is entirely in the Imagined, everything is real, and later in the memory.
This travel for Claussen is completely different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
Quite in contrast to me are the memories from mental travel after years and in minor details Abundantly.
Clearer and more even than Erlebtes.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other Lebensweltlichen experience, the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard says.
Final analysis show Oneiroide psychoses, hallucinations, and Drogenrausch how fragile our internal Female external reality also are monitoring.
Any change of Bewusstseinszustandes, Summed the psychologist Castes, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which could also be Enriching.
The Schneeeinbruch come
Burda
Children should accept the publishing of 27 years
The new Verlagschef Kallen is an Intermediary: long term Hubert Burda give his company in the hands of his two children, he told the Mirror.
The holding will include 100 per cent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children.
Both children and Heirs with 27 years have the determination, to companies, said the 69-jährige mirror.
The details we have as a Precaution.
The question of whether they are involved in companies, only then.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot 7 500 staff his children Swallow, if they are not sufficiently capable.
This brings the children and the companies.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he withdraw the Vorstandsvorsitz from January, and Paul-bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
The 52-jährige Kallen is Burda Board since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later came with the field Treasury responsible for the Unternehmensvermögen and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for marketing abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time is no family at the Helm of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen sets, "10 to 15 years," Burda tide.
The holding should also continue to include 100 per cent of the family, said Burda.
With Regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda that even family are not safe from the sinking: "This was always families were caught by a Kapitalsucht absolutely Verspekuliert and thought that they could for very big players.
My strategy was never the case.
He had "never Weltmachtträume", Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want the player with 'time', these Shops have become too big.
The promises of Fonpeek
Peek is limited Äuβerst, a device with which we can only read his E-mails, without being able to see a possibility of certain Annexes or through Internet surfing.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame than the Time magazine to one of the products of the year.
It Straβe, is Unlikely, but the idea is still of interest, particularly for young people.
In contrast to the Smartphones costs very little Peek and has a very good Flat, for example, only half the price of the Flat of a Iphone.
After the company's success has seen it two new equipment placed on the market: one that is designed for Twitter, the other with a Lifelong Gratisservice for data, in contrast to the Peek, in which they must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and third version.
It has the same boundaries as his American Counterpart, however, a surprise.
The monthly Unterhaltspreis for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those with a Smartphone Travelling around the world, already know what it means to do without all the data have to be able to read his E-mails, soon be Ridden Roughshod over the border or desperately seeking a bar with Wifi (or a Verbindungsmöglichkeit with Fon).
The idea of roaming with Flat is incredibly Tempting and should already be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone already offering specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, need a Doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming for the whole of Europe were almost always Ignored.
Auβerhalb's own country has always afraid to read his E-mails and Rightly so.
That a small device as Fonpeek (where it is always surprised that it has the name Fon, although it has no Wifi / Wlan) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone and Slowly but Surely change must start to consider various ways, as they can use their network.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices is the Downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and Snags.
It is a Internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, namely the purchase, and not every month.
And that is Exactly what I want one day of Fonpeek, a Kaufmöglichkeit with Lifelong Internet as the Peek already in the US.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my E-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting, being able to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetischfarbe Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the Lieblingsfarbe the American first lady.
Was the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a Veil this colour and has the same colour Re-elected him in, without doubt, his second moment in his life to Accompany: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has very similar: Auβer models, on two occasions that it was almost the same colour - an excellent Grüngelb, the Clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and Cloak from the same Material- and helped them to do something Groβförmig Gesticktes or a Halskette.
It even goes so far that it Seemed, at first Sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided the same dress to wear on more than one Occasion.
However, are two different Clothes in the Stoffart, from which they are Produced.
At the Inauguration was a dress from power and one from Gemusterten including in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time Green Shoes with Halbhohen Paragraphs and the second time a Änhliches model, but Goldfarben.
Also the hair every time was different: the hair were on this Occasion than Haarkranz celebrate, the previous it open.
75% of working mothers because their maternity problems in the work received
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
To this result is the Csic survey conducted in cooperation with the Institute for Women "fertility and career women in Spain.
The survey of 9.737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career on the labour market on the grounds of maternity.
The study demonstrates that there are broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and if so, what type of work it.
Those of you who do Auβerhalb House no other work, only part-time work or a fixed contract, be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to Postpone the women with a strong jobs, particularly in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a strong employment bear their first child on average only 3.7 years after the Zusammenziehen, a number which increased to 4.1 years for women by employment, which took longer to achieve this and Zusammenziehen and have the first child until much later.
Auβerdem has the kind of work a Groβen influence on motherhood, Albeit less than the calendar in Empfängnisbereitschaft, "says the Csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, the age of marriage for women and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the poll is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child more, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be stated in women the same age.

Cowardly aggression
My 70 mother was walking through our district in the town of Fuenlabrada last week when, Suddenly, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years among your and our dog Herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, we have obtained from the Shelter and just six kilos, and then out of the blue missed two Fußtritte and injured him so hard you.
Our indignation we cannot capture in words, as we understand it, where since the Spass a cheap aggression against a small and Hilfloses animal, the course should be on the leash.
This is the Erstickungsanfall, a woman, walking the Cosy, Reprimanding, as these people because of the incident had wanted, she feared for her own life, as if such a Raving attacked a dog, he is perhaps the same with a woman, a child, an elderly or probably even with each, the Weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet areas at five o'clock in the afternoon in a perfectly normal Tuesday.
The dog has spent the whole day Geheult.
We have, of course, in a Nahgelegenen police charges Reimbursed, but we have serious Doubts as to whether this will create anything and to avoid any Prejudice from the outset, we would like only to make it clear that the Criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must deal with in the minds of these young people that you find a cheap fun attack on a Hilfloses animal, an animal that we love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of Helms
The Michelin Tyre, in cooperation with the Spanish foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs especially in the younger motorcyclists as both companies Bekanntgaben today.
This initiative will make to draw attention to the importance of Helmgebrauchs, because this is ultimately the only Schutzelement, the skull or even death in the event of a Motorradunfalls can prevent.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety, which includes "far more than just the design and manufacture of products, every day more secure" and further, that they also educational and informative nature, with other actions every day to come a step closer to that Goal.
This new campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' - is in a first phase posters about 500 Motorradwerkstätten, so as to achieve the Bestmöglichste spread.
At the end of Michelin, stressed that the safety of the company is "a constant concern, and it is precisely for the reason that they are manufacturers of tyres for Zwei-rädige vehicles always obliged to see which one of its main objectives must be the development of Safer products.
The sale of vans rising again about
Almost two years after starting the car for vans is finally see light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles allowed in Spain in November, mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to the year 2008 and, more Importantly, they are the first ever increase for 22 consecutive months with practices, Gemäβ the Constructors Anfac and the Autohändlerverband Ganvam presented figures.
However, these good figures are now only Groβer caution to Genieβen, used as the comparison Background in November 2008, that a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a reduction of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must bear in Mind that, apart from the rise in the last month, Gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40% lower than the previous financial sales.
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles sold in this figure are all vehicles, from which the Kleintransportermarkt contain: descendants of cars, Pick-ups, vans, small vans and Lighter vans / chassis.
Also are still the same storm clouds in the sky, which affected the most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles should be bought by individuals, the Groβteil sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, in almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a Drittfinanzierung.
So we have to these restrictions, which the Zugedrehten stopping Einschlieβen of credit institutions, other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate and the persistence of poor economic situation.
In this situation and, unlike the cars, have the financial support the plan 2000e helped when buying a car.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, self-employed and small businesses have a right to a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a Co2-ausstoss, must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre trips Wishing to purchase, but low sales speak for themselves.
Again just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it is Imperative on the part of the state, is also a special attention to these Kleinlaster and, of course, to the Industriefahrzeuge (trucks and buses).
The Autohändlervereinigung Predicts a similar year for the year 2010 as the last, for which it Verkaufsausfall (with cars and Suv expects) by 19%.
The support Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As had been Antiblockierbremssystem (and as it happened with the stability control Esc, the Hilfssysteme must the emergency brakes in a Pflichtausstattung in European cars.
Indeed, they are duty on all new passenger cars and light Kleintransportern, for the remaining vehicles was Karenzfrist set by the end of February 2011.
The objective of the European Union Maβnahme has decided to improve the protection of Fuβgänger, but can also help this brake because of their operation, to prevent many Front-rear.
The task of Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers, which outlined the system by the drivers Bremsstärke on the pedal Recognises.
But does this pressure not to conclude from this system.
According to a study Commissioned by the Komponentenhersteller for the Bosch-fahrzeuge, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss no longer come to on the pedal and half of them had not prevented with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe Addresses with maximum force in the braking and reduced the Bremszeit and thus also the Bremsabstand, a car in Bremsvorgang truck.
According to a study by the EU could up to 1,100 fatal accidents every year, which Fuβgänger will prevent harm to come to, if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten.
There would be even fewer accidents -, it is estimated that every fourth accident and injury could be prevented when the so-called smart Notbremssysteme popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that Recognises (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, and we already have a Slight pressure on the brakes.
If the drivers then responded, Helps the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if necessary.
If the driver not to respond to the warning and even if the Zusammenstoss is Unavoidable, the Bremsassistent does the maximum pressure on the brakes in order in this way the damage to be kept as low as possible.
General Motors the plan for Opel to January
While the workforce of the Opel-werks by Nick Reilly in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, we were informed that the production of new Meriva will start in the first Aprilwoche, probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturers points out that he needs more time to complete for rescue Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, will in fact ensure that the affected side to any single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that in the final document, the first the workers and the governments of the countries in which it works, is presented, will Postpone until early 2010.
Dementgegen assured from GM that it will in the next few days will take a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American Energy-efficient, so that it makes a decision as soon as possible.
GM with some possible new buyers are in contact.
One of the buyers could be Geely, also like buying Volvo would, however, the option of Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sportwagen, has the Backing of the Russian group Converg, increasing.
If none of these buyers to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision, Schlieβen Saab by the end of the year if it had not been sold, will also continue.
At the Helm of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive Jewel engineers used the Boxster's as the basis and really managed to make it Easier to 80 kilos, which he now only 1.275 kg weight.
To create about, Abandoning the first of the automatic Aufklappbare roof by a Zeltleinwanddach has replaced, with Manuellem drive Alone has 21 kg; thanks to the savings in this model used Aluminiumtüren as the Gt3 "disappearance" further 15; by Excluding the air Conditioning time 13; Auβerdem, Kraftstofftank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, it saved another 7 kg; the installation of Sporting Bacquet-sitzen time 12 and in the light 19-zoll-felgen saved five.
Then there had been by the Foregoing the Audio-system Cdr-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of the Türgriffe Interfere in substance the lack of kilo.
Although he has with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe Pdk is available, the Ride in a car with 6-gängigen Handgetriebe carried out mainly on smaller Landstraβen of California, Bergstrecken, the really Kurvig.
In his behaviour can give him the score perfectly.
To reduce its weight, but not Geführtdass he now no longer so sure would be on the Straβe.
Rather, the opposite is the case: it for long, we no longer have a small and easy model Probegefahren, but also a sense of Groβer security at the Curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to Flex its muscles with a low tide in the time needed to make warm until we give him Orders, Grass, brakes, to recover and then again to get everything from his engine...
He makes everything, what he says the car makes everything, indicate what we with our hands at the wheel, thanks to its control, is communicative and Precise.
And it is doing so with the precision of a surgeon.
A Motorsound for all Tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 Horsepower (10 more than the Boxster) is very good and it can increase it even with the 'sport' and by means of a system that the Motorgeräusche Least-cost can change the Panamera, which already has been applied for the first time.
The Beschleunigungsvermögen is Inconceivable are brutal, regardless of whether the or when speed.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or Inconvenient.
The Asphalt on the Landstraβen, on which the Boxster Spyder, quite damaged, but the car was Meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants had virtually nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we in some of these Curves and Rollsplitt ice in the morning.
Summary we can say that it is a Ultraleichtes car, a car with a Indescribable Fahrspass otherwise, as it Surely rather rare and it is much more than just a Slight improvement of Boxster Ss.
The car is coming on to the market in February 2010 and 70.831 cost EUR.

More Disadvantages

After the Glowing days since last spring, in which inflation of assets the Prevailing mood in the markets was, returned the uncertainty in the markets, which in any case is Hardly surprising, since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the Broker decisions about a Inherently uncertain future.
It was the Maβnahme applied to Stabilise the markets, to Settle the debt with the Direktkauf of assets and indirectly the liquidity free to move to the zero interest rates, so that in this way the banks claim assets to buy.
The central banks have already confirmed that the Direktkäufe of assets as well as end and, without calling into question their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to throw a Spanner, as the Bce Näc Vormachte with their Jahresversteigerung, which takes place next week.
Why investors doubt the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without this heterodox Maβnahmen maintain and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten of markets and the differences in the Unternehmensboni rise again, even if they are far removed from the Paranormalen amounts that you made at the beginning of the year.
The States felt forced to Nationalize the private risks and the debt rise again.
It is now back on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred Haven of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the Euro-area countries with Regard to Germany.
Spain has until now little affected by this episode of instability, but then came the Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review, concerning the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand not hamper a degree of uncertainty, to put a stop to the defenders of the moral hazard, the once again tried, to the leaders of Policy-making an awareness, for what they had caused to Produce, as the Devastating effects that the Restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs, slowed when they Actually a new day for Dankesaktion Beschlieβen should have.
There is, however, what has happened in Dubai, a Stammeskrieg between the Emiren for power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also Foreseen earlier.
A government which the debt, elections and a new government, on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi Durão Barroso and Socrates in Portugal.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year of their application Auslandszahlungen and therefore allows a Euro-mitgliedsland, meet its obligations no longer.
It is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be Transparent and its citizens in need of Auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with the obligation to take in order to maintain the stability of the state funds.
Yes, we are as expected of an episode of Normalization of premiums, according to some excesses to high levels, would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain must be not to worry, as long as the differences of debt with the same speed as the European Unternehmensboni increase.
But should reduce the European differences and the Spanish continues to increase, Dannn this is a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators a Groβteil Marktforschungsinstitute, their forward Scenarios for the recovery and to correct Einschlieβlich scenario for 2011 Upwards of Ocde and of the European Commission with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy come all the promises despite Warnings not long life.
Once again, it is the appearance that it was an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although the moment "caution when" is needed.

The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, acting as first yesterday before the Subcommittee of the House to where in these days, the Spanish Strategy for the energy debate in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the Chairman of gas Natural-fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed, the press some Stichpunkte Galán about what he had made the Subcommittee behind Versschlossenen doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround invest 60 billion more from that date until 2030, Entails that the current nuclear power stations also remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, would the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase of capacity, but in distribution and international Groupings.
From 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
This proposal focuses both on gas and Kohlewerke with Facilities for capture of carbon dioxide and particularly, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is assumed that 18,000 Megawatts more are needed, under the Vorraussetzungnatürlich Stützenergien "by others.
Galán, is of the view that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which was adopted by the Government in particular, which is in line with what his company, did not say anything about this law, how to create incentives for the national Kohleverbrauch what Exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
His view, 'in the long term it is clear in this direction, despite some "individual" Maβnahmen, described as the Chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Galán, believes that we have the decisions on investment, even if they are long term, should make, because it will take some time and a stable package must be created to tackle it.

Acciona Competes with Hochtief and Bouygues his first motorways in Australia
Acciona fighting for Granting his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water.
The construction, which it is, is a tunnel, 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 will cost EUR billion).
The French company Bouygues and German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona as construction in the country, and to establish Autobahnbetreiber.
The city would have completed the construction by the end of 2014.
After the administration is English Abbreviation for Public-private Partnership (PPP) had decided to set the project within one of Ernst & young business plan, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and Mautstellenverwaltung.
In Anticipation of the offers presented in May estimated investment Amounted to EUR 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion), although in the last phase three consortia, particularly European construction, Compete with each other.
The group called Transcity led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are Bmd and Ghella.
The first company is one of the Gröβten construction Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best Tiefbau specialists.
Against the team of Acciona the consortium Northern direct formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Baugruppe Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, the closer the election is called, Lbrjv, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German Bauunternehmens Hochtief, which in turn to ACS), also local Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which Specializes in the public building.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises Tremendous work and privatisation, but has a Hurdle to which it applies, as it is through the purchase of a local Bauunternehmens access.
A strategy, the companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian Credentials, are followed, and the Spanish Baugiganten yet must be pursued.
ACS has in this market only through its own participation of 30% Hochtief, owner of the Leighton, gained access.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the Utmost importance in this geographical area for the industry, which has already given his role as an energy supplier, and Entsalzungsindustrie is very well known.
Under other assets has already Gröβten Windmühlenpark (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies, which was entrusted with the Entsalzungsanlage of Adelaide with a budget of EUR 700 million to build and manage.
Its intention is now to these two areas to consolidate and build on these synergies in order to gain access to the arms construction and infrastructure.
The underground Mautstrecke, through the office of infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and Northern link (Nordzubringer) Heiβen has the purpose to the Western motorway in Toowong with the Umgehungstraβe Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels together. It is the Gröβte Maβnahme to Staureduzierung on the Straβen of Brisbane.
The city spent road map provides the Allocation for summer 2010 and the start of construction in December next year.
Even if this Mautstrecke already open to traffic in recent months by 2014 is to assume that the construction work will continue until 2016.
