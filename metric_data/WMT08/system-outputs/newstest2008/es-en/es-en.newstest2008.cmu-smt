Gallup provides a government crisis

The difference in the case of voters sure parties - due to the greater firmness voters the opposition - would mean a support of more than two-thirds (a 71%) vis-à-vis the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Liberals Libres or the limit will not to have any parliamentary escano : its support within the entire population is 2%.
Among voters are safe one percent over sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the previous nadir - has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who judged particularly bad the country's economic plight, while another 46% believes that the situation is very poor.
Families, after expectations more hopeful spring and summer, are now more pessimistic in exchange for their own economic situation.
With regard to the next ano , the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth expected an improvement.
In December 71% of those questioned, figure than any previous Gallup poll, thought that the President of government desempena more harm than good their functions.
The 13% of those questioned hopes or relies heavily in Ferenc Gyurcsány, Viktor Orbán supported by the 38% of those questioned.
A 54% of the population has no confidence in absolute terms in the head of government and a 27% does not trust the president of the Alliance Young Democrats.
One indicators of shaping the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to monitor discontent experienced vis-à-vis the person of Prime Minister without a change of government.

The more expensive is the Auchan , Tesco has five times what they were their prices
Mantuvieron increasing the average price levels of a 16% supermarkets commercial triangle gold Budaörs , with the difference that this ano has not increased VAT.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This ano also grew at an average of 16% in the commercial triangle gold Budaörs the usual canasta Christmas of everyday Napi , but in all supermarkets growth recorded a much higher than the thousand HUF .
As in December of last ano had already been fired "" prices in supermarkets food, this is not experienced a dramatic increase in comparison with the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers the fact that what the last ano could buy a price below the nine thousand HUF , today it can do or ten thousand.
The canasta of Napi in supermarkets studied surpassed with a minimum of 1991 HUF limit the psychological ten thousand HUF .
And canasta the highest value was 10 573 HUF .
ano (in 2003 that canasta 6800 cost HUF .)
The price of spirits Unicum and fish remained almost at the previous ano , but there was a sharp increase in pechuga steak goose of nuts, and the seeds of poppy.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Statistics Office, but also Auchan have found a kilogram of bread for the price of 138 HUF .
Competition not reduced the product price unless 200 HUF .
It was also surprising in this shop than the price of Coca-Cola with bottle redimible gallons of two cost less than 200 HUF , so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, was only 257 HUF .
Yet, in the canasta of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while the Cora cheaper.
According to our calculations, with regard to prices Christmas of ano past, Cora increased with a 15, while Tesco and Auchan with around 18% prices contained in the canasta of Napi .
Comparing the values of canasta 's most expensive ano past with the canasta cheaper this ano , the difference was a 12%, while growth between the cheapest of ano past and more expensive this ano has been a 21%.
The average growth was 1480 HUF .
The ano past the average growth in prices was of 1206 HUF , so that during the last Christmas ano prices were increase VAT.
Precisely this process was that tore trade, supermarkets visibly were incapable of taking decision on the margin of prices to apply for each product and calculating the effect of changing prices on consumption.
(If trader planning badly the speed of the movement of a product, may lose an important profit margin the turnover.)
The increase in the price of canasta of Napi extremes reached such as a result of increasing VAT, which was the most expensive superior HUF 1720 value recorded in 2006, while in the cheaper difference was just one 844 HUF .
This ano not occur such extremes, since the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than the ano past and cheaper also increased with HUF 1284.
Comparing the two seasons navidenas , recorded a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months and supermarkets grew more than 30% commodity prices.
(But this does not necessarily confirms the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some basic foodstuffs recorded in the interval 12 months increased price over 30%.
For example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the canasta of Napi , in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because the price of this product that was quite expensive because the ano past compared to the basis, recorded, at worst a mere 10% increase in prices.
By all indices, suppliers of flour have a stronger position that the egg and impose the dramatic increase in prices even multinationals.
The supermarkets not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, constantly talking about positive results.
According to our experience, the majority of consumers of the three shops visited, no longer care about prices.
In all products buy large amounts, drawing on paletas food preserved.
In the manana on Wednesday, in the three major shops formed tails ahead of boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, have information that inside the country volumes of sale are lower, many multinationals complain institutes survey because incomes fall below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also of the electrical.
In many hospitals saves with the disinfectants
This ano have occurred in hospitals several thousand infections produced at first by the misuse of antibiotics.
Circumstances hygiene pervade hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload the staff not encourage control of infections - states médica-jefa department of the National Centre for Epidemiología .
In many hospitals saves even with the disinfectants.
Not long ago has been diagnosed with MRSA isolates contagion department of traumatología of János Hospital.
In a man admitted after a serious accident were found the bacterium resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same sort of infection occurred in this hospital at the beginning of ano .
In a wounded a serious car accident gave the hospital and high shortly after the same patient should return to hospital consequence of the infection with MRSA isolates and since then has been a major surgery for the presence of bacterium in his body.
Until the 10 December this ano have occurred in Nosocomialis National System Surveillance 1094 cases of infection hospital produced by agents multi-resistant - said Karolina Böröcz , médica-jefa department of National Centre for Epidemiología .
This means that in hospitals surely recorded this amount of infections caused by multi-resistant agents, the rest is not information.
Roughly two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA isolates, i.e., the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to meticilina-oxacilina .
A third of human beings bear in their nose bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (Company) without any cause disease.
Infection produced by the Company (for example: swelling Gorge, amigdalitis infections, skin infections, wounds) react well to antibiotics and are easily treatment.
However, once applied exaggerated or wrongly to antibiotics, bacteria usually react well to antibiotics, become very antibiotic-resistant bacteria and spread rapidly in hospital conditions inadequate.
They can cause serious infections, for example, hospital infections wounds or blood poisoning first patients with transitional immunodeficiency or chronic, patients with weakened body, or the elderly people of little weight.
In view of the médico-director Hospital János nothing in particular infection of MRSA isolates, these infections are in hospitals.
must not be confused with the epidemic, the infection MRSA isolates only is absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where is not examined its presence.
Resistente to antibiotics
These patients are "isolated, nursing staff takes them and rubber kid mask and exist antibiotics suitable for treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi .
The patients hospitalized are examined in advance to verify the presence of MRSA isolates in his body, but even can be avoided infection in all cases.
It is fashionable sample
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA isolates in most cases, however present circumstances national hospital are not conducive to prevent the formation and contagion with pathogens multi-resistant - states Karolina Böröcz .
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and homes homes, hospitals should examine patients hospitalized and isolate immediately the enfermes who have their MRSA isolates the body.
However, in hospitals Hungarians is not fashionable micro-biological sampling.
This is also because the National Public does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases go in public when there are already visible in MRSA isolates infections of the patient - said of the médica-jefa department of central epidemiological.
The European Union is to encomiendas rigorous application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
We must empenarse that therapy with antibiotic directed, i.e., should be done to prevent microbiological examinations resistance to medicines, but hospitals not fulfilling this demand.
Decision-making micro-biological samples are even less prevalent in the case of patients mobile or basic health care - stated Karolina Böröcz .
This saves with the disinfectants
Experiments scientists have shown that in most cases are MRSA isolates infectious a patient to another through health workers.
Therefore, desempenan laundering an important role in the hands, the use of kid rubber and masks, but also in this respect are experiencing considerable mistakes in hospitals.
The MRSA isolates will spread by transmission by drops and direct contact between people, however in circumstances national hospital is not always possible to isolate the patient infected.
Moreover, rooms hospitals are often overcrowded, beds are often very together, but to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it may experience also - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals less favourable economic situation saves with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and why there is a greater chance to infection.
In view of Karolina Böröcz , where the appropriate preventive measures, are less infections of this kind or can stop the transmission of agent.
governmental Programme against MRSA isolates
The treatment of infection with MRSA isolates is huge spending for the National Endowment for Enfermedad Insurance, so that all countries will fight against him.
In Britain, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA isolates.
Apparently the programme has successes, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA isolates show trend of reduction in England.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) has among its priorities preventing multi-resistant agents (between these the MRSA isolates) and hospital infections are due to these pathogens.

Fodor and the six hundreds Hungarians
According to reported the Environment Minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor meetings be completed by experts Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime post-2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberating about Roadmap available on the efforts of Balí after the period of reducing emissions, established in the Kyoto Protocol, valid until 2012.
At present conducted animated discussions about the particular among developing countries and industrial countries.
America has already indicated that it wants to negotiate on accurate figures, although tends to reach the agreement that in comparison with the situation in 1990, until ano 2020 undercuts with a 25 to 40% emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for the.
Another major issue of the conference is that if the industrialised countries, and reduce emissions, or are not prepared to give material support and technological to countries that need it.
It was also an agreement on aid to offer to developing countries.
The support fund, under the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a board of direction composed of 16 members, probably within the Global Fund to the UN Environment (GEF ) - writes the "Piac és Profit ."
The six by hundreds of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, the Environment Minister and Hidrología Gábor Fodor supports EU efforts to maintain its leading role in the global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU undertakes reduce until 2020, with regard to 1990 levels in 20% their emissions of greenhouse gas, responsible for the, regardless of whether or not to be signed the post-2012 "and" agreement is ready to engage in reducing even 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also prepared to accept commitments under their responsibility and their skills.
Gábor noted that Fodor signatories of the Kyoto Protocol 1997 undertook to decrease in a 5.2%, within this then 15 EU Member States undertook to meet an 8% reduction.
The compromise in Hungary is decreasing with a 6% emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for the in the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will senala - the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
Much is at stake in Balí , since within two years will sign the international agreement of the long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that their entry into force would continue after 2012. In this case reduction commitments undertaken in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately followed by a new international system of reducing emissions, whose need was perceived in its most recent report by the IPCC, scientific partnership UN international deals with climate change, which received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Thus, reducing emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of more than 2o C of the temperature of the earth, according to the scientists have untold and irreversible consequences.
The British army in YouTube recruited
The British army units in a video recordings distributor of published on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize indexed themselves.
First the British air force (RAD ) was exploited YouTube services: displaced special units in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are burdened videos on their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras riding helmets monitors in the body general Kandahar operations, then send London to be levied by the Internet.
Inevitably, the political message
We are 138 recordings from air force soldiers who have been charged the Internet and its "channel" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence recorded in the spring of 2007, under the name of "defence named" and publishes videos both actions dotted in Iraq and Afghanistan, meanwhile the Ministry of the Community (United British Commonwealth Office) as multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI ) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally air force was charged with the videos recruitment objectives, but in view of the Ministry of Defence also help to show the public the real purpose of the presence of the British army abroad.
Such propaganda virtually costs nothing in comparison with the conventional TV spots recruiting - told the BBC the expert in defence Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably have any political message, since in a specific manner justify the raison d'être of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans produced a videogame
The army is also concerned about by the fact that, in addition to recelosamente recordings and abrogated published in the distributor appear also videos fans, for example on the death of soldiers: the official "propaganda films," somewhat hypocritical, officers talk as maximum losses, without presenting however the bloody part of fighting.
Moreover, the battlefields Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet numerous videos engraved in real operations, but the British army only recently is taking this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly differently for recruitment with the descargables gratuitously shot Video so-called America's Army, where in the midst of a situation more or less genuine player can be directly instead of soldiers.

This means that - in the parliamentary vote on the law of public health - not reported on the date of the end of the strike begun.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the law of public health, unions retire immediately her appeal to strike.
Instead, if approved the law, will meet strike committees and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda on Monday of the National Assembly is also possible that only vote on the law of public health in the hours very inflows of night, or perhaps nearly midnight.
As a result of the strike beginning on Monday, we must reckon with significant difficulties in transport: railways will work indefinitely, by the manana may stop part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the local transport bus Volán drug.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country will closure of half of the ways of roads.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names constantly updated in the League website.

In the country: Political Capital increases the risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to Division Academic (Risk Analysing Division ) Capital Political activity Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this ano with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from various views has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the "warning about risks" companía it says: in connection with the operation of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the escalation of ethnic tensions between the Roma population and Roma Hungary, not even in the short term" violent ethnic conflict will occur.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They said that all this is one of the main players Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave him public discussion of the Roma problem representatives of the political groupings radical extremists, who could establish his political strategy on the discrepancy between Roma and Hungarian."
This makes the problem, prevents any normal dialogue, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - estimates.
Beyond that, according to the research institute, the National Guard, by consequence of the great attention to the national average and international failed "significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially in regard to stability and democratic development of the country."
We remember that: from otono 2006 received increasing openness and momentum reorganization of radical groups and right-wing Hungary and since the summer of 2007 were formed in the country numerous organizations they associations of self "national".
"The common feature of these bodies is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaim training of its members to defend armed - even - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), citing the own inadequacies of the police, the army, namely the State" - add.
They said: all this occurs in accordance with the method that seeks to give a civilian presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent with politics and society with political parties.
Because highlight civil and form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of the legal status, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard activity is a risk factor also in terms of relations between neighbours.
"In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the political figures ultra-nacionalistas certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own policy anti-húngara with the creation of the Hungarian Guard,.
All this influences political stability in the region "- added.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that throughout the region were increased political risks.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in such a way that, for example, the National Guard Búlgara , whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the National Union Búlgara (UNB far-right).
The constitution must guard Bulgarian to massive gypsies riots that occurred in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poliana ).
With this situation, the UNB decided to form the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national self."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years was "Roma terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
Agregaron : this initiative provoked a animated discussion in the Bulgarian public.
As wrote, indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain organizations Gypsy Bulgaria have announced that to resist, form its own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard hitherto has shown similarities with the National Guard Búlgara , cannot be excluded also gypsies Hungary reacting to the threat in a similar way, organizing its own self - can read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The head of investigations Political Capital, Attila Juhász to the question news agency said: risk analysis is one of the activities of research institute.
As each ano published its risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk, to inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing its warning on risks.
The party are not always writes with red
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days write with red timetable and has now become a practice that around the holidays - that the ano ahead will be less - reorganise themselves working days.
Even in the EU or in America are uniform parties.
Laws Hungarian make a difference between national holiday celebration of state and solemn hours.
The solemn hours essentially relate to religious festivities and historical anniversaries.
Festejamos the New Ano also: both the last ano old, as the first day of ano new is celebrated the latter - especially to those who became the rest festejando ano old.
Throughout the ano have eleven Christmas written with red schedule.
It is national holiday 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, memorial hours of 1956 revolution.
The 20 August welcome the founding of the State, the 1o May the feast of work, the 1o and 2o November remember our family and friends deceased.
Furthermore, we are celebrating two days of Resurrección Easter Sunday, and the Christmas.
According to the timetable, our state holidays, national or religious seldom coincide with a weekend, why is often bridge when sooner or later of the party is one workweek.
In exchange for weekends alargados , over the previous Saturday cannot leave the job or school.
It is the minister regulating working in their specific decree when exactly change working hours precedent directly or after the party.
This rule of law is compulsory for all employers and for their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is compulsory in exchange for companies and institutions of services, owing to its role, even during the solemn ceaselessly working hours.
This ano order can work only altered festivities around the end of ano : from 24 December virtually stops life in the country, because according to experience, most people "bridge" during the days ago between Christmas and the end of ano or take their vacations during these days.
The next ano number of our Christmas coincide with the middle or weekend, and less changes in working hours that this ano .
First will change the agenda on the feast of work and then, successive four-day can rest workers.
The Saturday, 26 April workday will, in exchange for Friday 2 May is festive hours.
The other change is associated with the feast of 23 October: Saturday 18 October, we must work instead of Friday 24.
Instead, the next ano during the party in order to ano be rest, since from 24 December will not be almost nowhere, even if the last ano is a Wednesday.

Pierdes interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual backlog of the manana .
Sounds a compass extrano radio: violin with electronic effects.
Subo volume.
Cambia the pace of music and the previous tones builds low and then the voice of a female chorus as genuine jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel reproduces the song Wings of Love of Zagar .
Life national musical us not malcrió much with electronic pop quality.
But now seems totally different this backlog when you are listening the new records of Zagar .
It Yonderboi . Some songs new and interesting of national digital underground are gradually changing the picture, although it is fashionable again rock garages style, breaks guitarras , electro national pop has shown: innovations are under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began their careers in the city of Pécs fell, throughout Yonderboi until began their careers independent perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of one.
With his project (Zagar ) and their music, a mixture of jazz bailable pop music, and electronics, tried to succeed, when asked soundtracks (pl cinema.
Török Ferenc Szezon ).
The wider public knew that the whole initially acted only in clubs pequenos when the magazine wan2 selected its first disk published in 2002 among the most important national fifty records, classifying Zagar , together with Yonderboi almost as the only national centre of trends, capable of sold in western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and a whole are fashionable, but nobody asked whether or not willingly this label.
The whole reacted as must react: disk produced a new and even better.
The newly launched disc entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself seeks to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs .
Because this title was one of the lines of the whole of former Balázs Zságer .
Fine reference about him, on the flight, but also the best of music, now appeared - in the spirit and fashionable - the guitarra that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs disk presented in the Millenáris György Ligeti , the singer currently employed in England with all the Puzzle .
In the disk includes a real success channel mr2 Petõfi that recently transmitted the manana night popular music. This broadcaster led to the ears of the radioyentes music high flight from Wings of Love engraved, with six Hungarian singing ($ivas Underground ").
Because everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer .
hvg.hu : After this new success the question arises that you are interpreting, to what extent is a music devoted to a selected public?
Balázs Zságer : The definition of selected public means little for me.
In my view, two types of castes music slight; not mainstream and underground , but no alternative pop and commercial and sincere.
The so-called music underground alternative can be boring, without sense and can be made up equally only for sale, what makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from an inspiration sincere.
The attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu : see any difference between the reception of your music by the public and Hungarian abroad?
B. Zs : In abroad, especially the west of us, music slight has larger traditions.
This does not only generations of fifteen twenty years and frequent concerts, but also the old.
They pay more attention to the changes in their midst music slight, because they believe it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu : What role has the public in your job?
Do you matter who are, where and how many are those following your music?
Naturally, I am well B.Zs : to see ever more people attends our concerts.
But we have never composed music to the market.
We music for some odd goal, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather feels in concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only changes inconceivable.
Yet I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
hvg.hu : How pretendes follow the example of Yonderboi ?
He works alone and made his career rather the west of us.
B.Zs : We do not accept their way, despite the fact that sometimes try to compare our music with him.
We rather work in team, trust the presence of another musical and leaving to unfold.
Initially was inevitable to compare our work with the Yonderboi music, as many of us we started our career in his group and hence embraced another route.
hvg.hu : In the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard for the first time on behalf of Zagar regarding this song.
How Abriste concientemente with this style towards a broader layer?
Zs.B. : There intended putting great successes and sell our disk with these successes.
This song is more than that.
The agregamos at the end of the disk, trying to relax after resonant orgy of records and heavier issues.
hvg.hu : How has chosen the six singing?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs : The idea was to create a chorus gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of solistas good voice of our own national musical scenario.
This was created this chorus of six women - i.e., Kutzora Seine Edina , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enikõ Hodosi
hvg.hu : Compusiste exactly the song or girls changed some things?
This Zs.B. : song existed long ago when instrumental in version and had all the material the, believe that there is something.
The commensurate atraía the edge.
Even that night recorded it the song later the learned girls.
All the virtually came first attempt and spontaneous incredibly way.
I remember, I entusiasmaba much then naturally needed, but also the Divas .
With my voice had not worked so strength.
Both hvg.hu : in concert and disk girls seems as if they were in the background.
There is solistas (except the brief only Judy Jay ), are not sing own role, all together and not more sharply than music, so that music not only acompana their chanting.
In the scene belong in substance.
Whether wilfully do?
B.Zs : they are basically simply by technical problems.
Instead deliberately wanted to distribute roles of solistas .
The song is about is now forget that our egos who where, which has been and where, let because that those wings, the wings of love lift us.
It wanted to ensure that other felt that mood euphoric us when we started this song.
Each hvg.hu : dedicaste more work?
Zs.B. : In music composition actually no rather when mixing spare was more difficult.
For example Dorian Gray's Dilemma that I am playing in a piano together or Rock 'N'Djamena Roll Goes To The Girls , where for a long time groove did not work, and then gradually all began to its place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu : What is your preferred song in the new disk?
This Zs.B. : ever-changing with concerts and because I have "unleashed disk".
Now the Prophet Is In Fool , Escape From The Earth and Never The Same .
A treacherous corridor risks stockbrokers billions on his inferiority complex
A malversador unfair.
This is as its former employee, Jerome Kerviel banker, the giant French Société Générale owner, the Bank of Commerce Czech.
For him lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than Kerviel was a major player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues, and certainly with good capacities.
Intuyó long ago, unlike all large banks Czechs, the crisis in the market for American mortgages.
"It was a fragile nature" hear of their superiors, those who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from the answers Kerviel according to show what the French media, as Le Monde, is that it was a man who late last year had a gain more than 600 million thanks to their business.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything was wanted to earn money for my bank" ensures in their responses.
In the summer, managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million.
This opportunity already saw come earlier this year.
In February began to listen to some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had difficulty with payments and that these customers start in trouble.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel it thought and gambled correctly.
Then, at the end of the year their earnings outstripped the 1.6 million.
"When my first 500 million gané already knew not notified as" Kerviel admits, and adds that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation declared that had distorted records so that it was not his discovery.
Even came to mislead bosses, even if the stock market Eurex began to consider their business.
The risk became benefit
Can I was afraid to come to discover?
Rather, not.
"I thought it earned 1.6 million for the bank and from that simple fact that they would be happy."
Where brought so willing to risk in this way?
In my position is gradually should work.
It has been to work in Société Générale in 2000, exactly after close to study in Lyon.
His annual wage would be handled between the 51 dollars.
Two years after was already assistant Stock row and in 2005 row became bag with an annual wage 90,000 of dollars.
Still knew that was never going to win than the others.
"In my first interview in 2005 already noticed that I looked carefully.
Because of my training and also my personal and professional advancement "described Kerviel researchers.
But time my entry into the company came first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title 500 million.
This was a mechanism of grubbing, and wanted more.
If you want, we
"It is as a snowball" said the police.
But it is said that bosses knew all this or that it sospechaban .
While money "earned chief blind."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In a lost billion.
After the weekend half January wanted to remove all mark.
When the Monday came to work, no longer working on the bank.
And two dias later, the bank announced that he had lost 5 million his fault.
And how localizarle managed?
This became suspect from their holiday.
"Elegí only four dias by the year.
The corridor, which has no holiday is a corridor, which does not want anyone to a look at his dossier "Kerviel ended.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion (approximately 365 billion).
It is practicamente half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can gain from Brussels for the years 2007-2013.
The seven operational programmes will approximately 125 billion for regions.
The Czech companies can get around 100 billion of the and innovation.
Most of the money will be intended to transport, until 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the greatest operational programmes and represents until 22% of resources that the Czech Republic can achieve.
This money increases the budget of state fund for transport infrastructure that next year boast the amount of 90.800 billion.
The programme Enterprise and innovation should serve employers and companies to obtain resources in innovation of business.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for implementing organizational methods more effective.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recien formerly seized less that use them.
Death twenty years for the former Nicaragua, declared the court
The Court of Apelaciones Nicaragua declared tomorrow worth 20 years for the former President of the country which, Arnoldo Alemán, which was doomed in 2003 by the defalcation $100 billion (almost 1.8 billion).
Despite this, following a time, was released from prison to move to house arrest in their estates not far metrópili Nicaragua.
There is no clear at the moment, according to the PA agency, the then Chief of American between 1197 and 2002, back behind bars.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Apelaciones , Ileana Peres will depend rather penitentiary agents if left to end his German punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed as constantly traspasaba German government money to account of a company in Pánama .
This was society fictitious and account belonged, in reality, his family and more cercanosT supporters.
Part of this money ended the German fund that created to finance its campaign in elections in 2001.
So we approved the budget
That is.
The budget of State was adopted.
Why is this particular budget?
It is the first produced by the government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget this year was agreed with the support of ČSSD , because it paved the Sobotka minister and ČSSD could not afford not accept.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in government, this time, not happened dramatic.
The parliament, in traditional this view, although the most influential calmly approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government starts and ends with each heading and budget line, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but it is power rivalry between government and opposition.
It is important for comunicacón media and therefore may devote special attention.
Discussions policies are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The state budgets of recent governments social-democratic suffered three defects that for this year 2008 cannot be solved so facilmente :
The first is the high turnout of laws mandatory, so-called spending as leaders who are not only pensions but also social benefits that last year were adopted before the election by the silent "and" coalition of ČSSD KSČM .
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third is the deficit ceiling of public funding, as the budget deficit and municipal Community.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the budget deficit of the state.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the budget deficit and municipal Community.
Many mayors to obtain other sources of investment, apart from taxpayers' money, rates and loans from the banks, often issued, mindless obligations with whom borrowed disproportionately their councils.
In recent years managed to pay these debts through the sell-off energy actions and other networks of development that received the state and privatization.
We do not have this resource.
If we stick only the official facts verified and we discovered that:
Our economy, a few years ago, passes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, what boasts ČSSD .
This was the ideal occasion for his government an order to state finances.
However, instead the state followed borrow.
The rest of formerly, except for a few as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economizaron much more reasonably for our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially in the previous government.
We have nations within the global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why not require massive social programmes, unfortunately, in recent years inutilmente measures are hincharon gigantic.
And although managed to eliminate the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if not changing shortly retirement age and pension reform that will be the end of any policy in this country which governs, and who governs will only be a mere bureaucracy.
To exaggerate somewhat cannot say that politicians governing be transformed into officials, mechanical delivery of most of taxpayers' money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but cannot stop the pressure of normal expenditure expenditure leaders.
The deficit planned over 70 billion to 2008 would have been entirely unnecessary if the government past had not wasted in the last ten years what could.
We want politicians who govern become only in officials must therefore be patient and give this weak coalition government, which realize that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and charges, peacefully to prepare for other reforms laws.
Only that will make the gradual achievement of a balanced budget for the state.

The want to solve the crisis banks
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks and Canadian Swiss British chose to fight together against the crisis of the finance ministers.
In the monetary Conformity will more than 100 billion dollars through licitaciónes .
In these tender banks auctioned off interest rates which are capable of providing money.
For example, the American Fed sent to bid 40 billion dollars, and then another 24 billion facilitate the central banks Swiss and of Europe.
After the September 11 attacks, is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this process coordinated to protect and reduce the consequences of the crisis of finances.
"This step must resolve the biggest economic problem, namely the contínuo growth of scarcity of free capital that banks could provide" wrote in his report for clients, Bernard Baumohl consultancy Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably decreased recession in the United States of a 65% to 50%" added Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already spent 60 billion dollars in unpaid appropriations, especially in the United States.
Economists ahead billions in losses.
"The central banks must really have fear what is still awaits when decided to take this step" said the chief economist of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies.
"It appears that the situation is truly evil" added.
The central banks fear that have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send to the American economy into recession with different impacts in the growth of the world economóa .
The central banks and decided, after not managed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, interbancaria tariff London used for the loan of money in the market system.
This means that banks constantly feared devote money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain reduced during the autumn its interest rates several times.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates" told the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio Tempus Consulting company.
Some economists are not surprised at the step by central banks contributes to inflame the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem is that the demise of the property market in the US.

Now stakeholders can be informed about their varied views.
Klaus reminded that is not a climatólogo but, in his opinion, assumptions as sufficient to write a book like this.
It is academic, with ability to follow and judge speak specialized has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the time of the main closing expressed its thought that climate change constantly, and its changes are normal on global warming that there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of climate are useless, ineffective and costosamente unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experimented with totalitarian regimes considered unacceptable impose opinions not tried to others, what is as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
In the questions here repeatedly explained that is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against militants ecologists that do not take account of the cost-benefit."
In the same issue in Vienna spoke Klaus two months ago in the Institute Hayek.

From that comical origin was a business and a lucrative business which Harabiš created after the Kingdom of Walachei society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed in using its name and signing in passports and even offered their holders discounts the vistantes for their farms and assistants to their shows.
Who sets in the throne?
The judge today also found that Harabiš used only a simple idea that Polívka issued in the stage for their own business profit.
Clearly Bolek "Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Walachei" said the judge.
He added, however, that the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team whom dedicated to this completely.
The cooperation between the parties, today descompuestas continued until 2000 when Harabiš arranged for Polívka the coronation official Vsetín .
Since then began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose completion came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the elected forever."
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš resulted in the singer Jarmila Šuláková , as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabiš and their society that until now has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in litigation tournament, by the throne with their princesses, which is now preparing Harabiš .
The he should leave the new king.
They wanted to reveal even more information or dates.
"There is no hurry.
It must be something like the path of King towards Czech.
The King should be chosen by a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka "can be added Harabiš .
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi prejudices overcome:
In truth I have never liked too the Peugeotu 206.
Its characteristics of march were never anything particular, the quality of manoeuvre changes, and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now exists in the market his successor, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi so-called SW is a little more advanced and to me, because I can only pensármelo better.
When probé the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, the area of the head in the back seat.
But this would only complaint because the body of Combi means in this respect, which will not suffer before the two metres.
Flying by the world
Step by the interior short to avoid repetition too.
This is an elegant design where the only failing is the poor central tunnel.
Here more consideration inventing design although the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are days when we quejábamos short of seats and securities.
Also unlike 206 model, the direction side has improved considerably.
And space, and here can be felt how measures have grown body.
In the Combi disappears this shortage of space on the head.
Maletas to boot
But the main in this vehicle is its boot.
This must appraisal as highly accessible (thanks to portón backyard flexible so that it can fold) and a distributed storage.
The dead spaces funding equipped with rubber easy to provide an ideal solution.
We nuisance, and can be extended to restrain heavy objects.
But us stand in the tank.
According to the tables in basic regime has a capacity for 428 gallons what compared with competition is rather an average.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type more sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi .
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, found that the Peugeot lags behind with their perceptible 52.
The holiday abroad or in placing the child buggy its value is critical.
But if I had to comment positive must cite the house that there is some level securities down after the second line.
120 horses marches in four
Our tested car was equipped with a encedido injection of four on a 1.6 l. valves capacity and a force of 88 kW.
To tell the truth as should seem a 1600 that menospreciara family the five doors.
It is rarely consumes little and, above all, has momentum.
If I compare with the era of škoda then seemed as if the exhaust pipe were taponado by an attack, I can say that this can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of car is not for all the pockets.
However, we must bear in mind that have tested a vehicle gracefully and equipped with a very good engine.
The basic price of car with lit injection of 1400 by 329.900 , it may still be.
Our aggregates put him from 410.900 , what is already too.
The kind Premium tested already at other 80,000 crown.
Only that tendriamos still in the air bag headwaters, air conditioning automatic, limpiaparabrisas automatic, traseras windows automated...
In other words, the car with all of all, 531.900 costs money.
It is much, but embraces the supplements team in Fabia and will reach far similar.
Now it is only opt for which the two brands.
Students Slovaks not integrate into English schools
In English attend school children formerly of Eastern Europe and therefore local people fear more changes in schools.
Integrating the East Europeans by now only entail a series of problems.
Even British schools recorded cases where conflicts between migrants and children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children of Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated in the northern city Kent where are starting to grow conflicts between the natives and migrants Slovaks.
Pointless discussions, estorsión and broncas between students have already reached even parents themselves.
Things have come so far that Chatmam police arrested Slovak a woman who was hitting sticks to a ten-year student with a green yardstick.
In its defence said that she was abused her son of sync with insults racist.
The police had to act also after a two-pronged attack against a migrant girls of age Slovak.
Girls agasajaron him with racist abuse and jettisoned stones.
"When home orientation, a boy climbed us towards stopping the bus and began to escupirnos .
When I said that he did not stop far apples, and then fell blue and showed us back its "described another unpleasant incident Times, for the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are both sides.
One of the natives even appointed the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe and fight for survival.
The cases mentioned earlier, show us as the environment in English schools begins to be fairly tense.
In Britain is registered 70 Slovaks came here for work.
An estimated 30,000 students Slovaks attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island Caribbean
For the vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything wait holiday cannot meet, provided that eliga correctly.
Playas sandy and gold, large waves or a sea as a pond.
All the palms and including waiters offering pizza in the beach, at a standstill or varied cocteles .
Kitesurfing , and golf lottery.
In the Caribbean Sea island can find all this and much more.
Only in an island is still far more and that island is Cuba, and the greater the finest of all islands of the Great West Indians.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
Havana became grocery and port of burden of that Spaniards extrajeron treasures of America and led to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew at the end of the 20 years.
What penned building one of the mafia bosses Lucky Luciano American, because everything that had crime in US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Their were invited, among other
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner Frank Sinatra.
In Havana arose buildings, high wide boulevards risked cars that were a symbol of religion in the 1950s last century.
Ernest Hemingway were purchased in San Francisco de finances Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar took its yacht.
In the walls of East Bodeguita left their signatures stars of the world arts and politicians throughout Latin.
And today?
In the walls of Bodeguita habanense you can also be left his autograph.
In the bar of expensive Hotel him the National mix cocktail according to their wishes.
And these cars of religion in the 1950s, until today are still running for Havana, because Lada Fiat and those who arrived long ago were corroded between these humid and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the old district is deteriorating dramatically, does not exist in the vicinity many wonderful colonial monuments as elsewhere.
Other metamorfosean in beautiful places, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings both necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years grew new hotels not only in Havana but also in Varadero , on the coast of the province of Holguín islets and as Cayo bogeyman, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curious that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by lovers of railways.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations until sugar factories by vias close in steam engines power or.
Their garages tens of years now discovered and are there, machines operating and whose models brothers in other parts of the world are only in museums.
Where go?
The best-known place for most of the vistantes will not change.
So there is no need to talk about Havana or Varadero .
Perhaps, just remember that already mentioned in the Hemingway finances is a museum for those who are admirers of writer, must not fail to see him.
The Viñales valley is the best corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberante vegetation bred in land chalk rock.
Mogotes , pilones chalk rock and rocks of high escarpados in the caidas valley, and its grutas fertile land is aclimatan result from that are roquedales hiding dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where grown probably tobacco higher-quality in Cuba.
On visiting some of the factories habaneras purely could meet their end product.
Perhaps someone suits interesting that there are rodó Chilean part of the number, the Mayor Zeman.
Trinidad
City pedigree old that was founded not long after the Spanish colonizaran the island.
The slavery and sugar brought the fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers arrivals later, in four centuries barely has changed.
Trinidad, between sea and the mountains of Escambray (that is, a place as yet in the 1950s last century was not the road to join with the rest of the country which.
As the isolation helped remain outside the rest.
Nothing new was constructed and so, too, nothing is destroyed, because each person was happy to take place to live.
If you get more time in Trinidad that one late worthwhile places in the immediate vicinity interesting known as Kuta Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with their music silence of the day.
Baracoa
Small city in the extreme west of Cuba, some regarded as the finest of the island.
To be sure that view is already confirmed by the own way.
The two roads arriving apart from Guantánamo must go through high and quebradas mountains, how by nature which barely known man-made.
This place eastern Cuba has been included as a UNESCO World Heritage thanks to its unbroken nature.
Back make better, in his church have the cross Columbus (which is in fact a cross that came 100 years later than landing) and from the hill, where was the house and that there is now a hotel with his name, you can see mountains, including the best-known, the Yunque .
Café, rum, pure, the Sierra Grand, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos , the Cabaret Tropicana patrona , Cuba, Madonna of Cobre Charity, Santería , African religion that provide the descendants of those slaves, this is could fill many pages.
Nevertheless, better, ever seen.

Comparaba today before a court to Khartoum for having given a name to a bear of peluche
The British teacher judged in Sudan to insult Islam has been condemned tomorrow afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The Britannica was accused of failing to pupils of 6 to 7 years the names of Mahomet to a bear of peluche when representation of the Prophet of Islam is inadmissible.
It was pasible a penalty of whipped.
This masterpiece British school age 54 years according to the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested Sunday at home and charged attack Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, thus several complaints from parents of pupils before the Sudanese Ministry of education.
The story goes back to the September, when this professor calls on their pupils, 6 / 7 years old, choosing a name for the bear peluche of class.
Eight names "out of the mouths of children, as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", the director of school Robert Boulos .
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of each 23 have elegigo Mohamed as preferred to name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Prophet Muslim, but above all a name very common in Sudan.
Then children have made a book for class under the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed."
The bear him - it had no label with this name, but the problem is simply representation of the Prophet regarded as an insult Islam.
One of my fellow Muslims Gillian Gibbons , a professor at the same school in Sudan, stated that the knew well and who would never have done something that can be insulting towards a religious faith, "I am only asked children vote for a name," he is only a "honest mistake."
Opinion divided by many masterpiece school pupils that described as "very attentive towards their pupils" and "ever speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name more given in Britain, it writes English with 14 different ways.
This name by families often elegigo Muslim is a way of honouring the prophet (often given the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that concern the use of the name?
Can such due to a toy?
That, of course, is a matter of interpretation.

Reparations spectacular on the space station
We will need more than seven working hours in space to Parazynski Scott astronaut and their fellow crew of the international space Station (ISS ) to make the spectacular repair a solar panel torn and essential for scientific activities of the station.
A departure risky that accumulated records because of its duration, his departure from the livable models, the speed with which was thought up, "chapuceados " by the astronaut instruments for making repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday then that the astronaut had released from the springboard Discovery the drawer Harmony , a heavy piece cilíndrica responsible for early admission laboratories European scientists and Japanese (see framed).
This is a type of drawer landing platform for the módulos-laboratorios .
But we must provide high-grade entertainment power in electricity.
The second task of the crew was because displace a drawer electricity production with solar panels that pesaban 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS , to put it in its final position.
Having shifted, crews began reorganization of solar panels of drawer they have a scale of 76 metres.
This is where one of the panels, they deploy as acordeones , has been damaged in little more or less a metro by a cable that atrancó .
The deployment has not been stopped for more damage the panel.
The astronaut, who had initially make a way out of control of Discovery springboard, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was flawed, were forced to engage the panel damaged.
It is Scott Parazynski who has been elected to go to caracolear at the end of the 30 metres of be remote-controlled arm of the springboard added to the station for making repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker " (andador of space) of the Nasa.

Having scoured precisely the damage, cut cable falible met types of tablets "and" in the area damaged.
I had helped the second "spacewalker " which was near the platform of air and, at home by other astronaut Peggy commander, as Whitson crew.

The choice of the status quo
No surprise Sunday, out of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of Poutine president, Russia united.
Confirmando their quest for stability, even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very limited.
In three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin today leads them to voters televised a message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
What makes as leader of the list for Russia united, the party pro-Kremlin whose victory is overwhelming.
Only the president not left transparentarse receiving the ambassadors foreigners, by simply deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference - its theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and want honest elections, more transparent and more open, elections without incident" added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He tainted by a campaign pressures.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that no "never had elections as dirty, even in the era of Eltsin ."
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the former world champion of check Garry Kasparov sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are banned visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus "
Behind these legislative elections without surprise emerge much more open two questions:
Who will happen to Poutine president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December known to be done.
Elected in 2000 and newly elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek the third consecutive mandate.
Then any successor arises.
What role will play Poutine after March?
Will Prime Minister?
Will head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful party Russia united elegería that the government and the president?
Whatever, legislative elections as to presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus , do not feel masters of their destiny," considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov , head of independent central Levada .
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov university, state of St. Petersburg, goes far: civil society is held back in this country cristianizado five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After liberal reforms in the 1990s, "Poutine restored model of a state paternalistic fully accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a true economic confession", estimated María Lipman , Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians' desire to resign for own personal responsibility "briefly who had shown after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon is all classes, including the world affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (each 85 heads of Russian regions) run local lists of Russia united.
New freedoms imported from the West are often sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of that Russians do not vote for the extremists.
The lesson of Tamara Tcherednitchenko , a professor of age of 54 years: "Why reflect?
Those who are too poor to power are not, why changed? "

Even today in Bad Arolsen , more than 300 employees are permanent tens of thousands of individual demands.

The Balkan fiscal
Carla del Ponte leads eight years relentlessly pursuing war criminals of the Balkans since the office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will with a taste bittersweet, because the main responsible for the Srebrenica massacre - killed 8,000 musulmanes- Bosnians, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain in freedom.
Their names are in this list that takes its title's documentary Swiss realizador Marcel Schüpbach , "The list of Carla '(2006, wings in Spain) that, with the pace of a police thriller , remains the work of the Swiss fiscal from Belgrade to New York to prosecute criminals guests and push governments involved to strengthen the siege.
What assured me?
The sure car, covering the driver of the potential disasters, represents a major expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, age of the cards, marital, type of vehicle to ensure or the use of force, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And, choose appropriate car insurance is even more difficult to choose the model of vehicle.
We must first be clear what we are talking about.
The sure car is an agreement between an insurance company and insured.
This compromise entails a contract insurance, which states that the company receives the value of the premium agreed to change that will be responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, stating given various factors such as age, sex, age of the cards, marital, type of vehicle to ensure or the use of him, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices in terms of statistics, so that more likely to have an accident, larger share to pay.
For this reason that both the elderly of 25 as women have to pay premiums lower, because statistics show that have a lower rate of accidents due to their wisdom.
Similarly, throwing the memoirs, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents that unmarried drivers.
The use of vehicle him to influence the frequency and the likelihood of having any hitch.
By increasing frequency increase the chances.
Many the variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why, that the driver must consider the position to choose the sure car best suited to their profile.
We will make the most significant variables to choose one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years are with various disadvantages to hire insurance at affordable prices, such as the driving and reduced experience in the age of the cards.
Although the ideal to be well secured is a sure, there are alternatives more economic.
The drivers more cautious may choose a whole risk with franchise, so that gain the insurance coverage of all risk but at a price more workable.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer part of the amount of claim.
"The part of the amount of claim that brings the customer is preestablecerá depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher regard lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain of First Europe, insurance mediator online.
Another option is a safe third expanded, so that customers ensures protection against damage to third, but not before the caused in their own car.
Moreover, would be covered by burglary, fire and the loss of vehicle.
A advice.
If you are under 25 tries to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, as this will bonus and reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
One is a bonus reducing tariff on the basis that possesses the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this charge basis.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and profit.
If the company has had a good year can afford to increase subsidies, "makes Noguera.
Pasada Strip drivers 25 years will be easier to hire insurance, since the rate of accidents reduces thanks to experience.
For this reason, it is more sensible recruit any risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of prior experience gained in use in an accident, and even when driving", assures the director of the European company in Spain, which adds that most accidents occur in the second year since past driving, once the 'fear of novice'.
However, if the customer is married but not yet has children is preferable to negotiate a safe, provided that their economic situation permitting, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are viewed by insurers as the public with lower rate of accidents, so that deposits will be less.
In this case the best insurance would join any risk with franchise (could be 300 million), or, when a high level of bonus, one third extended from the third year of life of vehicle.
"They conduct a more relaxed and driving have improved purchasing power to afford to assume a franchise much greater," ruling Luis Noguera.
To pensioners insurance is advisable to any risk with franchise (still this 150 million), or one third expanded when there is a high level.
This sure car is something important, not only because covers the driver before possible disasters, but also because it is a major spending, why is essential to consider properly insurance that suits us more in our personal situation.

New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute gas price between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk of the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each stood between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow gas price increases, Russia will have to pay fees transit higher.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, owner gas monopoly Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money to pay Ukraine by Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that will become more to Ukraine, because it is committed to pay extra 50% in 2008 over gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
The analysts say that could be that Ukraine pay 40% more for imports from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important journeys for gas during talks" said the Finance Minister Anatoly Kinakh to Ukrainian Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not be attributed to our arguments about levels in transit charges
The last major dispute over gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom severed the supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of supply of the EU.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply gas Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "must prove to foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs control criminal records of employees outside Europe, said a vigilant.
The recommendation of general Hearing Robert Black came after found that a doctor abroad related to the attack on the Glasgow airport, in June.
Black also showed their concerns that the Scottish NHS has no idea of the exact amount of expatriate staff with that counts.
However, its report noted other controls in place correctly through a sign of five health authorities.
The general audit chequeó the amount of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area, following the attacks on the Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a doctor's Iraqi Hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested in the airport after a head-on jeep in outside the courtroom airport terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who did in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged with regard to the alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expected to carry out the checkups pre- employment of candidates, to ensure that meet qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the junta of health of Scotland uses "Disclosure Scotland" to enforce controls records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report recommends general improved, among other measures, the dodgy should have the leadership of Records Criminal Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although are some of personal files with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black declares that Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with their own employment policies, but reads: "our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information in the number of staff overseas NHS ."
The chairman of the BMA Scotland, Dr Peter Terry said that it was "very unlikely that the pre-empleo of" checkups can identify potential NHS employees that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
The report suggests that the "of pre-empleo checkups NHS operate in Scotland but it is not clear what is the value of the recommendations," explained.
The Scottish health authorities declare that currently have 1.161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses
But the Judge general warned that the number may be higher, partly because the together have problems in identifying what employees with residency permits indefinite.
The research also found that inspection procedures established by the authorities of NHS in Ayrshire and Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian widely were being met.
This includes passport controls, work permits check-up and skills.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing politics and pre-empleo guide foreign nationals in the NHS .
The Secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon , states: "I had a great interest to pursue this work following the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the board of health, might consider the recommendations of reports and that this will be reflected in updating guides control of pre-empleo for all working groups - including foreign what had planned next month.

Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that arrested 208 militant terrorist cells that planeaban an imminent attack oil installations and attacks against religious and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest supplier of oil said that a was planning cells smuggling of missiles.
Simpatizantes of al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell eight militants consisting of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil installation in eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000 effective force to protect Abqaiq facilities, the world's largest oil plant, after an attack failed of al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a declaration of Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 those arrested belong to a cell led by a "expert on missile," which has entered the country.

Climate Venus gives an idea of the future of the earth
Venus could have been once an appropriate place for life, scientific declared yesterday.
The data of a European space jump into orbit showed the planet more like a twin Earth what had been previously.
Venus is closer to the planet Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy orbits similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years Venus, may have been conditions similar to those who made a planet Earth hospitable, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and solar rotation slower Venus sent a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature of is sufficient to derretir lead and is undermined by the hurricane winds and high storms of lightning.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet by a year, provides a picture of how the earth could develop catastrophic changes to cause climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, states: "It is also why the climate is so different from Venus Earth, two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which began as Venus Earth, possibly with a environment hospitable million years ago."

There remains open
Mitt Romney says that cannot be presidential candidates to answer questions from one monkey snow.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidency possibly entrants to maintain a debate in YouTube , where ordinary voters taped questions in video and sent to its dissemination between candidates.
None of the questions tabled on Wednesday evening 28 November ridiculous were more than the snow monkey that asked democrats global warming in the debate about the Republican Party's of YouTube .
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the Republican Party's state for the elections next year.
No one knows exactly how CNN producers, which co-patrocinan the debate, chose the videos of YouTube to show the candidate aspirants.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focussed on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful clichés for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters that the ideas subieran dial listen when they agradaran : the emitters took note peaks of approval when candidates spoke with arguments extremists.
Exchanges of words harsher night occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the pioneer national, and Mr Romney , which has been juggernaut in the crucial Iowa polls and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney soft because it was with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
It attacked - to Romney , accusing the former governor of Massachusetts recruiting illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded aggressively when I asked whether some candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing illegal immigrants regularize their situation and dandoles the possibility of obtain citizenship).
The minor candidates as Duncan Hunter , a Californian congressman and Tom Tancredo , a congressman of Colorado, succeeded in accordance with the issue.
None of the word be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alert on the immigration issue before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This cliché, alongside fear toys toxic of China and other concerns about the Republicans, foreign aid to forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and conservative Christians.
But the debate was transformed into appeared embarrassed when other issues.
In Guiliani - asked why had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney debate about whether plunging should be viewed in water torture.
A person asked whether candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr Giuliani to cause towards the position that while the Bible was his book front-runner, not literally believed in the history of Jonás and shale.
Another person asked whether Jesus support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -, against all expectations, first in the most recent survey of Iowa , thanks to their Christian conservatism long data- said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When was pushed respond if Jesus would be for the rió Jesus, saying that was too intelligent as to be eligible in elections.
The race unusually remains open.
The too when. Huckabee increases in Iowa , coincidentemente with fundraising campaigns liberal Ron Paul, and their statements heated debate on Wednesday.
They two have come from the bottom, because both sides of party not reached agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate matched the early party and forcefully with a message winner on the greatness of America, satisfying on both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Dolores
Gordon Brown has discovered hole that sink; but equally emerges
As the political scandals remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
We seem to have sold influences, nor is exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, or chupadas fingers extramaritales .
But it has revealed that a rich man of business has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party, more than 650 000 pounds (1.3 billion dollars), for almost four years using names false, and that the party will not denounced.
Two months ago, when the prime minister dodged call a choice, stupidity abused British intelligence declaring that opinion polls influenced not its decision, the hope was that provide a strong government and efficient.
But instead, as Vince Calbe , the liberal democrat leads with ingenuity growing, because the dreaded Mr Brown has gone from Stalin to be - Bean .
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, showed weakness regulatory and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Out proposals to change the tax code business groups, has put together against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed a administrative pastiche inconceivable.
A trio of retired generals began a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against the military spending cuts: be ministers of the armed forces is demanded, a part-time employment.
Now they are multiple donated David Abrahams; Peter Watts, the Secretary General (and previous Labour complicit) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown irrevocably to walk out.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People do not believe as politicians, but usually suspend its incredulity when a new batch take control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve matters, not long understates that suspension is more: public officials are beginning to fail; cabinet ministers are; the press search bad news; and the government is defensive and not focuses.
In part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders cannot be defended by arguing that is new.
Although I disowning Tony Blair, was its lieutenant higher.
The problems of the Northern Rock and registration of authority, are linked to decisions made as Chancellor Brown sector.
Even when is not directly wrapped in setbacks of Blairish partners, "or" effective for research funding of political parties - voters may assume that if it has.
However, the situation of Mr Brown is not as bad as it sounds.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr Bean , nobody is dead, nor has been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is giving what trends. Stalinistas naturally too when Brown have promised: a government always reliable and brutal.
The new political scandal donations is a good example.
The. Abrahams too when, comparing the donations with gifts of charity, says that it wants to public recognition by its benevolence.
This may be true, but the decision not taking him.
Laws against the anonymity for the large contributors politicians is clear and is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
The. Watts too when he said, namely the agreement too when. Abraham, and this was not illegal, obviously face Mendlesohn Based, head of the fundraising who were asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown until now is not involved: no suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has half of work.
It was quick to condemn his party to break the law, but it loses in decision-making by a family affair, a committee of investigation into the matter -conducida largely a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law was raped, is a matter of the police.
Moreover, there are other things that must be done, as too when. Brown find a permanent and independent head for Standards Committee in public administration, it has had one in six months ago, and it must also pressing for a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a hard work Labour's cooperative with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation has with unions -amargas measures to a partisan as too when the. Brown.
But he must confront some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to earn voters; and the only way they can persuade victory is to act with a neat probity and a strong competition.
Sharks cards
The mortgages subprime crisis is infecting the American market of credit cards?
When blood on water, it is only natural that a dorsales ratio naden emocionadas around.
Now that the American market housing is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's market of credit cards.
The analysts estimate that in Goldman Sachs losses in credit cards can reach the 99 billion dollars if mortgages subprime crisis or other forms of credits consumption.
Signos of infection already are.
There is an increase in charges of cards and crime rates, measuring the proportion of the balances that have not been covered or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that has taken 1.4 million office in their business of finance the American consumer, partly because the weakness of borrowers of credit cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
The defaults and crime are low.
According to privatization (, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89 % was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in US law of bankruptcy people (2005) gave rise to a sharp decline in applications of bankruptcy, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and hence defaults) would grow again, or can happen that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also delivers solid payment rates, which shows how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and values backed by assets is quite firm, despite the financial paralysis in other areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup , a signature researcher, predicts that volumes of emissions by the year 2007 will be nearly 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection subprime crisis between mortgages and market credit cards certainly exist: consumers like load debts to credit cards now that lenders are ending.
But the issuer of the credit card looking the flow of liquidity asset values, so that prices fall in accionan not necessarily a change in the creditor capacity of borrowers.
They may even work to aventajar the emitters.
Incentives to consumers continue to have the mortgage declines if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, debt repayment of the card rises in the list of priorities.
The emitters of cards can also respond rapidly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering balances creditors.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid retasación assets.
"We will not generate a day and further assess all loans," says Gary Perlin , chief Capital finances soon.
If a sudden infection of subprime in the market of credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a steady decline are far more realistic.
If prices are lower houses and a credit crunch drive America into recession, industry undoubtedly faces a future more severe.
We must continue to monitor these dorsales ratio.
British Banqueros convicted within Enron case
Three British bankers who were to trial for his responsibility in fraud with the former head of the financial office Enron Andrew Fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally innocent mixed seven charges fraud coludirse with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 for profit at the expense of employees.

The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, as sales of houses reached record the lowest in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence was marked by a warning Bear Stearns , investment bank that cut off 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its workforce, an overall reduction in total cost to offset the loss of their investments in US sub-prime mortgages

England takes with the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who must hit No 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, is Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And, none is less important vis-à-vis the first evidence against Sri Lanka, who should decide?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney , the chairman of the selection is préstamo- with this title particular at least, is here to help Peter Moores the coach, and Michael Vaughan the captain, to decide; and also because the manifestos of Mr Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill overtures to become national dial, and if not, in one part time.
The sixth that fails to beats will be unfortunate, but often life is unjust and sport.
It is not easy to throw what makes a man at the top of their profession, while another never goes further by lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, because they require trials that always remain subjective.
Is the right time to lift Bopara ?
Is it fair to Shah if him?
The same question could be done in other aspect if, says John Edwards "or" Tubby Banerjee , two bright young executives with good degrees and are familiar with the business, had to be promoted chessboard: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a player cricket, unless they give the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance ?
The figures are naturally a great influence on decisions, but it also have opportunities.
Within a team, a player cricket must catch the eye of the captain at the same time to take a wicket and a bateador to opportunities to change the order if wants impact as a player one day.
But catch the eye of the seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many which improved last season, for example, James Anderson, which plays probably in the first test even if Stephen Harmison pleads for fit and bowls like wind networks.
Anderson took 32 wickets first-rate in 33 careers by each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more.
The games of Shah or Bopara get Asgiriya cannot merely be a point of view.
The choice may break or make a man or race, can make a difference.
Four years in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did so well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but was Paul Collingwood struggling to settle at the same time, who went to become a major player, and despite observe cent double against Australia in Australia, may yet be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney Vaughan, and Moores , following a discussion more in today's sitting in the Asgiriya stadium, his instincts will encourage conservation and experience of Shah over the young Bopara exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In support of Shah is your brilliant and valuable proof debut of principles of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds first-rate vis-à-vis only 6 Bopara , who on 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes spin off against the bowling .
But Shah was only ten careers in its two shifts in May in the West against pig proof in Lords, home as Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectores when Vaughan recover its place for the next meeting, seemed to be taken its batting something of élan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team Essex has joie of vivre on swords.
He prende for nothing in the field of cricket and its attitude was summed up as when his vehicle turned into a exposure for the car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
Sufrió minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing you did take their Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, your fellow team that looked at a distance, to say: "Do Viste with excitement that?".
Bopara is the best player, including its slippery for may have effects on their jugadas that seem satisfacerlo , because batea with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choose the best time, another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
My inclination would give Bopara its opportunity, what does not mean that Shah not as suggested sobresalga sheets of tea, he is at stake here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work, and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who stayed without effective, without tracts of visa and hoped that the city back on its feet.
Some even had returned to combat the militants who led the outside their homes.
In the station of Mansour buses, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus train in official government composed of a dozen buses, terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan had turned into private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after to kill many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi , Sunni doctor.
"I today by what I saw in TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what happened in Baghdad and that is now sure."
"The Mahdi army ceased to kill people," states, citing the Shiite militia of the militant religious Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered their troops a cessation momentáneo .
Qassim Shiite, the Atwani 38 years and professor in the area of Amariyah Sunni, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime does not want to Iraqis working in their country.
Its neighbours Shiites in Amariyah they called by phone to say that a force ally of US helped bring Al-Qaeda outside their bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been led from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by an attack of grenades, after which urged citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days, some of my friends and told me that I called had begun such a militia in Sleikh Al-Qaeda and needing my support and my colleagues."
"So I returned today," declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi , 62.
Many people said be swayed by calm growing in the capital since US troops afianzaran groups of "public concerned", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their nearby.
But many declared have returned from denied visas and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
al-Samarrai Salaam, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to common suspicion among exiles, that the Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki Shiite, asked the Syrian government restrictions visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country because of the cuadrillas sectarian of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas from Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"I believe in a government that supports criminals who fire, my home after that made."
Part of the reason for cessation of violence is that Sunnis were expelled from the Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxed tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will emerge again sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smaller federal state is the first in vocational training and even the international orientation conspicuous by their colleges.
As throughout the country, the sarlandeses only a lack of education.
"We explained by 50th time to a sarlandés that are not franseses " - that was the motorbike ironic on themselves the tiniest federal state for their cencuentenario .
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a major role in the education system of Saarland that in a study of the Institute of the German economy (IW ) called "Bildungsmonitor " occupied the fifth place.
Thus, the colleges by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The university of Saarbrücken burned-out was in 1948 by the franseses .
Until now students may end his university career with two or three dipolmas .
As a result, the percentage of nickel foreign students is high, 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students from Sarre exceeds average in schools superior. Many of them are not a bacillerato .
"In the Saar exploits the system of vocational education," says Axel Plünnecke , the experte of education sector in the German Economics Institute (IW ).
More than five young makes their baccalaureate Vocational at the School, so that the Saar points is 7% above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the possibilities for education profesional-académica is extensive.
The offer racing double, relative to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite vocational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Ingeniería Sciences fell one-third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Saarland forced schools superior to do more to advertise specializations in Ingeniería Sciences.
After the first study of PISA made some reforms in schools education general, "says a Education Ministry spokesman.
So the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children soon start to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr ", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model imitate other federal estades .
The comparison with the next studies show if has increased students' performance.
According to the report PISA of 2003, the number of school pupils behind in development desminuyó 29% to 20%.
But, in general, the Saar not improved much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, pupils calculate know better.
To displeasure of the sarlandeses , the report PISA does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field could achieve good results.
Although the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbours is a problem in the mandatory Institutes Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela will be another huso timetable different from the rest of the world.
The 9 December President Hugo Chávez leaves modify the timetable in Colombia farther behind the clock half an hour.
Currently Chávez lagging as a comical in Spain.
As reported the Venezuelan Government, according to the new law, will happen unless four hours GMT.
Thus the Colombia will take a huso timetable does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies their desición by saying that the United States would impose in its day the obligation to the world to change a full time.
Moreover, the Wednesday (hour local) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with its neighbour Colombia because of action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said that there would be no connection with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not do so," says Chávez, who is propulsando constitutional reform where citizens of oil country must decide Sunday into a referendúm .
With this reform could be increased fairly their power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chávez in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in that it was the release of the hostages.
The Sunday Chávez criticizing said that the decision taken by Uribe offended Venezuela.
In Spain is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called cause feeling in the country: "Why are not callas ?" is the phrase that have already unloaded half a million people.
This gave the King of Spain that was disturbed by the continuing interrupcciones by left-wing populists in the last Latin American summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threat to the Germans.

Venus: twin brother Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is unsuitable for life, Venus is more akin to the planet Earth, something that has not yet been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" lightning discovered in the atmosphere and remolinos in the poles, those who are also during winter on Earth.
Since three decades ago researchers had suspect that may be in Venus lightning.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: discovered electromagnetic waves on the verge of the atmosphere. In Venus the sun cayen of heights of 54 kilometres a cloud behind another, and Cris Russell account of the University of California in Los Angeles to scientific journal Nature. "
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller source of life, the sun caused life on Earth storms: could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for its part, had given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus is not the case: if one day had living there, it should be in one of the first states of evolution, "explains Sean Solomon the institution Carnegie Washington.
Today, the surface from Venus cannot be life: the air pressure is almost 100 times higher than in the Earth and the surface temperatures reign 500 ° C oscillating so attainable freezing temperatures.
Possibly, "is a" Venus twin diabolical "on earth, but remains a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to respond to the question why Venus, so close to earth for its mass and size, has had a development so different.
Since the 1990s was no specific missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express " in November 2005 was an important step for research from Venus.
Recent research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature," according to underscore researchers, not just the unity from Venus Solar in the system.
This desmuestra "also planets neighbours are more common characteristics with the Earth we assumed," informs the ESA.
Despite the well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered polar region in the south also a vórtice formed by the clouds that tour faster.
This phenomenon reminds flows of wind in the high land atmospheric strata of poles, according to describes a team of researchers Giuseppe Piccioni Italian Institute of Special Astrofísica and Space Physics.
The second planet Solar System has mass almost equal to the Earth and with their diameter Equatorial 12 kilometres is almost as great.
This world also so-called star of dawn or evening star orbita around the Sun almost 50 days.
But his period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus amounts to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with their surface temperatures 460 degrees and with its air pressure of 92 bars is not to earth, scientists assume that both planets had been created in the same conditions.
In both planets was patchwork water on Earth remained oceans, but in Venus has cut itself off in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones Venus, form the bulk of the atmosphere.

According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young was not because of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke .
The actions far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its final point and that we should not expect nothing more than it.
But in what really country live Chancellor?
After his heartbreaking action, indifferent and without much content in the overall discussion of the Lower House must say: it did not live in the country that ought to be governed by it.
On the reproach him for having repeatedly devoted in foreign policy, Chancellor rejected it with a unpretentious Council sentence.
He said that this would be a truly provincial and showed that did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House was very clearly expresses all that this accusation was right.
They could not feel the slightest interest, or any feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke was this: a policy very high fleeing in foreign policy and falls there without achieve anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: much praised itself by the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these goals in matters of climate.
Overall, this way of alabarse herself to two years ago the leader of the Union Demócratocristiana has not been allowed such modesty.
Because persists in expressions to bring a boost to the people.
And in this way damages their public image by the pragmatic approach to solve the problems without go from the subject.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke aparencias internal problems are of little value.
The poverty of children and concerns about low-wage workers?
The only thing that is being devoted to talk about this issue using prayers subordinated.
It is amazing how many times is wrong to speak when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a phrase more or less good.
It is beginning to cause "as if he had been into uncharted territory" when it was more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two front-runners Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney , did a confrontation in a heated debate precandidatos Republican presidential and now need fear of YouTube only one candidate the outside.
Since there are signs tensions between candidates.
Mitt Romney blamed for his adversary Rudy Giuliani that it had turned to New York "in a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with serious accusations: "I say that its own house was a" port "for illegal immigrants." Giuliani explained to ex-governador of Massachustes saying that he was who used to illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attacks: as before the group of Republicans has no clear front-runner, the eight presidential precandidatos exploit the debate on CNN, especially to discredit his adversaries.
Small videos 30 seconds, rodados by internet usarios who were sent to Youtube , nor have much content.
"In this way of isolation left Hitler coming to power," that was the accusation of John McCain his adversary Ron Paul, the only meeting insisted that immediately withdraw troops from Iraq.
Romney receives too much criticism by the war veterans in Vietnam, when refuses to acknowledge as torture Waterboarding "," a method of interrogation by drowning a person simulate his death.
The reactions to the public in the Chamber in St. Petersberg missions in Florida show that the most important issues of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or debates on torture.
The public applauded always very strong when who praised conservativos values and refused tax increases.
We can do better where are the weaknesses of both front-runners.
At that time I mistakenly "and", explains Romney compungido is sorry people and the public television for having been defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what say when asked what he thought about literal interpretation of bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn as president.
We have the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Friday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took juramiento for a second term of 5 years.
The Pakistani television direct delivered on the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf was sworn respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday transferred army chief its mandate to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani and thereby accepted international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after he seized power with a bloodless coup, ex-general governs for the first time the state as civilian leader.
With his position as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf was the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The second requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum , Attorney General of the state, after the juramiento Musharraf will soon overrule the state of emergency and reach the second condition in the west.
Since was proclaimed emergency rule in the Supreme Court many lawyers were supporters of Musharraf. Last week, the country's Supreme Court rejected all resources before the controversial new elections the head of government 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack to train of the military in Northern Watiristán region, five soldiers died and other four wounded.
According to information from the army spokesman a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
They return the founders of Krautrock .
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia " participated in a concert in Berlin.
As reestreno became a copy of "Live 1974" which was written in the heyday of gang.
Back in those days were very famous in foreign countries.
The presence of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the feeling.
Each before it cajita , their cable and especially its buttons.
In the natural sits Dieter Moebius of 63 and is dressed in a white straitjacket.
In his left is Michael Rother 57 years, which has its portable computer and guitarra .
On the right, looking the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius , 73 years of age, which is busy with the panel of controls.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them are even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This does not upsets Lords.
Something very exciting to enthusiasts of Krautrock was the fact that the Harmonia band reverted to music.
What we must disclose here: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the gang retumbaba in the minds of people, but it was not such a special to 32 years after the public extrañase both.
But why Germans cannot also applaud his legend lives of the 1970s?
Especially since the error Kautrock was always more useful in England and the US than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a prize music "I searched" members of the gang That Cologne 2003 for his work in the Chamber of life, we could see the faces shocked artists pop of Germans.
And when Hot Network Chili Peppers agradecía to gang The Düsseldorf and Neu !, all opened up with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother time spent on the scene for concerts Network Hot Chili Peppers as it was an old friend (gang).
Ignorance at home and abroad, recognition is one thing.
It is a problem remind this band, because only existed trio two years and in those days not achievement a great effect on the public, however, was subsequently thanks to others.
It is a time Moebius and Roedelius had done music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster , which promised much reputation.
Initially tocaban in the cellar Berliner Schaubuehne .
Then, for economic reasons, worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronizada by a church.
For a while, Rother had a trabajillo in Kraftwerk and then worked guitarrista band Neu ! He improve the reputation for German this band in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed musicians of Cluster in exile to Forst in Weserbergland .
In Alten Weserdorf , which is in ruins the 16th century lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological that in the Comune R, where Roedelius could take his position.
That was more a life of artist full of surprises.
According to say, one day appeared a cosy compact song Harmonia association of Ottenstein in the garbage, proved to be a good name for art.
There was also disadvantages in the use of Harmonia name.
The first albúm called "Musik von Harmonia " and the second "The Lux."
Despite the music was calm and simple, the gang took financial problems.
Life as artist was not only for known itself.
The CD "Live 1974" was engraved during a concert in Griessem . Someone recalls that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed its desire to push through Harmonia and do occasionally trials.
To Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the habits.
In 1975 band announced its separation.
Rother ended in matters of esoterismo and secured its existence with álbumes as "Flammende Herzen ."
Cluster revived the 1980s and from this time has been more successful than had Harmonia .
The direct recording of albúm in Griessmer , must therefore thank Groenemeyer .
Its music company Grienland cultivate this goal was as German own contribution to preserve it as music alive.
As the work of Roedelius , also gang Neu ! was again exposed.
The presentation of Harmonia as gang takes place in the House of the World Cultures in Berlin.
The gang was subsidized with public measures of Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of manual "Krautrock Sampler ."
There is also present Dr. Motte , the inventor of Loveparade .
Thus, all of Krautrock influences the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a súper-banda , since he was a vacuum.
The sentence of Mr Eno hand-in-hand with special music full Room: "This music is the only some music, she would partenece the fúturo ."
There are photos where appears Harmonia with producers in a holding.
The history of the development of the legend shown in projections of photos black-and-white where are instruments with wires.
Basically there are three veterans that began improvised again.
We do nothing more than bugs fix the body and set to produce special tones with the help of equipment effects that had built with their own hands.
Currently music is electronics and had to be.
Three people more technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the leadership of Bárbara Morgenstern music, in an environment is susurra coughs, and in a timely manner of emphasis is hymn "Aaaaaaaah !"
Krautrock because it was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
It is sought gender in origin, but in schools blues music (That), in technologies (Kraftwerk ) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster ).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains calm.
In the scene well think about what is already clear.
Where begins and where it ends music?
That may break one imminent or rapid spare moments of luck.
In Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" engaged again in the war in the Balkans.
But both were not so much conviction.
Or the concepts are set much in actions and tirotes or the two films are demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with their "The Hunting Party" cannot help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there in the dark inside the country during the Bosnian war was discovered again Richard Gere actor.
Finally had lost view man more guapo 1980s, because nobody wanted to look after their roles and pleasant unimportant in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what pursues" (Why nowadays films diplomas have to be so long and egregious?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to view: basically reporter its role in the war is presenting what could make Richard Gere , if the destination and the film industry had not been so misericordiosos with him. He were a man whose better times of life, which already became a monument ruin of its decline maintained hitherto most of their charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" production is German and will also be presented this week, are only a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
You can narrar the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in short: there are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol Max Riemelt ) who want to save a Serb the francotiradores of Kosovo, one of them act very quickly and it leads to enamore it.
The sense of the film is lost through actions and fire, while we welcome the Serbs are not presented once again as the Hobson.
The film is like the German number "So Alarm all 11" without highway, but in a state of war.
In the case of "The Hunting Party" can be investigate, because never really was a good film on the war in the Balkans.
In another moment, with another director and with another author of script (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about reporters Americans in the war that is going to detect a Serb war criminal so-called "fox", probably could be a new "Now" blowing.
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: the small teams are twice to mountains to accomplish something that cannot do the army and it is becoming a trip on folly.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when the start before us Simon Hunt, he cannot be simply a cynical with heart.
No, the script also provides an adventure with a loving Bosnian Muslim that will kill course.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from the truth, especially when over the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieve what could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the heads of the world, which was capture war criminal and leave to musulmanos Bosnians to vengaran .
It is so badly, who want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimenes against logica cinematica .
However, the lack of punitive is indeed one profondamente human.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić esten even free, and that the Americans and the French funding is not really worried tracked down because they political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and bad are so similar, so that we have in mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this peoma is a mask a demon Asia: "in the face of their effect gandes see, sharing feelings with him, it is hard to be bad".
In films as "The Hunting Party" is also these demons but they show that is hard to be good.
The problem is not only to gender films war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all films on Iraq are produced in Hollywood fiascos.
It can also add that there has never been a good film on southern Africa.
Almost a rule: when it is always a star goes by a region of crisis or by the landmines, then something like "Rangoon have recently" with Patricia Arguette , "Over all borders with Angelina Jolie" or "Diamantes sangrientes " DiCaprio with them.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred in a short time.
They must move at least decades until ruede Hollywood film about the Holocaust bearing a good example is the film "The list of Schindler ."
Some films already need more time. The as classic works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter blowing," "Now" or "Full Metall Jackett " in his times were not concluded unanimously as masterpieces.
Today it might know too on world conflicts, and so our times each massacre (Massenmord ) has submitted directly in two television at home.
This is because the authors of script they have no qualms (that is necessary in order to) in narrar good stories.
Being "or not to be" or "The great dictator" were ultimately so good, because Lubitsch Chaplin and still not so bad knew that was really the Nazi regime.
Perhaps should not be a good man for a film.
Perhaps we must be as novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its sights sarcastic distant and an artist.
When asked him on his novel historical parallels between "Swedish of Lemprière " and the war in the Balkans, replied "That is due to some things never change their."
Large cities always be in danger, men are always going to be killed cruelly and Yugoslavia always reign war.
von Beust receives as negative answer criticism on the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism of politics and economics by not requesting the Summer Olympic Games of.
Many people want to continue to fight for competitions in section of water sports.
But Beust recalls the need to be realistic considering the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz , director of the chamber of trade in Hamburg, asserted Wednesday this resignation as "no good for economic location."
In the last time any other project in the city motivation pandered such as the idea of the Olympic Games.
Without this objective "could not keep the political momentum sports, at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz Senate had not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "another time."
On Wednesday the mayor Ole von Beust kept his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympic Games of there were no at least until the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but so chooses the Federation of German Olympic sports," says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE .
Remitió the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund ) expected early December, on the application of the Munich Olympics the winter of 2028.
This means that "preference for us in this period, who previously thought have until 2028, from the point of view realistic will not have an opportunity."
Despite all this dream was not forever, said von Beust .
The Federation of sport Hamburg (HSB ) regrets von Beut statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg is not to seek the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to take the opportunity, if at this moment plans are bankrupt," said the Wednesday Günter Ploß , the director of HSB .
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the statement the head of senate that did in a reception during the general meeting of the German public Federation of sport high school (adh ).
There von Beust appointed the request of Hamburg to Universiadas 2015 not as "a replacement" Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport high school Hamburg appointed as a candidate application.
The Fraction German Social Democrat Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion ) blamed in the senate that did not take the time so valuable to build houses in Hamburg.
For many years the Senate was delaying "with the development of small Grasbrook district, because this era in the Olympics or plans to build houses," claimed Carola Veit and Jan Quast , members of the German Social Democrat Party (SDP).
While the SPD always demanded integrated planning Olympia for small Grasbrook and then the use of houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request of Hamburg for the Summer Olympic Games of 2012 caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
There are wooden boxes.
Whoever links the terms Sweden and timber box, believes Ikea, but not think Andy Warhol .
Or yes?
Currently wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow hanging over the list of Warhol works.
Most of the 1990s and four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen called" doubts about the true Brillo-Boxes of 1968 of Andy Warhol , the museum decided Stockholm Museet made internal investigations and reached conclusions disappointing: the six "Brillo-Boxes ", that the ex-director museum of Pontus Hulthén into museum Museet decided, are false and almost a cent of others of "type Stockholm," which are in circulation in the art market are also international.
The times is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic production and patrocionadas .
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes " grim picture was painted wooden boxes blue red and white, with the same shows that had cartons dust soap "Brillo ."
According to Warhol , in the explanatory their works 1968 in the museum decided Museet were exposed hundreds of Brillo-cajas of card. These did not Warhol (due to expenditure), but were brought directly factory card "Brillo ."
It was in art, but of copies (which were just a objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed produce a wooden Brillo-cajas in Sweden, but not were exposed to the museum Modern Museet .
Jehovah's those times now talk about almost fifteen boxes, who at the time came in the history of art and the auction original as "Brillo-Boxes " from "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol .
In auctions some of them were bought by more than 100 billion dollars.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hulthén did false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a cent of boxes wood Warhol are left him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in year in 1990 to Hulthén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
In this time Warhol was dead for three years.
Mr Byström , the head of the conservatives in the museum Museet decided, explored six Brillo-Boxes museum three state-owned and private property Swedish were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First imprimieron and esmerilaron their platas busy and then the painted the oil because it will do them with the pincel .
On the contrary, the structure of copies of 1990 shows that paint was implemented with a 'because without print directly platas busy. It is not paint the oil because it will do them, but paint acrílica .
"These funds have not been approved by the artist and must be removed from the list of official Brillo-Boxes Andy Warhol ," says Mr Nittve , the director of the museum Museet decided, and adds that if The Committee on Autentificación "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the museum Museet decided clasificará these six boxes as copies / objects of exposure. "
Back in Julius The Committee on Autentificación formally announced that accepts these "serious accusations" that is dust boxes bubbles.
But since then there all remained silent all.
