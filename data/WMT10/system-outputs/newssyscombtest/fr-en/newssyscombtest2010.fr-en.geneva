The shortage of snow in mountain worries the hoteliers
The deserted tracks are not putting down problem only at the exploitants of skilift.
The lack of snow deters the people to reserving their stays at the ski in the hotels and pension.
Thereby, is always possible to track free bedrooms for all the dates in winter, including Christmas and Nouvel An.
We have many of visit on our site.
The internet surfers are covering the offers, ask the prices but do not dare to promise to reserve for the moment.
And calling they call us, they ask at once if he will have there the snow otherwise of the mud at Christmas, "has announced Martin Jandura, exploiting of the gate of news Spindl.Info.
If one wants to go by Nouvel An of his dreams at Špindlerův Mlýn, better worth to more too be nervous to reserving.
And which if one prioritizes the economies the quality of the housing is coming only then, then can try to waiting still for some days.
Špindler's hoteliers propose for now only stays of a week for Nouvel An.
I think that they are going to try still a time to place them, but they will give them up as and more short periods.
And then the number of free bedroom is quickly going to diminish, "has estimated Jandura.
The tourist agency Ingtours of the Vrchlabí as still proposes beds of free for all the periods of winter.
The week Christmas interests us the more for the moment, she is not fully sold.
He still remains of free, say, the half of the bedrooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared some stays of Christmas of last times fewer dear, "has indicated the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of the Vrchlabí can equally propose Nouvel An at Krkonoše, fewer of free place but ago.
The fourteen first days of February are just as well leaving, the remaining wintry stays moderately sell.
This year, the interest for the stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that it is always not snow at Krkonoše.
The people wait start to falling.
Nobody wants to pass the winter to the mountain without snow.
If the tracks cover during the week, also Christmas will be complete," thinks Schiefert.
At the opposite, the occupation of the eastern hotel Horizont at Pec pod Sněžkou slightly superior to the last year.
One has an improvement of approximately five percent.
Has left us some last places for the new year like for Christmas he.
A big Polish interest during the holidays of January of the ago February and well sells as, "shapeless Karel Rada, director of the good hotel of Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is equally complete at eighty percent during the period of the Nouvel An.
At the opposite, the half beds stay empty at Christmas in the more recent hotel of Jánské Lázně.
This year, we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation at the moment.
February is one little plus weakling for now but as soon as the snow is going to fall, the interest for the stays into the Krkonoše will grow still certainly has indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hoteliers of the Krkonoše must however not expect more from snow.
Thursday he will become more fresh and if he has there haste, they would have to be snow-covered in mountain.
But afterwards, would have to warm, informs Jiří Jakubský of the station of Hradec of the Czech hydrométéorologique institute.
The United States: Repetition is mother of wisdom
He becomes same comic, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president at the reputation of wise, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, he considered itself as simple good.
When has ended up he to perspiring his so ardently expected doctrine, he has proved that he had rewritten at the carbon-paper ever since Bush's Iraqi scenario of three years ago.
No happy to use in the text even several times the expression" like in Iraq ", has not been nervous, who more, to using the title of the speech of Bush of January 2007 like title of his own speech:" A new road in beforehand"
Simultaneously, he has personally criticized Bush's idea to sending new reinforcements in an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being" irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in his consequences. "
The next months have however shown only the strategy which who of Bush, was emanating from the recommendations of the commanders of country, was the lonely possible and likely of success at such point at the moment the newspapers not at all speak Iraq.
This has not improved Bush, that said, objectively talking, he has left to his successor a final situation well more favourable that one can hope. 's reputation
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle is going to recur
This are again the commanders of country who have asked to him an increase of the contingent military, among others the commander of the Afghan operation, the general Stanley McCristal, who has even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House in spite of the the habit of subordination.
He asked 40000 men in order to cannot to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated during three months but in the absence of a good option, he has at least swindled the general of 10000 soldiers.
Has succeeded to eradicating the promise of 5000 additional on behalf of Europe, even if he counted on 10000 originally.
Appears to be his intention to remove the armies of Afghanistan of here 18 months and to end all this process of here three years. All the doctrine of Obama brings more of question that she providing with answers.
Many doubt of the fact only one increases half will bring the same fruits only the progression in Iraq.
In pique of the fratricidal wars of these last years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and his leader honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation differentiates by the exact opposed is-- one can count on nobody and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan strengths of security, accustomed to changing leader from day to day according to this who arranges them.
The political institutions, good will have left only the powder at the eye behind which are going to proliferate the patriarchal ethnic relation.
Is oddly complex to balance the interests of the several ethnic groups considering the the lack of light as for the the reports, who are still complicated by the and Iranian Pakistani influences.
Even the foundation of a" state swift to act", who the aim of basis is that the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The worldly horizon of the strategy of Obama makes puzzled of by his voluntarism.
In the eight last years, the situation in Afghanistan has made what to deteriorate and she is currently on the verge of the the chaos.
Lonely an heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers messenger in the tumult of the war in the prospect of their quick" return to the house" are going to bring there a real miracle.
A political viewpoints, to define a date in order the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last top of NATO has shown that the will of the Europeans to participate at the military operations in Afghanistan directs the negative.
The European politicians know do not want to explain to their voters the security in Germany or in Italy is connected to a war in the Hindu Kush's mountains.
An other factor capable to distorting radically the situation is the evolution of the events connected to Iran.
If continues to deteriorate and that the reinforced sanctions have step of effect on the Iranian, the American will meet against the very difficult matter of a resolution of the problem by the appeal at the military strength.
Will necessary to reply there for example drove, according to Obama, America will drive at the victorious withdrawal of the troops of Afghanistan.
Each solution to this type will however take a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The lonely rustine in order Obama is the fact that has left three years until the the presidential election and therefore he still enough has left time so that he works on a new strategy he, in case this one himself révèlerait being one total fiascos.

Besides the scientific quatre it was also the German writer of origin Romanian Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider have received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the price Nobel from medicine for their research in the domain of the chromosomes.
The price of chemistry has summer awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to have lightened the structure and the function of the ribosomes
The last prizewinner has received the price Nobel from economy, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of the economical governance.
The lonely technical discipline who has not had of prizewinner this year has been the physics.
This price has been put back today at the scientists Charles Kao for his research in the domain of the optical fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of the fleas CCD, who are currently at the basis of all the devices photo numerical, fax or astronomical telescope.
Each prizewinner has received the diploma, the medal Nobel and the certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
This one reaches ten million of Swedish crown in each category. (about 1.1 million of euro)

At present he have there, according to him, step of solution favourable.
Well would cannot to bring an improvement, if he can lean on a more wide consensus of the political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is alarming and that the government would have to put his subsequent existence back in cause.
The ODS Petr Nečas's vice-president has announced at the ČTK only the idea of a steady administrative office by the ČSSD, the ODS and the greens does obviously no longer function.

Morgan Freeman récompensé American, actor at the Oscars, embodies the picture on the life of Nelson Mandela tireless, combatant against the racist diet of the apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman has announced, that this is a Mandela old of quatre-vingt-onze year who has asked it to embody him in the picture.
Matt Damon plays an other important role.
I have said to him: "If I must embody you, I would have to cannot to see you personally..
The actor old of soixante-douze year who have been rewarded for a price for his role in the situated drama Milion Dollar Baby de Clint Eastwood in the middle of the boxing, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against the slavery grown himself slave, a president of the USA fictitious, indeed same God in the picture Evan Tout-Puissant mais never someone of still living and of as important pro so much of person am Mandela.
The South African man of state has summer imprisoned 27 years for his hard work for the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He has been put back in freedom in 1990 and has became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus are an undefeated Latin word signifier and this is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley publié in 1875.

Freeman has worked some years in order to bring the story of Mandela on big screen.
I did not have of other goal of the reality, otherwise to play this role so that approach he the more has said Freeman.
The plus big challenge for me this was of course that to talk like him
The actor has declared that if him and the international politician were in the same area, would have tried to meeting Mandela, to dine with him, to be in backstage before his speech
The more important for him was that to squeeze him the hand.
I have accounted when I squeeze you the hand, I retrieve from your energy, she transmits and I had the impression that to know which feel how, he has said.
He is importing for me to try to becoming an other person.

The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: The Russians tested a rocket
Has cannot to watch a strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin above of Norway.
Has recognized yesterday to have tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launching has however still been a failure and the missile of type" Bulava" who who had originally to be the pride the Russian army progressively becomes the nightmare of the Russian generals and first minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the time of the the test of the rocket has not had the looked-for effect on the success of the trial flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava has not taken off, or she has damaged in lots of flight.
The Russian newspapers speak" Bulava" like the" missile who is not flying"
A missile but who who is not stealing shines
This 13ème test occurred in the beginning normally.
That is only at the end of the the flights he again there damages on the equipment.
This is obviously the engine of the third storey of the rocket who has exploded.
This time," Bulava" has taken off of the submarine nuclear power Dmitrij Donskij who was sailing under the surface of the sea Blanche.
This type of missile can be rightly put in fire of an and submerged boat in movement
This is the reason for which precisely the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has probably been by a faulty" Bulava".
Besides, the Norwegian have not doubted a moment that he is a matter of a Russian rocket.
The generals claim that this time, one can not speak absolutely failures.
The two first storeys of the rocket have resisted and the damage has touched only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have known blackouts on the first storey.
Even if none of the launchings of test has happened without tear, the direction of the ministry of defence does only only consider six on thirteen have been failures.
This pass rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and he therefore claim that a day" Bulava" will steal trouble-free she will even blow up ten hypersoniques nuclear stones of a total weight of 1.15 tonne.
The legendary Fetissov has signed at 51 years one contracts of an year with the CSKA Moscow
The defender legendary Viatcheslav Fetissov will again introduce in a professional match to 51 years.
Is going to come to assistance at his team of the CSKA Moscow in need and will make his probablementdéjà entry at the time of the the matches Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who has put finely in his career at forty years in 1998, is for the time being the president of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we have of urgency need for an other defender.
Fetissov regularly practises and is in agreement in order to help the team.
We must still settle some details on the form, announces the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, city by the agency AP.
He has been not clarified if the comeback of the legendary player of hockey will concern only a lonely match.
I think that Fetissov is one of this who am capable to reinforcing the mental other players, have appropriate Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the player of old Russian professional hockey the more.
In NHL, the attaquant legendary Gordie Howe has played all a season in order Hartford and has got 15 goals and 26 audiences.
The more old of the quintet famous Fetissov, Kassatonov -- Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the good players of hockey and among this having the more success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he has unhooked two times the gold at the Olympic games, seven titles of champion of the world, he has triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the championship world-wide junior.
In the second part of his career, he harvested the tributes also in NHL where by two times he has held the Stanley Cup.
He is member since 2001 of the Temple of the fame of the hockey.
Hyundai has listened to the trade unions and all cancels the overtime works
The direction of the factory Hyundai of Nošovice has put in agreement with the trade unions in order to cancel all the overtime works.
This is rightly because of the the overtime works frequent that the trade unions have announced a state of strike of urgency Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the factory Hyundai has confirmed him.
The direction however wants to put still in agreement with the trade unions on a finely-worked Saturday this year still.
Which we can not give our plan of production up, he is essential, this is for that what voluntary overtime works have been proposed the Saturday 19 Dec knowing he two equip, has announced Vaněk.
The site Sedmička.cz has indicated that the society has proposed a Czech bonus 400 crowns at the wage-earners who would belong of the team of Saturday.
He will be assigned also have postériori for the day finely-worked the 28 November.
The society, according to Vaněk, has decided to change the way to justify his wage-earners in exchange for overtime work.
Either they receive the supplement in order the hours on top of that, either can to put down an holiday of replacement the 28 December and to extend thus their parties of end of year aindiqué Vaněk.
On top of that of that on Saturdays all the present wage-earners will receive a compensation for the transportation costs and for their lunch.
Considering the the facts that the overtime works support the point the more urgent and the more warm in the comments and the claims of the trade unions like the wage-earners who have stopped spontaneously the production last week, the direction has made the immediate decision to cancel all the overtime works for the month of December, has announced Vaněk.
Until the week last, were forcés to work almost daily two overtime works on top of that of their eight hours.
Intend to cancelling the state of strike after signature of the agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the automotive factory and the trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The syndical ruling Petr Kuchař has declared Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike in the event of agreement about their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the factory has towered last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees have started spontaneously strike because of ceaseless overtime work.
They also protested against the bad conditions of salary and so-called bizutages.
The direction has defended with the fact the wage-earners had to work which in supplement in order to stuff the requirements as regards production of automobile.
At the time of the announcement of the strike Monday, the trade unions have equally asked this that the wage-earners having the production are subjected to no sanction.
The trade unions ask the society to pound the preterite to overtime work at the minimum.
Of more than, they want this year one remuneration of 5000 crowns( 209 €about) for this one.
The factory automotive Hyundai of Nošovice uses currently 2000 persons.
She has kicked off the mass production the last year in November.
She has made about 80000 vehicles until September of this year, while having an ability of production of 200000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: A substance who functions on the viruses VIH" hardy" as
A team of and German Czech scientist tests new combinations who can slow down the proliferation of the virus VIH in the body.
The main advantage of the substance improved is that she equally acts on the viruses who has already developed an immunity at the drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the standard variants of the virus as well as certain already available drug.
Is not possible to cure the SIDA at the moment.
One can prolong radically the life of the sick persons via a mixture of drug who prevent the multiplication of the virus VIH in the body nevertheless.
Their consumption however takes a series of side-effect.
In addition the repression of this multiplication has for effect the development of this call robust viruses on which the drugs have pleased effects.
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the university Heidelberg opens the lane a way to make against the resistance virus.
They have shown substances called metalocarboranes acted on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the virus of the VIH.
The metalocarboranes are an assembling of bore, of hydrogen, of carbon and of cobalt.
This combination jams the development of the virus of a way different from all the employés drugs up to now and therefore would cannot to surmount the problem of the resistance.
The work of the researchers brings them to discover new substances" improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular engineering of their links on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have an unique three-dimensional structure: Two cages at multiple wall are formed by the atoms of bore, of hydrogen and of carbon, the cobalt bound by a metallic atom, in this case.
An and robust treacherous virus.
The protéase of the VIH is a protein of the virus VIH who are essential at the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the virus VIH caused by the protéase of the VIH he not birth of mature infectious particle of the virus.
If one stops the protéase of the VIH, one will also stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the researchers in a Czech press release publié by the Institut de chimie organique et de biochimie of the Academy of Sciences of Republic.
In their works publiés in the scientific revue Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combination two pairs of cage( cf. tableau) are bound by a short organic link, who is then systematically changed.
One little plus but more reliable weakling.
The efficiency of this series of substance on the protéases of the VIH has been tested in test tube as well as on his robust variants, received next to infected patient by the VIH.
On the standard version of the enzyme, the effect of the metalocarboranes is not as well only on the clinical drugs, however he does not weaken on the robust versions against which the standard drugs are often inefficient.
The metalocarboranes, with their mechanism of unique action and their other properties like their and chemical biological stability, their weak toxicity and the possibility others chemical modifications are therefore combinations interesting to examine more in order to head for the clarification of effective drug against the VIH, asserts Řezáčová Pavlína, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and of the institute of the molecular genetics of the Academy of the sciences.
Fights around for budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends
The ODS democratic civic( Party) 's president, Mirek Topolánek has described" alarming" the budget ratified for the year next and according to him, the government first minister Jan Fischer would have to put his existence back in cause.
The first minister has described the remarks of the ODS as drastic verdict.
Says that to consume time in order to analyse.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas has announced only the idea of a steady administrative office by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party did obviously no longer function.
According to Nečas, the leader of the government would have to decide if ilprend at Parliament of the support on the minority who worries delegated to fight at the growing deficit to stay in his functions with the help left-wing parliamentary left.
Nečas warned the ODS only's positions and social democrats with respect to the problem of the public deficits are diametrically opposite.
The House of Representatives has ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with however the proposals of modification to the tune of 12 billion of crown enclosed by the left.
Parliament has increased the money destined the at the salaries of the civil servants, at the working of the social services and at the direct payments at the farmers.
The grievance of the government towards the proposals of the social democrats was the fact that they increased of indirect way the deficit of the budget.
Czech Republic would have to manage a deficit of 163 billion of crown.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, thus obeying at the wish of the government like what an amended budget is a variant less bad than a budget of interim period.
Disappointment and uselessness
The minister of the finances Eduard Janota has spoken disappointment and a feelings of uselessness, the first minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government is going still to think about the current situation.
Nečas are convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his functions in the event of ratification of the proposals of modification, would cannot the situation to be various.
According to the Czech Télévision, Janota has made appointment Monday with the first minister after his passage at the government:
He has indicated simultaneously that he wondered if he was going to stay in his functions.
His disappointment as for the the negotiation around the the budget is the reason he.
If decides to continue to fighting against the budget deficit, Nečas estimates the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the changes of the budget, not their place in the government.
The first minister would equally have to say clearly that he will resign if Parliament ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit like for example this who touch the health insurance, the retirements, or the reform of the law on the services.
Topolánek: The so-called ministers by the ODS are not in cause.
This is the matter of the leader of the government Fischer and all the government.
The so-called ministers by the ODS have nothing made of detrimental, has underlined Topolánek in a literal communiqué from the United States.
He has reminded that the vice-ministres of some ministries ask for TOP 09, have who voted against the budget.
Nečas has stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation against the the facts that to lead one struggles against the amount of the deficit of the public finances," he is quite logical and correct that he bases the majority left-wing who is currently at Parliament. "
This says, he democrats must not expect the at the support and at the tolerance democrats.
I have not reflected and a time that that being at the agenda then I will devote there, has announced ever since Parliament to the journalists, the minister of defence Martin Barták elected, representative at the government precisely by the democrat.
The first minister Fischer has taken off in in the afternoon for a debate of the European council in Brussels.
The ODS has done reverse to the demand for the first minister.
Nečas has stressed simultaneously that the ODS would have probably voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the democratic deputies to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not have the feeling that to be orphans, one is not small children, he has reacted to the matter of learning if the ODS had not undergone criticisms on behalf of the the president of the Party at Parliament or in the country at the time of the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have made flaw.
I knew already at the time where I have given my mandate up only this who would be following in the next months am a bolchévisation of Parliament and one destruction of all this he there of positive, reacted Topolánek in nobody.
According to the ČD's new schedules he will have there fewer of train for the identical rates.
Am going to abolish or to restrict from the the 13 December some less laden or regional express trains and will on the contrary reinforce some others he.
The total blanket of the transports will drop at the day of entry in effect new schedules of two percent with respect to today.
Most of the fixings of the rate will not change, including the standard rates and the limited rate.
This are for example the inhabitants of the area of Ostrava more of link towards the capital, the railways are going to add a Pendolino train.
At the opposite, is going to stop a fast train to serving Bratislava.
He will equally have fewer of fast train on the České line Prague-- Písek-- Budějovice, the line direct Prague-- Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the more big reduction in the transports concerns the area of Hradec Králové of eight percent at the total, in revenge Prague and his surroundings can rejoice at an increase.
Two trains overnight on the České line Prague-- Tábor-- Budějovice equally am and the circulation of some express trains on the line Prague cancelled -- Písek-- České Budějovice will amount to only some days in the week.
Among the more big changes, one can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: For the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
He is a matter of the fifteenth line of the system of suburb Esko, of the possible eastern opening thanks to the completion of the electrification the line is entering Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines towards the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague nádraží( Praha Hlavní).
The ČD will introduce more of line SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains at destination of Šumperk/ Jeseník will leave per interval from two hours.
Will no longer cannot to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from the the 13 December.

Had been in order to have shown itself on the lawn in undershirt, is considered in South Africa as something of sacred, had been for a long time ovationné about fourteen years ago mainly of the public white and Mandela has been recognized by the white populations by the white populations.
Hope that will succeed to uniting the people again in a lonely nation, has indicated the player of rugby Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the single" noir" of the national team.

The vaccination against the pneumocoques will be free and optional
The vaccination against the pneumocoques will overturn the old habits from January.
She will be being the optional première at being free and in same time for the families.
Voices are rising already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations in order the introduction of the free vaccination counters the pneumocoques tower.
The pharmaceutical institute defines already for the vaccines the maximal prices are going to pay for the health insurances.
The specialists show up equally clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, the children be born the last year from the the 2 August can be vaccinated free against the pneumocoques.
The condition is that they have been not yet vaccinated.
If one has started the vaccination the last year or more early, one will have to pay for himself the next vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine must be managed between the 3ème and the 5ème month of the child.
The last year already a quarter of the families has deliberately vaccinated his children against the pneumocoques.
Yet the parents paid for 1600 crowns indeed more for a dose.
The vaccination of the plus young requires four doses.
The specialists estimate that each year the health insurances spend 300 at 450000 crowns in dose of vaccine.
They however economize on the medical cares which the children not vaccinated would require.
Up to now the state about spent 500000 crowns per year for all the vaccination of the children.
The vaccination paid back has been introduced with the" packet Janota".
The pneumocoques are the cause of inflammation of the medium ear but also of serious infection of the inflammation of the méninges and the blood poisonings the.
According to the inquiries in hospital, he has there until 28 decease of child of fewer of 10 years caused by the infections of pneumocoques.
Apart from Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the vaccination paid back.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
Advices concerning a possible obligation of vaccination in future ago the.
To leave January, she must be regular by the insurances and optional.
For example the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský has indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association promotes for years the vaccination against the pneumocoques.
At the time of an international conference in which our association has participated, the specialist have been really not satisfied of the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
This is not ideal.
Of an other side, we are happy to have cannot to impose at least this.
I think that this is a direction nearly at present to follow has announced Kalovský.
But the ministry of the health does not want to change the process of vaccination against the pneumocoques.
We do absolutely not view him for the moment, has announced his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The optional vaccination has his disadvantages, assert the physicians.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Société specialized of the paediatricians, recognizes only a vaccination based on the volontariata his flaws.
If all the children were vaccinated, would cannot to view a decline in the renewals of the vaccinations" in the situation the vaccine costs a such sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional "Cabrnochová said however.
The specialists expect that from the next year, more of 80 percent of the new parent will make to vaccinate their infants.
The vaccination against the pneumocoques marks a breaking as because this is child who are financed by the insurances and not not the state's first vaccination.
Cabrnochová explains that would have to release bottoms for the prevention, they would thus economize on future possible medical cares.
The physicians will have to buy their products themselves
This is however connected to the worries of the paediatricians practitioner, who concern the purchase of vaccine.
The original intention was that to buy the vaccines the insurances, the physicians receiving the same way only the other thick products of vaccine by the state.
Certain deputy however feared that this would allow the assurances in order "to deduce the sums from the health insurance".
So, will have to buy the products and to wait reimburse them them.
According to the appraisals, the paediatricians will individually have to invest nearly 40000 crowns per month in vaccine, this who are an important sum.
Will be far from that to be easy, according to Cabrnochová.

Can the Islam be French?
The pluralism and the pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Certain reader will be attracted by this new book, admirer of the last work "of the author, do the Frenchmen not like the scarf"( 2006), an and well well-informed elegant study on a problem and the country divided a fifteen of year and of the worried effect make still feel today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents an and more ambitious well more wide framework.
He good anthropologist, does not wish only to know this the politicians and the media say which on the Islam in France, but this who dispenses currently in the country.
He has passed numerous months in the mosques, the schools and the institutes this which Mr. Bozen calls Muslim" spaces" for the 5-6 m of Muslim provide France.
All right knows that to listen and to reproduce the debates between teacher and pupil about the questions who concern them the more.
Must a Muslim himself get married in a mosque or at the town hall( or both)?
Must the evolution and the rights of the homosexuals be taught to the young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman one Muslim women marry a no- Muslim?
Can a Muslim one Muslims use a banking system based on the interests in order to get a loan?
This are these practical problems, he asserts, who are the daily prize, rather than the dramas politician who worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imam, of teacher and of intellectual, all unknown of the mainstream, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a born Arabic Muslim in Swiss.
Tries to opening the debate about the way to be at once a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the the end.
The conservatives do not believe in the idea of an or European French Islam.
The intellectuals and the activists who of our days who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyer of a puriste Islam Sunni associate in Saudi Arabia, constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr. Bowen estimates that would cannot the worth of the Musulmans and the secularism of the Frenchmen to be compatible.
But a compromise can be elicited only with the efforts from each camp.
He asks the French politicians (and the elite intellectual so virulent attendant of the secularism) am really committed towards the pluralism.
According to him, the Musulmans have been not spoiled, with respect to the the the Catholiques, at the Protestants and at the Jews who who have equally had to do historical compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a pragmatism growing, he detects a" narrowness of the worth key".
Can the Islam be French? After reading of this book, one is tempted to say" yes, but not yet. "
The sight the more dark of the world
The Arctic changes more quickly and of way more dramatic than all other place on the planet.
The ice who make him up am in the process of to melt at an alarming speed, taking with her a life who can survive somewhere else.
The oil, the gas, the expeditions and the fishing are sailing in new open waters, with the diplomats, the lawyers and maintaining writers in their wake.
In" Sur one thin coats of", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the big north, the polar bear.
Connoisseur of the story and of the intricate policies of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of the explorers of the Arctic who made their evidence hunting the polar bear.
The meeting of the admiral Nelson then brave, aspirant of 14 year who in order to fight of his musket, only the point is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bear-cubs, caught while they were swimming at the sides of their mother, all exactly killed, and sent in the caught zoos and circuses.
In the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 bears simultaneously.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always generally a millionth of the surface necessary at an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely appropriate: A living polar bear in Singapore has became green because of the seaweed who pushed in his thick fur.
To click here for more than news!
Mr. Ellis tells the story of other writer and historian and is often receding from the threat the hunters on the survival of the specie pose which.
Well only forbidden in Norway, in America and in Russia, the slaughter continue at the Greenland and at the Canada the hunters in helicopter and the Indian Inuits in motoski use of the fusilsd' assault puissants in order to fowl.
Ironically, this is in the waters the more north of these two nations of the hunting the ice will stay the more a long time.
In his new book," Après freezes her", which Alun Anderson, of New Scientist, a former editor affords an and frightening summary clear of the science of the Arctic and a fascinating insight of this perhaps being the future there.
Only the scientists not have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes neither the océanographes can relate with accuracy the speed of the changes.
This not am through lack of to try.
Thin XIXème and beginning XXème, the journeys pionniers of Fridtjof Nansen have given the first information on the casting of the icecap.
The submarines of the cold war have then mapped the changes of relief under this one.
The satellites surveillance and the placed probes on the icebergs are of a big help, but the more big of the eastern work made by the hard-bitten men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the and minuscule extraordinary world of the system reliant on the arctic ice, formed by the net of hurried brackish water freezing him.
But of the bear recalled above at the restrained microscopic wonders in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice of summer, expected between 2013 and 2050.

Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country in order to go to receive rewards but the authorizations have been always refused.
The holding of an American national is perhaps going to increase the tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the administration Obama who pursues an approach" mild" in order to improve the relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest has been first brought back by the New York Times, Friday night.
The new American policy presses ahead so that the Cuban government is advancing by stage concrete, such than to release the political prisoners and to create more than of space for the opposition, in order the United States can give back the alike.
The mobile phones and the portable computers are authorized in Cuba, although this is new consumer goods and wanted in a country or the salary medium of one civil servants is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; They are mainly used for the textos or for a conversation of 15 minutes who corresponds to a day of salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely restricted.

The Pakistani authorities prevent a plot in order to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have spotted an organization supposed to prepare a plot in order to send five men of Virginia of the North in Afghanistan with the aim of to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this matter would allow that to take down an important network of recruiter of terrorist who skim internet in search young man intensified.
The investigators have claimed that they hunted an hidden insurgente personality, known under the name of Saifullah who has invited these man to the Pakistan after to have discovered them when one of them has made comment approving the terrorist spate on the site of video YouTube on the Internet.
Happened at the Pakistan, these men have been guided by, home of al-Qaida and of his training camp terrorist.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services who have been informed of the matter has said Saturday that had not succeeded to convincing al-Qaida's commanders that these men did not participate in the plot of the CIA in order to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thereby, they have been insulated during the days in the oriental city from Sargodha, far the mountain forbidden of the North-East grown one refuge of the terrorism.
They have been considered as agents infiltrated.
Therefore they have been rejected, has announced a representative of the authorities who have expressed to the condition to keep the anonymity because of the confidential characters of the matter.
The representative of the authorities has claimed that the men were determined and that always tried to getting the authorizations necessary in order to get the entry in al-Qaida's camps when they have been stopped by the Pakistani strengths of law.
The case of these five man-- who stay at the Pakistan and who is questioned by the FBI-- insist on the and perhaps more important crucial role of the recruiters in potential terrorist's identification, in the determination of the persons to grant his confidence.
Since the attacks of the 11 September 2001, the American secret services for priority to infiltrate of the men in the network al-Qaida.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of custody- fence, refusing the entry to this who who do not show a serious commitment and this who can turn out to be spies.
According to the analysts, the potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are equally very attractive for the group because of their potential access to the American targets and their propagandaire worth.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the Fondation NEFA based in the United States, has declared that the terrorist groups must as pay attention more and more, these last years in the choice of the persons which they accept for the American secret services have became experts with respect to their methods of recruitment.
If try to infiltrating someone in these groups, what good way only to follow his model of recruitment which such others person have already followed? Has said Kohlmann.
The model is this who is more and more on the Internet.

The medium result of the whites has been not included in the results of the tests for the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overview on a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the distance is entering the blacks and the whites in class of Grade 4( cm1), when the first report NAEP of the District was published, was 60 point( 262 at 202).
Although the results got by the children in the two groups have increased at the course of this period, the difference has only amounted to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District have expressed the anxiety only the rise celebrated by the Directrice of group of establishment of teaching Michelle Rhee and the Maire, Adrian Mr. Fenty( Démocrate) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
Would like to saying that we have brought up the aggregate while considering the elements at the top of the scale, this who are problematic and bothering, have said Jeff Smith, director of Voice, an à but non lucratif group who defends the equality in the education of the District.
I am not jumping joy for an or two point earned, has announced Kwame Brown related( democrat), Membre the of the council of and the girl is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary elementary( school).
Often criticize style of management of Rhee, Brown has declared that the message of the results of test is only the schools middle( college) of the city desperately need for attention.
Really, you always want to see the gestures positive and I respect him.
But this who makes fear, this is that we do not devote to sufficiently of time and of energy at our schools middle( college).
Rhee has declared that had to continue to finding good ways to answer at the needs students struggling.
This autumn, for example, certain teacher has been formed in order to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aiming the schoolboys of the classes of end cycle elementary and beginning of college who not integrated the bases of the reading plus early in their course school and are enough late per report in order their comrades.
Each day, the program of mathematics, for the classes of Kindergarten( motherly) at Grade 6 (6ème puts the accent in the games and the experiences of the real life, such than they have been put in place in the District by the responsible former Clifford Janey who must be credited for the progress to the NAEP reported last week.
I quite simply think that he necessary us to continue to working in order to offer good interventions to these pupils of level inferior at this of the class, has said Rhee.
Others estimate that the results of the NAEP are putting down the matter of learning if can continue to bringing up the general results of the system while providing with the money and the resources for the schools with less good results in order to close the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, has said Bruce Fuller, a formative of the teaching at the University of Berkeley in California who study the results of the tests of the cities.
The conventional political solution is that to devote your resources and your reforms of management to the situated schools in the areas the more poor of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political repercussions who bother this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the others Superintendant of the schools, tries to using the middle class the of the whites and of the blacks.
We are concentrating in order to assure the development of a system of good school.
He necessary us to reinforce our schools of area in order only all the families, what only either the place of where they are native, are provided will their children cannot to get an excellent public education.
Janey, maintaining Superintendant of the schools of Newark, has announced in an interview this week, only one of the elements essential in order to cut back the distance of étaitla success of the usual public school, today of 180 days in the District of Washington, in order to be in competition with the schools Charter.
He necessary to get about 200 days in order the strength to change, has said Janey, who in east driven at an agreement with the trade union of his teacher the last year in order to get 185 day, does he consider a" starting point" in order to get still an increase in the next contract.
To make the superior education a promise of future
The bus has stopped in Gettysburg College with a long hissing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, is getting him off and blinks an instant of the eyes at the sight of the white columns, façades of brick and verdant lawns.
Had only cannot to finish the secondary school, in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, has been born at Silver Spring and who at Riverdale, had never put the feet in an academic campus.
As, while she and others students of Grade 8( 4ème of the group have explored Gettysburg where the expenses of schooling are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less this of a new student impressed only enthusiastic.
super Voilà I am going to study! Has exclaimed Graciela who who would wish to study the medicine, while the guide ran them towards the entry of the building of the sciences.
Youpi, really? He says pensive, when one pointed out to him the weak ratio professor of right-- studying.
The University of Pennsylvanie was the septième which the children during their journey of discovery of three days visited and now, he had completely integrated the message: The question is not that to know if you are going into the university:
The question am.
Although this question is still widely arising for born American child of Hispanic immigrés parent who have left the secondary school where have became parent's big number at the adolescence, they are equally hundred of thousand to benefit from the academic teaching who will allow them to enter the class average.
In fact," a Hispanic of the second" generation" on cinqpoursuit his studies at the secondary school-- a success notable if one considers only so much of their immigrés parents, most of the Mexico or central America, have gone in in the United States without to have ended the secondary school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they open the lane the next generation who will play a role important in the hand of work of the country.
The researchers who study the flaps claim that this one have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to pan out.
Numerous are equally this the parents determine high objectives at their children whose and who find the means to balancing their lack of familiarity out with the American schools.
mentorat's programs equally play a role very important in order to help Graciela and million of child like her to arrive at the university-- in particular, if his efforts are regular and in the long term.
When you look on the children of the families at weak income of the parents what intervention who do not have the experience and the competences in order to help them to sail in the system, number'imports, at any what time, will not help, has said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied the Latin-American student.
He necessary us to think to offer a network of support to these children, of the motherly until the the secondary school.
The federal program who has financed the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known under the name of GEAR UP( prepare you), provide with more than of $300 million per year at systems of local school in order to organize the programs of school preparation at the university who start when the students of family of weak income are in middle( college) and continue until the end years of secondary school.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than of 10 million of student, with more than of 60 percent going in for the university, according to the American ministry of the Education.

Despite the anxieties on the violence and the political instability, has succeeded to attracting societies oil important in order to rebuild his infrastructure struggling during two bids who have ended Saturday.
The 10 received agreements by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with the foreign societies oil suggest, only Russia and Europe are that to play a major role in the reduction in statehood of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated.
The American societies have left with a participation in only two of the 10 fields put in the bids.

The lonely who had put on a bid has lost.
Two American societies have got contracts for the fields put in the bids in June.
The weak representation of the American giants oil in the opening of the sector oil in Iraq has surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened his doors, after six years of war, and instead of American society, and European Asiatic societies who open the lane, have declared Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
He will necessary many of front time only one other offers either made in Iraq.
The anxieties on the security, corroborated by the massive coordinated bombardments, Tuesday, and the instability political then that the American military troops withdraw slowed down the American societies oil, preventing them to going in with more than of strength for Iraq who own the more big third réserve of oil raw of the world, say the analysts.
The American societies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and the other energizing societies controlled by one governments, of the costs of hand works were notably inferior and were more ready who of the risks for they had step to give back count in order shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and western Petroleum Inc. have been the lonely American societies to get contracts with the ministry.
The American societies the more important, such than Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have supported strong tie-ups with the ministry of the Iraqi oil and have brought to him their technical advices, have left the empty hands.
The societies Russian Lukoil and Gazprom have been the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
Have more enchéri on the contracts than others societies and has left with the important participation in the contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is by train that to become a major economy, as well as a technological power, have declared Assam Jihad, spokesman of the ministry of the oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be even with his competitors and his commitments in Iraq.
The selected societies in order to subject bids have bid who have been then compared to the rate by barrel was agreed to pour which in order to justify the production above the the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed at the Pakistan
He seems only an American missile, having knocked along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaida, this week, have announced Friday American authorities of the counter-espionage.
If the news is confirmed, that would be the second deadly attack on an of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
al-Somali Saleh was one of the two Arabic men suspected have summer killed by one pairs of missile thrown in their car, Tuesday, close of the city of Miran Shah.
The local authorities have claimed that the missiles had been pulled by an airplane without pilot of the used type by the CIA, inside the anarchic tribal border of the Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car has been hit, has ruled a member of the civilian secret service Pakistani, expressing to the telephone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority have declared that the suspect local militants have rushed at place and have quickly confiscated this who stayed utterly jagged" bodies".
He has been utterly impossible at the local authorities of to check the identity of the victims, but the two American terrorist representatives have given evidence not spécifiées that Somali belonged of the deaths.
Somali was described like being one of the responsible military organizers of al-Qaida who ran the terrorist operations of the group hors of the area Afghanistan- Pakistan.
His role was that to organize plots all over the world, has asserted one of the authorities who who have wished to keep the anonymity, quoting the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside the the Pakistani territory.
Considering his central centrality, this probably understood conspiracies of attack on the United States and Europe.
He has followed the strategic instructions of the leaders of al-Qaida and has translated them into line of attack for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority has declared that Somali had progressed quickly in al-Qaida''s s ranks and very extremist good relations with others groups in the area.
That is perhaps not known of the big American public, but done not reduce the threat he constitutes pro we and our allies, have said the second representative official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September's second important character, when a similar attack has killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militant in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rhythm of the attacks made by the drones of the CIA has reduced ever since the summer, of about six operations per month at two, according to the advanced figures by the long War Journal, an à but non lucratif moderate site Web by a group.
This decline is perhaps due to the tactics improved of the terrorist groups have progressed in order to reduce their vulnerability while equally killing mercilessly the informants suspected, asserts the site.
The special correspondent of the UN in Kabul withdraws
The special correspondent of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, has declared Friday that he was going to resign of his post in March, at the end of a stormy mandate tainted of allegation of extensive corruption during the the steady presidential election by the UN.
The start of Eide intervenes while the administration Obama has decided to send 30000 additional soldiers in Afghanistan.
The messenger of the UN has said he supported this increase but he has expressed his anxiety concerning the calendar of the United States for a withdrawal of the troops who would start in 18 months and who would require the other governments of NATO to remove their strengths.
He necessary us to speed up the development of our strengths of security in Afghanistan, to send the good signal at the Afghans and their to remind that they can have confidence in the community internationale, have declared Eide in one maintenance telephone of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has equally squeezed the United States and the other military might to increase international civil servant helping the political transition in Afghanistan's number.
Must the military increase to be copied by the civilians, he has said.
Eide have announced he did resign step but what he would simply respect the commitment he had which busy towards his family, in March, to pass only two years to Kabul
He has said that he wanted to warn the United Nations.
The secretary-general Ban Ki-moon knows now that he time to find a substitute.
I have simply said that he worth to better begin to seeking my substitute, has said Eide.
When I have come here, he had there had an emptiness of two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the UN, has already begun to looking for a substitute.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; He is a matter of a citizen Italo-Suisse who has recently presided over a mission of the UN in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously run the operation of preservation of the peace of the UN.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put in the test after his former deputy, Peter Galbraith, had accused, in September, to favour the President Hamid Karzai during the the presidential election and to conceal the evidence of a massive ballot rigging.
Eide has denied these allegations but he has announced only the accusations of Galbraith -- who has been thanked --" have carried damage at the mission for he had there already a good dose of scepticism with respect to the international observation of the éléctions".
Eide has declared that he had proposed the appointment of a representative civilian in order to coordinate the helps of the American strengths in Afghanistan.
He has equally pressed ahead next to the the Responsables of the UN so that they authorize his successor to hire more than of personnel coming from the of the United States and of other western country he is assigned at the mission in Afghanistan, saying which would afford more of confidence on the way their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration concerning the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the heavy regulations of hiring of the UN bothered his possibilities to bring new talents.
The rules of the UN are such than has cannot to recruit than since May, a lonely person has said.
This is catastrophic and that can last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The secretary at the Défense, Robert Mr. Gates has declared Friday that the big world powers were going soon to impose" important additional sanctions" on Iran because of his incapacity to commit in the talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressing in front of a flowerbed of 300 American soldiers north of Iraq, during a visit of a in the area of war in Afghanistan and in Iraq, week has dédramatisé about the possibility of an Islamic military action against the republic.
It exists no good option in Iran, he has said, in response to the matter of a soldier on the possibility of a such outcome.
One of the things who weigh the more, am only if I have taught a thing in Iraq the courses of the six last years, this is well the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The administration Obama considers a set of sanction who would aim at the military elite and politician of Iran, but Gates has reported only sure of would equally cannot to affect the Iranians of the street.
He has declared that a "together motivations and punishments" would cannot to be necessary in order to persuade the Iranian government that he would be in fact in less good security with the nuclear weapons" then" his people would tremendously suffer'this sanction.
Friday, in a statement of the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has met the European leaders in a warning Iran will make against the probable consequence"" if he does not bring his nuclear program in total conformity with the Security Council of back the UN and his body of surveillance, the agency Internationale of the atomic energy( AIEA).
Persists to saying that he wants to develop his nuclear experience exclusively in a peaceful goal.
In the talks of Geneva, the 1er October, he has indicated that he would take back the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and he accepted to give up an important part of his storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately necessary for a jet engine of medical research.
The administration has pushed a such agreement, mean to develop a confidence of the two sides and to save time for the negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have gone away from the agreed attempts-- in part, say the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact that to commit or not with the United States.
Frankly, according to me, the raidissement of Iran against some of the proposal of the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement in the beginning of October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join hereupon they did have step viewed, in term of sanction additional important counter the Iranians, has announced Gates.
The President Obama has determined the 31 December as date limits to Iran in order to answer the proposal before he is turning towards others options, including the pursuit of this the secretary of statehood Hillary Rodham Clinton one times stepped-up" sanctions" called.
In a statement done Thursday to New York, the mission of Iran at the United Nations denounced this she calls" groundless allegations" certain members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and asserted was she agreements in order to continue the talks with the United States and five big other world powers", in order to get a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who who had to go back in Washington late Friday, has met the morning, the Iraqi premier, al-Maliki Nouri, before to choose the airplane as the rich area oil of Kurdish in order derencontrer the Responsables of the troops at Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arabic majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, the proprietary rights and the dividing of the incomes.
Gates has exhorted both gone to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delay of the American plans of reduction of the number of American troop, of 115000 at 50000 before the end of the month of August.
Gates equally wishes to calm the anxiety of the Kurds concerning the withdrawal on hold. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, preside over regional government of the Kurdistan: "We will protect your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within an Iraq unified".
We will not give you up. "
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and his husband have grown surrounded of bill of propaganda lecturing them," the land mother is too tired in order to welcome more than of child "and" a baby on top of that, this is a grave moreover".
They have so well learned the lesson the authorities of the government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient rate of birthrate of their city and by the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and has begun to encouraging the young couples to have pleased of a child; Their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: Never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy a lonely child.
And who has left us no second he, has said Wang, 31 years, main of the human resources a son of 8 months.
More than of 30 years after the introduction of the only child in China's policy, creating two generations of only child notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, the small" emperor", a crisis of the population threatens the country. dubbed
According to the UN, the medium birth rate has fallen of 1.8 child per couple with respect to six when the policy has been implementation.
The distribution of the population, while he is expected that the number of resident of 60 years more than and will explode, of 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 at 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This unsteadiness is still worst in the coastal rich cities one very educated populations, such than Shanghai.
The last year, and more the persons of 60 years imagined nearly 22 percent of the population of the residents recorded in Shanghai, while the birth rate was fewer of a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Directeur of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning commission( Commission of the Population Municipale of Shanghai and Planning Familial) has declared that the fertile couples had to have babies in order to help to cut back the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a lack of hand in order strive in future ".
Shanghai is that to grow" as old -- but not as rich, however -- only the countries developed such than Japan and Sweden" he has said.
A progressive extenuation
Country in 1978 written in the constitution the eastern only child to date, without, 's Chinese policy contests, the obligation the more controversial introduced by the communist government.
Risk the couples who contravene this policy to having to pay for huge fines -- until three faiths their yearly income-- and to undergo a discrimination on the workplace
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police the duty to help the country to avoid a tendency dangerous for his natural natural resources, while the lawyers of the right of the man have denounced the abuses in the execution of this policy.
In the rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women of a second child to fail.
Of more than, numerous couples have drawn at the selective abortions taking to a ratio boy -- girl abnormally high.
These last years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the only child's policy.
In 2004, they have granted more than of exception to the rule-- included for the resident of the cities, the ethnic members of the minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already only children-- and in 2007, they have softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the of Institute Population Research( Institut of research on the population), at the University of Peking, has declared that the authorities of the government central have recently discussed still more step changes, such than to authorize the couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has became the first Chinese city to throw an aggressive country in order to encourage the births.
In a nothing of time, the posters encouraging the families only one lonely children have been substituted by the and how who does have the right to have a second child to make the demand for authorization.
The government of the city has dispatched officials of the family planning and volunteers in order to meet couples, at home domicile, and flyers under their door.
He has equally promised to provide with and financial psychological advices this would wish who more of a lonely child.
According to the official of the family planning, the answer has been disappointing.
Disappointing answer
Although the responsible in one cities rural of the suburb of Shanghai say that they have seen an increase of the demands for file of couple wishing for one second children after the launching of the country, the more urban district has reported that he had there no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population 115000 inhabitant, for example, always receives only four at five requests per month.
The officials of Shanghai, disappointed, claim that despite the country, the number of the births in the city, in 2010, is always foreseen to be only about 165000 -- slightly superior to 2009 but inferior at 2008.
Feng Juying, Responsable of the board of the programme family in the common of Shanghai, Caolu has declared that the financial considerations are probably the main reason for which numerous persons do not want to have pleased of child.
Want to provide for their first child, he has said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 year, have declared that would love to having two child and were they are legally there authorized.
But like many of Chinese, they have exclusively the insurance health minimum and the insurance life given by the government.
Without a social welfare, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The westerners wrongfully consider that the only child's policy is a problem of right, has announced Yang, one engineer in building whose the woman is enclosure of seven month of the first child of the couple.
This is true, one is stealing the chance more of a lonely child.
But the problem is not only the law.
This is the money.
Others couples quote psychological reasons in order to explain their hesitation.
What Wang, of the human resources, Responsable has said she wanted only an only child for she was a herself. "We were the centre of the family and had the habit handle us."
We do not used to take care of someone else and we do really not wish to take care of the others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years owner and of a society of translation, says him more bluntly.
For the couples working for two, of middle class, who make fall the birth rate, he says, nearly he to be selfish in order to well pan out.
The people of 20 or 30 years have grown while seeing their parents fight in the first times of capitalist China and the people of 20 or 30 years do not want to have themselves this lifestyle, say.
Even a lonely child asks many of time of his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of his social life.
Then he has there the problems of space--" Il necessary you to change your flat"-- and the planning"-- when your child has 9 months, he necessary you to write his CV in order to get a motherly place in the good. "
Most of his friends are ready at this experience one times, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the première to benefit from a superior standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifice.
The group of the United Nations has plans of plan for the reduction of the emissions
The conference on the climate, sponsored by the UN-- characterized up to now by the disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations-- returned under the limelight Friday, because of the publication of a document underlining the reductions highflyer of the gases at effect of claw during the the 40 next years, with the industrialized nations supporting most the load, in the next time.
The text who would cannot to provide with the bases of a final political agreement in order to regulate the greenhouse gases, has underlined the remaining obstacles, as much than he has lighted the way to take.
But he has been seen like being an important advance in the negotiations who miss time, with more than of 100 leaders of the whole world arriving next week at Copenhague.
Written by a special working groups of the UN, the text does not say how much the rich countries would give at the paupers in order to support the climatic warming, at and long-term yard.
And he affords a wide range of option for the questions key, understanding the way of the economies developed and would cannot to reduce their production of carbon the superior limit of the increase of the temperature would be world-wide and what the officials would be ready to tolerate which.
He gives a big flexibility the process, has said John Coequyt, representing in Washington sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, which who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiation of 180 pages in order to concentrate on this the executive secretary-general on the climate change has described the UN, Yvo of Boer, like being" the complete picture".
He shows the main lines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would pound collectively their emissions to 2020, of 25 at 45 percent with respect to the the levels of 1990, then only the main countries in of development, during the same period, would cut theirs back of 15 at 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce the emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050.
The European Union has equally revived the negotiations, Friday, while promising to provide with $3,6 billion per year during the three next years in order to help the countries the more poor to conform to the impact of the climate change -- in order to support the floods and the dryness or in order to avoid the deforestation.
Yet, Friday, the same verbal altercations have happened, who has dominated the negotiations ever since last week.
Todd Stern, representing United States in order the climatic negotiation has rejected all discussion forcing the reduction of the greenhouse gases by the industrialized countries, compared with the the voluntary efforts achieved by the main émergeantes economies, if this one were not financed by the countries developed.
This change is the signal the administration Obama grows more hard towards China than the administration Bush has her summer, two years ago.
Are not going the United States to sign an agreement without effort and action with the main countries in the process of development, says Stern who equally regretted that the text does not insist enough in order to check that would cannot the reductions to be checked by the.
Stern which has made his Chinese comments one hours after only the vice-ministre the foreign affair, He Yafei has declared only the American main negotiator, either missed" common sense", either was" extremely irresponsible" in order to have said early in the week the United States would not help financially China in order to fight at the climatic warming.
With the future economical trajectories of the main world powers at stake, flaws have appeared at once within the the Third World and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle concerns more the rescue of the individual economies only the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States quarrelling on their respective obligations while the more poor nations press ahead on the made only the two dozens of influential country the more ignore the requirements scientific to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of the Costa Rica, has declared that he was not surprising that the main powers beat learning who who would have to undergo the costs of the reduction of the greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable country had grown more aggressive in their attempt to give back the émetteurs big official of their action.
This is really a game in which is developed a new hegemony economical, has said Ulate, in which who is equally Conseiller on the climate for Mexico and central America for Conservation International.
Sure of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of the climate change have pointed out would continue to putting on the pressure in order to get a treaty legally forcing, in Copenhague, well which the plupart of the main participants say that the negotiations will lead at the minimum, at a political agreement.
The Alliance of the small insular states who gathered 43 members, has written a proposal of treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Chef of the unit climate of the European Commission, dit that the action of the small insular states has" mis one political pressures on the complete political process", in part by this they are keeping unified and only they ask at the émergeantes economies such than the China and India, to act
The debates have became a matter of urgency, while the delegates were concentrating on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in front authority the heads of government are happening to an agreement.
Of the officials of high level such than the Ministre of the Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Vice-ministre chinois have taken down their airplane and have rushed in the building of the Bella Center in order to attend the meeting in huis-clos and at the conferences of news, in order to cannot to make complaints who will be studied during the next week.
The true picture of the gathering 13000 persons are going in and of the convention centre the each day-- of the activists player of guitar introduce of the nocturnal spectacles laughing at the countries who according to them, betray proposal is rédigées and distributed on paper rather only by emails -- constitute a truth challenge.
The intensity make only increase: Almost all the important ministers are here and not later on that Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhague.
We are going in for the yard of the big, has announced Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for the world-wide policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are arriving.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h is going to redefine the syndrome of the Monday
At numberModel, Mondays morning, a peal of whistle will pierce the night in order to indicate the start of a train who will mark a revolution of the transport in Great Britain.
The first commuter train at big speed of the country will reach 225 km/h, while he will spin Ashford, in the Kent, at London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the minister of the Transports, will be met aboard the the first commuter trains Javelin out of London by Dame Kelly Holmes.
He hopes that the new service will allow Great Britain to integrate an international network of and reliable fast train and will bind the big conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small backwoods will become flourishing cities of suburb, the durations of the journeys of business will well be less length and the passage of the airplane and of the car at the train will cut back the national emissions of carbon while reducing the traffic jams on the roads.
Conceivably, the three main political parties adhere to this plan.
Risk to slowing down the British lines at big speed.
According to The Times, High Speed Two( HS2), one societies created in January in order to achieve for the government of feasibility, one reports will give his document back to Lord Adonis the 30 December.
That will allow him to elicit a detailed card from the route of the next expected stage for the network at big speed.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the urban area and sites where will cannot the environmental impact to be controversial.
In the country, the plan will be drawn until 25 meters of the final route.
He is equally expected that HS2 presents three options for a more big network at big speed, going northwards north.
Lord Adonis will answer the springs.
The favoured options are put forwards in a configuration in Y one lines at big speed will go into the the West Midlands.
The line will part in two at or nearly with Birmingham, with one branches leaving for the west of the Pennines in Manchester and shells and an other going vers le nord-est, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
An unique line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the good option of performance" has said a professional of the rail.
When this will be finished, the time journey between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, who will not open beforehand 2025, will allow all the passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, with respect to a journey of an hour currently.
The proposals will allow the trains to travel at 400 km/ h, making the British network the more fast of the world.
Am conceived of in order to allow trains of 400 m of length and to transport 1100 persons.
Until 18 trains per hour can function on a line London-- Birmingham.
A terminal can welcome 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Being given the space constraints, he is expected that an existing station will be extended in order to receive the network at big speed.
The experts of the rail industry the announce only only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce if he or nay thinks that the plan must start place, but of the more long public consultations planning procedures and mean that a final decision will be not made before a general election.
Even if he throws the machine, the network will have being built part per part.
The trains will foremost be bound to wheel hors lines at big speed on the existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping durations of journey between London and shell superior to three hours.
Seems this solution to be the good in order to provide a passage of the airplanes at the trains, constituting a point of reference for the revolution of the rail.

The physicians pointed out Friday will have to put back a report before the 10 March 2010 while in particular saying at what periods if has cannot to find in state of weakness and.

Managerial Révolution or end of the economical intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French enterprises, our fight for the development the economical intelligence having summer hollow
Since more than of a ten of year, the attitude of the big enterprises opposite his wage-earners, management calls again the position of the enterprises opposite the the consumers before the revolution marketing: He is a matter to adhere to the collaborators at the focussed" worth" of upstairs as he was a matter once, to impose on the consumer product thought by the technician of the factory
While putting on the customer at the heart of the enterprise, the revolution marketing has put back the strategies of conquest of the markets the right way round... Well only the authoritarian temptation to impose unconnected products of the factors of preference of the clientèles is regularly returning!
A demobilization of the employees can lead to a mortifère demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the émergée part of a much more general phenomenon who in particular touch the frames.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, among others the R&D and, more still, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE" requires from all the stake-holders () a proactive approach and a prospective sight "; She requires on behalf of the the employee a commitment totally bother.
Therefore we call upon a managerial revolution who would consist to putting the collaborators at the center of the the worries of the enterprise in the same title only the customer.
The all relative usefulness of the inquiries of internal opinion
The inquiries of opinion internal– like the questionnaire subjected by Orange to his wage-earners be-- they going to incite to this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I do only nay fear.
- First because has cannot to notice that, against a new situation, all structure manages in the end, after bien of the detours, to make first and foremost this which she has always made.!
- Then, parce l' authoritarianism– an of the pathology of the power-- grows in proportion to the importance of his own chess.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic sight of the human behaviour.
Born of the big schools of engineer, they have a mechanistic interpretation of the psychology.
They adopt, per intellectual comfort, the old theory behaviourist, revived recently by the états-uniennes" neurosciences" and widely broadcast, at their insu, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, while suggesting that is possible to handle the" levers"( sic) of the commitment of the frames, a recent inquiry of Ipsos parue in the Figaro.fr she reinforces the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, misfit at the world of today.
To identify and to size the factors of mobilization
At the opposite, the necessary managerial revolution at the good working of the modern enterprises, suppose to adopt a sight finalist of the human behaviour.
Consists to integrating, in all reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental report: For the wage-earners, the commitment for the enterprise is possible only if this one clearly appears like a mean to achieving a part of their dreams, of their ambitions, of their plans.
Currently, lonely the studies born of the motifonctionnelle Analyse adopt this conception of the motivations of the employees.
These studies have proved that they judge their enterprise while being based on a doxa predetermined who allows them, across their picture perceived of the enterprise, to evaluate this which she offers to them in order to achieve their plans of life
Thanks to the identification and worthy of these factors of mobilization, the ruling of enterprise can control, to foresee and to anticipate their social" performance" and to put their management of the human resources" the right way round" back.
They thus create a ground favourable for the concerted development of an and effective robust economical intelligence.
Speech of Oslo: The true" war" earns louanges right Obama
The American right has greeted Friday the speech pronounced the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied with that the price Nobel of the peace 2009 have defended the concept of true" war" on the enemy of the United States.
The conservatives, who had brocardé about the awarding of the price at Mr. Obama the 9 October, have applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate at vice-presidency at the time of the the election of 2008.
I have liked this which he has said, has announced Mrs. Palin, muse of the right-wing of the gone republican, to the daily wore out Today, adding asset herself the theme of the war" sometimes necessary" in his memories are coming from being reached publiés.
The war is of course the last thing at my advice that want to make, but she is necessary.
He necessary to stop these terrorists all there, she has estimated.
Who Mr. Obama, has inherited two wars from his predecessor George Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, has devoted Thursday in Oslo to justify the appeal at the strength, a way to explain his decision to send 30000 additional soldier in Afghanistan nine day early.
An other opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, has estimated that the president had done to Oslo" very good work".
I have found that the speech really all right were, if is congratulated the former president of the House of Representatives, who has particularly valued the mention of" the existence of the hurt in the world "in the presidential remark.
By some sides, I have found this tout-à-fait speech historical, has announced Mr. Gingrich, questioned at the time of the emission radio" The Takeaway".
The elder elected, considered by some a possible candidate at the republican investiture in order of 2012, the presidential election has said elated vu" a president left-wing "to remind the members of board Nobel" they would be not free would cannot to hand over a price of the peace so the appeal at strength existed not".
For Michael Gerson former, feather of George Bush columnist at the retrained Washington Post, Mr. Obama has delivered" a very American speech".
On top of that to turn up in" citizen of the world" like "he always makes him"," he has talked like an American president", reminding at the Europeans" that they live in a bubble of security they have not created which they make big step thing in order to protect her", has estimated Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare at right to be convinced step, an hawk of the era Bush, the former ambassador at the UN John Bolton, has described the speech as" dull, pompous and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
At the left of the president, has alarmed the representative democratic Dennis Kucinich to justify the appeal the strength.
When one wraps the war in the notion of justice, easily can to justify the slaughter of innocent, he has put in guard.
The press of centre-left however stayed laudatory towards the the president.
The Los Angeles Times, all continuing him at to think only the Nobel has been attributed prematurely to Mr. Obama, has described his speech as" blockbuster" even for an orator known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo" would have to serve road map in order to guide the international decisions against the conflicts, the poverty and the oppression ", if am set fire the Californian daily.
"Mr. Obama has delivered the speech he necessary which", has estimated the New York Times, judging it" at once dark and building".

The plan S21: A brake for Stuttgart
One can place enough high the breadth of the plan Stuttgart 21.
For his supporters this is nothing of less than the new" heart of Europe".
If one wants. S21, this is well more than the enfouissement of a station railway, plus only one huge plans of building who is going to plunge the heart of the capital of the Bade-Wurtemberg, in an appalling chaos of building site for a ten of year.
Stuttgart 21 has been born the mind of the years 80.
Park railhead, with the lanes who ended in full city, the reputation at the time of to be the relics of the technique of the transports of the nineteenth century who made effect clog of brake of the modern rail traffic for he necessary long ago many of time in order to go by the locomotive of the back in the front of.
Arrival short, stop, start– this is that nearly to make.
That's why park railhead must disappear: In Frankfurt and in Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: A parks passage of the trains, who finds midway environ on the transeuropéenne Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest/ Bratislava hence the slogan" heart of Europe".
The realization of the plan S21 is really going to start, although the sights of the years 80 are no longer for years compatible at the reality.
Even the planners the more ambitious have recognized that the cost, in order to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and of Bavaria, was outrageous.
As a matter of fact, park railhead are no longer arising really of problem of entry and of exit since it exists modern trains, reversible with rail-car and car- pilot at the two ends.
However one throws at present the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the the new routes of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
The and communaux regional politicians have taken him.
The company of the railways is the part then, this is the taxpayer who makes the expenses of the risks of the more big plan of infrastructure the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
Of the urbanistic viewpoint this plan leave justify.
One gets an urban space who– if one believes the graphs of the planners generated by computer– will be very verdant.
For the system of the rail transports the S21 is harmful.
The station of passage and the widening of the section are conceived for a traffic of person to whom one attributed-- and this is typical of the years 80-- an enormous growth.
At the time he did not yet exist the inexpensive competition of the flights.
The policy of the modern traffic would first have to concentrate on the reinforcement of the traffic of the merchandise for the transport by the rail is much more respectful of the environment only per truck on the road.
But the new route, with his inclines, does not suit at the trains goods merchandise.
The S21, and that much more serious east indirectly concerns well others plans railway.
For example, six billion of euro are going to be gobbled up in the Souabe's plan by.
This is the official figure.
Experts think that ten at fifteen billion are more realistic.
A thing is sure, in the next decade this money will lack for other points of junction obstruction in the network.
The list of the ministry of the transports all told mentions sixty big plans.
One of the more important is the widening of the section across the valley of the Rhine of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line is built at the slow motion.
Would be really urgent to press here thoroughly on the mushroom.
But the plan S21 makes the effect a clog of braking.
The route of the valley of the Rhine is in lane that to become the international neck of strangulation of the traffic of the merchandise, and this at the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment rendu concerning the airport
At the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the government of the Land has recalled the possibility to make call for the judgment of the administrative court of Hesse concerning the grounding air overnight.
The Ministre of the economy Dieter Posch( FDP) has announced only the coalition CDU/ FDP had charged with the expert to examine of the viewpoint legal the judgment rendu by the administrative court a document consisting of more than of 400 pages.

The leader of the group parliamentary SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to go back on their promise made before the elections and who consisted to banning the night flights. Otherwise, that will be considered as a total breach at a word given.
This is downright difficult to be authorized to hold his word, has said the leader of the greens Tarek Al-Wazir while alluding at the éléctoral slogan of the FDP" we keep our promises".
The minister Dieter Posch refutes the criticisms of Schäfer-Gümbel only the government claims attempts to authorizing all the same the night flights while exercising" of avocasserie and of craftiness ".
He necessary time to make a precise legal exam.
The coalition does not want to make decision on the basis of a first fast" impression".
He necessary only the legally reliable decision either, said Stefan Müller( FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of his fraction on the ban of the night flights is completely érronée.

Accelerated election
In the end all has all the same happened more quickly than expected.
At trouble two weeks after the dismissal of the current supporter of the post of editor Nikolaus Brender
The commission wished to vote last night in order to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who runs the editorial staff berlinoise of ZDF was the big favourite.
The chaine has however not wished to confirm-- officially-- the vote in order to not anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that he has there had equally the will to not harm more at the ZDF Markus Schächter's steward in case the proposal would be not accepted by the council of Administration.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, had need for the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the fence of the editorial staff of this publishing.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had offered the council of Administration to prolong of five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but that had been rejected.
Lonely 7 members of the council had declared favourable for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted counter. The dismissal per vote of Brender represented a burning failure well only foreseeable for Schächter.
Indeed, had already let to mean several weeks before the vote, to not want to lead back Brender to his post.
This is Roland Koch, the Ministre- President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had refused be extended while putting forward the fact that the audience figure of the emissions of news of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
This is the reason for which protests still took place, almost until the the vote, denouncing the trained growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end he had there same 35 experts in public right who had interfered with the debate what and who estimated the way to act of Koch was unconstitutional.
But that will have been useful for nothing.
Peter Frey: Who am?
Peter Frey has been born the 4 August 1957 at Bingen.
He has studied the sciences- politician, the pedagogy and the Romance languages( Spanish).
He has then worked for the Südwestfunk (organ radio of the Rhineland-Palatinate) and at the Frankfurter Rundschau German( daily of national range).
In 1983 he becomes editor within the ZDF foremost at the magazine of news" heute-journal"( newspaper of today).
Then his course continues: Of 1988 at 1990 he was the deputy of the rédacteur-en-chef of the time; Then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until in 1998 he was leader and presenter of the" Morgenmagazins" bimonthly( emission of news presented the morning); Until in 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF puis leader of the berlinoise editorial staff.
After the disgrace of Brender, while exactly has just the specialized revue Medium Magazin to be elected by journalist of the year, the Greens have announced that they would drop a constitutional plaint
The opponent of Koch at the council of Administration, the Ministre- President of the Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, has declared last week that the Länder would have to transform the ZDF's intergovernmental Traité in order the proposals of personnel of the steward can not be jammed by a partial political majority.
However, does not contemplate to asking the withdrawal of the political personalities member of the commissions of surveillance of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the probable successor of Brender had skilfully operated next to the the council of Administration while criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter were in a position to to propose him for rédacteur-en-chef's post without to lose the face, just as the council of Administration can elect him without only one the soupconne to place at the post a political supporter.
In the representations arithmetical of the parties liberal classified eastern, Frey left-wing.
Spring-clean in the academic studies
Partial success for the students: Afterwards an year of educational strike the ministers of the education and of the cultural matters of the Länder decide to prove more conciliatory: At the time of a meeting between the Ministres and the delegates of the conference of the rectors, one agreements have been put in the point stipulating that the conditions of work of the students Bachelor or Master had to be improved.
In future, would have to cannot be in a position to to come to end of their studies.
They have in particular put on accordpour to lighten the weight of the exams: An unique exam must allow that to close the selected module of study.
In addition, the work load will have to be reconsidée in order to guarantee" and acceptable realistic proportions".
The political authorities and the establishments of higher education wish to facilitate the gratefulness of the exams between the universities and abroad.
The Länder have moreover committed to organize more flexible common structural prescriptions for the connections of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, must not have there règlementation different from a Land at the other.
Less exams
All along of the estudiantines protests in last June, the Ministre of the education of the Länder and the rectors of university have relentlessly at the mouth the expression at the fashion: "étudiabilité".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The advice of accreditation has decided to reduce considerably the number of some exams: "Must normally cannot each module to be concluded by an unique exam", one one can read in a document of a trentaine page on the future entry condition to the academic cycle.
Reinhold Grimm, preside over advice of accreditation announces only while reducing clearly the load of the exams one would have to cannot to stop the skids, who considerably harmed at the étudiabilité.
The" étudiabilité" would moreover have to be, in future, the decisive criterion of the organization of the studies.
The modules just like the bottom must be examined carefully in order to see if one can not avoid this sensation of suffocation which one feels sometimes in the choice of the yards.
Hamburg/ Berlin-- according to the last knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition estimates that the minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg( CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Would have" to have the possibility and the necessary room for manoeuvre in order to allow and to favour the personal initiative".
The new règlementation will concern the access to the new academic cycles but will be equally adapted for the existing cycles.
These cycles must be" réaccrédités" all the 5 years, this who means however, that this is only in 2015 that will have been examined.
10 competent agencies of accreditation on the set of the federal territory depend ago advice of accreditation created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministres of the education had exercised a certain pressure on the Länder so that they press on the agencies in order and the not too strict diet of the exams is not too loaded by the programs.
In some Länder, the universities and the superior schools specialized have already agreed with their regional ministries in order to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is up to now the lonely Land to have given his agreement in order to grant more of mean to the development of the process of Bologna.
With these bottoms, the universities must organize of the programs tutorielset to reinforce the offices of pedagogical orientation as well as the offices of the exams and the service of the international relations
The Länder and the universities foresee for that a budget of 10 million of euro.
Beginning 2010, the government wishes to drop at the Parliament an amendment at the law on the establishments of higher education.
Following that he will no longer necessary to go by only a lonely exam in order to close his studies.
The organization of the studies will have to be more flexible, in addition nearly to cannot to guarantee the gratefulness grade sheets of other establishment of higher education and the access to the Master must be simplified.
Of here the end of the next year, l" étudiabilité" all the academic cycle will have being examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the matter of the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions have been valued but criticisms has heard.
The federal President of the union of the socialist students has made learning that he would wish that the organization of the educational policy does no longer dispense at the future" behind the closed doors" with the of the ministers and of the rectors of university.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students as concernées person would have to cannot to express a few.
The future diplomés of the received higher education one the Présidente of the delegates of the conference of the rectors( HRK) 's support Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful" he has said Thursday at the time of a meeting with the Ministres of the education Länder with which the HRK works on a common reform bill.
For the trade union of the education and sciences( GEW) the decisions busy in Bonn are not going enough far. He asks for the right and the possibility for each qualified Bachelor to register at a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller member of the management committee of the GEW request moreover that the Länder ensure the student Bachelor of today, he will have tomorrow sufficiently of place for the studies in Master and of the conditions of study as good than possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more of lecturer.
On the other hand, the Ministres of the education have not recalled the possibility to lighten the access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
This am by these words" Arrivée in Germany this and is beautiful, almost more than of test... "What does a work of the poet Werner Söllner start, he thématise in the bits of disturbing sentence, the experiences of a gagné dissident managed in Germany who does have but the freedom has lost simultaneously his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 at Banat in Romania, has been whole first professor of German and of English in Bucarest and, afterwards, director of collection in a publishing house for the youth before to settle in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner has received various literary price; In 1993 he held the chair very coveted of poetry of the university Goethe of Frankfurt and since 2002 he is main of the forum of literature of Hesse at artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt's house.
He has made much parler him in the not literary circles last Tuesday, at the time of whose German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate of a congress in Munich, was the theme" ".
Visibly destabilized and bothered, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized in front of his colleagues writer germano-roumains like Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he collaborated as informant for the police political Securitate.
Söllner has received in 1989 the price of the language German jointly with some from the participants.
The tests of enlistment had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "therefore someone has not known that to stand up to the tests of intimidation of the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter( IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the price Nobel for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary disputes with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the eastern literary stage shaken and in particular the community of the German authors native of Romania, by a case who clearly show the abysses and the meanness of a system policy, based on the surveillance police and the espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as much than one can say according to the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter has played a role, assure the specialist of the literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and he puts off the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
"Had cannot to snap him out of all the predicaments at the time of", according to Markel.
Markel has felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and ahead this public was unexpected, however the admission of one former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret service in fact am, not so surprising.
Germany am a pleasant réserve for the Securitate's spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper" Die Zeit", after to have read the 914 pages of his own file.
One can suppose that the victims will have made speculations and will have sometimes guessed what real names hid last the names of loan Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
On the contrary Germany where the consultation is entering time files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude opposite the inheritance of the file of the still very confused eastern Securitate.
A systematic clarification has been relentlessly thwarted and slowed down in the past years.
This is only in 1999 that a national advice corresponding at the institution Birthler has been created in order to work for the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate( CNSAS) but the return of the files has rather lagged ever since.
It exists since 2005 a law who defines the management of the archives.
Does the Securitate in still very big Romania either influence former members, confirmed by the interview of an elder responsible for the Securitate of Temesvar who, afterwards announces him of the reduction of the price at Herta Müller, Nobel expressed scornful trés way for the sake of the prizewinner.
She had a psychosis, one and in the end had questioned only a lonely time.
Thought that to cannot to express here, without no gene, under the shelter of the freedom of speech.
Indeed, well unavoidable questions are associated with the case Söllner as that so many times happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why doing maintain? Who has been despoiled? The level-headed reaction of the listeners, at the admission of Söllner, let to hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know the accusations and a feeling shame.
Who on the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, has received yesterday the price Nobel, this is no longer only a footnote.
Tumult at the Champions League
One had the impression that a representative was arriving there, drawee at four pins coming strait from a party of Christmas sympa, the manufacturer of article of sport had spread out his merchandise when the new coach VFB Christian Gross was going up at midnight less the quarter in one Mercedes ranks C, exactly has just to call an orange plastic bag of the supplier at the hand.
The man, whose attention the bald skull attracted, left behave in the city who was still foreign him.
Otherwise our quinquagénaire would have cannot to take himself the steering wheel– he had not drunk of alcohol and he was not no longer wild with happiness.
He after a pleasant evening but tomorrow he necessary to take back the work.
For is that now was going to start.
Early the words of the Swiss has just to bind three days were clear: "We have well reached the eighth of final", this east to say in the league champions thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let us to blind by the success. This will be a fight brutal in order to not fall again".
The big" work" waits for us Sunday.
There, he is a matter to repeat to Mainz the results of the league of the champions at the daily.
And he will necessary to surmount the weaknesses who have resurfaced after the three expeditious aims of Marica( 5.), Träsch( 8.) and Pogrebnyak( 11.)
Drawing lots
The huitième de finale of the Champions League (match outward journey 16. / 17. + 23./ 24 Feb/ match return 9. / 10. + 16./ 17. March) will be pulled at the fate the 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the entry in fulminante function of the successor of Babbel was therefore moderated.
And the joy was not moderated exclusively at this who had carried chance, who had transmitted to the professional of Stuttgart destabilized, a motivation without loophole and the pleasure in.
I been to see the players and I have told them they had to concentrate on their assets, I recommended to be more brave explained the" plumber of the souls" – Gross -- the takings of the success who ringed so bienmais who no longer did with effect with the trainer Babbel.
He has launched a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann -- partisan which Babbel-," in the soccer when it is one new impulses he sometimes dispenses with the things one would have never believed possible".
And Sami Khedira after the weeks of break for injury, was advancing at the rank good player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describing the" phenomenon" noted by a proverbial fresh" wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "This is someone who is passing at the action and requires the discipline.
This is this whose we need".
But apparently Babbel had missed him.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the cape, put in guard the manager Horst Heldt
For the time, VfB Stuttgart above all has need for persistence.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager well avoid to overestimating the victory against an and weak utterly outmoded defence of the Romanian guests.
They had also earned at Glasgow before four days plus late one bad awakenings at Leverkusen with the 0:4, opposed Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, indicated that they had well reached an of the objectives of the season but they had others which who were still well far.
We have not yet passed the difficult cape.
Only Heldt the day his 40e birthday has not the heart to make the party, even afterwards the first victory at home since three months, at the events of the weekend only one interviews televised of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made bounce exactly beforehand the beginning of the match.
He has there decisions done and not take Jens, thwarted Heldt, in response to the caustic criticism on Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of weakness of style and that she had decided to change coach under the pressure of pubertaires fan said.
Lehmann had judged equally like a gesture of lack of sovereignty and of jalousiele made that his day of free after the matches he has been abolished.
The statements of Lehmann were" marked by a sheer selfishness" thrust Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
Did no longer risk to becoming friend for the life these two quadragénaires.
In cast whole, they were agreed for all the rest, this east to say only without the preliminary work group by the coach replaced, the strong and combative sporting representation would have not been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been" pro one big parts in the success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in choir– and even the man at the plastic bag agreed.

The matter Kunduz
Head-on attack of the opposition: The leader of the parliamentary groups of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Ministre of the defence Guttenberg of lie in the case of the matter Kunduz.
The parties SPD and the Gauche die( Linke) challenge at the chancellor.
Hamburg/ Berlin-- after exam of the last information on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has blamed the ministers of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg( CSU) have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Ministre has intentionally" formulated a contrevérité" on the deadly strike in last September, two tanker trailer has said the leader of the parliamentary groups of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the emission of news of the chaine ARD" Tagesschau"( the newspaper of numberModel).
Plainly, that means that he has lied.
The order to kill has been given the total contempt of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan( ISAF).
This, in substance, the content of the report whose NATO arranges and who has been read by Mr. Guttenberg, has said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe in effect consisted, no not at to destroy the trucks stolen, but well aimed to eliminate two leaders important Taliban.
According to the report of inquiry of NATO, 142 persons had been killed or hurt at the time of the American attack air who had been speeded at the demand for the colonel German Goerg Klein military, Commandant of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have prayed Saturday the chancellor Angela Merkel( CDU), to pronounce in the more brief deadlines in front of federal Parliament and to reveal this which Guttenberg knew really about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green party Renate Künast are advices that Mrs Angela Merkel must say clearly if the strategy of slaughter ciblé makes part of the Afghan policy the federal Gouvernement and if the chancellery, the army and the services of information have approved this new strategy.

The worlds of the dream
Some which show up, all awake, pictures and hear voices nobody else sees neither number' hears.
It is not only at the psychological sick persons, or under the effect of the drug, only the limits between the imagination and the reality mix up.
While these phenomena emerge during the sleep, everything is all right going.
When we recline long in our bedrooms darkened, we can indulge untrammelled in the at the dreams and at the fantasies the more mad.
However this of dream, the experience of statehood hears and shows up of the things the others do not perceive, quickly the reputation in our western world to be madman otherwise drugged an original.
Such picture and voice do not appear only at the psychological sick persons or under the effect of the drug.
This is our imagination who is in cause: This is the same neural activity who allows us to conceive of houses, to paint paintings or to write novels, but who sometimes encourages the limits between the dream, the madness and the reality to merge.
Of a dream, a state of aware awakening, taking the form can introduce under the forms the more various, at best one calls that sights, to the worst of the madness.
But even if the release mechanism and the effect stand out, aimed of the mystical Hildegard at von Bingen, the experiences of drug of the prophet of the new Age Carlos Castaneda, the chamanes trances of the, the psychoses and the hallucination am attributable at the very similar processes.
He has there hallucination or délires about when balance him, neurotransmettrices substances of the am brain-- first and foremost the dopamine, the noradrénaline, the sérotonine and the achétylcholine-- breaks and only the interaction between the various part of the brain am disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts very often emerge during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The strength of attraction land does no longer have power on the person.
Since the antique, philosopher and physician have always leaned on the relation between the madness and the dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations support a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, an of the founders of the modern psychiatry, noted in 1861" one big resemblances between the madness and dreams him", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even" a psychosis with all the irregularity, imagination, delirium and sensory illusion who make her up".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T is turning to character of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions at the loud colours.
The attraction land does no longer have power on him, he is gliding at the raz du ceiling.
He feels a blow.
, grimaçantes back him of the winged creatures of devil, the bloodstained mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, give peal of foot with heavy blazing boot, throw away against the wall, he feels pain in all the body.
Thundering voices, nasty, scream, going out walls and of the radio.
He can no longer support these voices who insult and the humiliate.
Henning uproots two cables of his chain stereo, in fact a loop and ties him to a set hook at the ceiling.
He is mounting on a baffle and is passing to the loop around.
He is jumping.
The loop unties.
That that serves you lesson, are shouting the voice in a choir to snatch from him the eardrum. "Is going into a clinic and make treat!"
Today Henning 40 years, he has experience six acute psychoses, the last dates 2 year, the première of soon 20 year.
She has been launched by the LSD.
The diagnosis: Psychosis schizo-affective, paranoïde, moreover he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married since three year.
During the psychosis I have lived terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
A percentage about of the population suffers at least a time in his life of schizophrenia; In the mental homes this is the illness the more frequent after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, no longer can to make the difference between the interior world and the external world, they meet in a state of hyper excitement, who make that they can suffer from hallucination, of megalomania, of relational madness otherwise of persecution.
Is very standard to hear voices– of the voices who order, who comment or who converse.
Not be in short supply no longer.
The concernée person can no longer make the distinction between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the signals troublemaker, the aware is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, the psychosis opens the locks a tide of idea and of fantasy born of the more deep coats of the awareness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is centred on the subject, according to the Professeur Thomas Fuchs, leader of the department of psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg( Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic finds in full centre of the situation, all at a meaning centred on him.
Simultaneously he meets in a passive role, he is like in a dream, surmounted by the events and he can not act on them of active way.
This is the reason for which the schizophrenics often feel endangered, contrôlés, handled.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, the illusions am one cruel realities, to wake up eastern outcast.
To make the experience one times in his life of an hallucination.
At the difference dream, according to Fuchs," the structure sensory and spatial of the reality who is perceived during the psychosis, fundamentally am maintained ".
The thoughts and the delirious hallucinations are based on the reality, the alienation of the experience takes place real in one frames.
Why does our brain make this kind caper, is always a riddle for the researcher.
Exceptional situations can bring anyone to lose momentarily the perception of the reality, according to Fuchs.
But lonely a small number of person will develop a psychosis.
He seems to have there a genetic proneness to the schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown the genes are not the lonely decisive factors.
The researchers suppose that the concernées persons present tiny brain damages.
One supposes that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at a precocious stage of the development for example by a viral infection of the mother during the pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But this who stays still unexplained, this is the way of the anomaly of the neural system happens and moreover makes that she does not demonstrate during numerous years.
The environmental factors also play a role– the stress or a traumatic experience can be a release mechanism of psychosis, if however he has there proneness.
Likewise the hallucinogenic drugs can launch psychoses for they act on the neurotransmetteurs.
When our brain warms up.
This who are mad, says to us the professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, this is that the psychotic suffer their hallucination and drugs costly in order to get rid of him while others buy drugs well dearly in order to provide with them.
The or unpleasant pleasant perception of the illusions is often exactly a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten gathers ever since ten years of the reports on the hallucinations and the phenomena of unrealistic picture: The past year he has published his results in a work entitled" the unreal world in our head".
The hallucinations well belong of the concomitant phenomena typical of the psychoses but also of an impressive number of good of other pathology.
One counts among them the psychological troubles like the borderline or the depression but also the headache, the epilepsy, the multiple sclerosis, the illness of Alzheimer or the cranial trauma.
Is surprising to note only in some conditions even eastern healthy person's brain subject to the hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragment of memory who normally are inhibited.
They take shape when of the brain who treat the sensory perceptions, the areas are hyperactive or not sufficiently curbed; When our brain but also warms up ago absence of stimulation.
The drugs can launch this state just like a brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, the stress, the sorrows of love or others exceptional mental states.
In the recent studies, recognizes that to have made at least a time in his life the experience of an hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah 16 years, she lives in a petite ville of Mecklembourg-Poméranie antérieure and she is going into the secondary school.
A girl all to make normal as a matter of fact.
If it was not the pictures and the voices.
During the recreation, it is managing only an young chestnut brown boy, mince, at the long hairs, he sends the word.
When she answers him his comrades look, nobody else surprised– shows up hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a dreamer moody but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure of him.
She is awakened, hears and sees this boy all as she sees and hears the girl who is sat next door of her on the bench.
She can even perceive his presence momentarily.
This is a pleasant sensation, she finds this young likeable.
I am mad?, asks her sometimes.
But she well knows that this young and the other sights are not real and that they are going to disappear again.
The night the appearances are, generally, frightening.
Often the sights are heavy.
When she is in class, it is happening that she can follow the course because the professor is true in the process of to present a new pupil in his eyes and his ears while he is invisible for the others and that the professor visibly am in the process of to explain equations to the painting.
The night the appearances are, generally, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his bedroom, she waits for the sleep who is too much arriving rarely and well too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awakened or dreams already, yes the pictures which she sees, the grimaçants visages or the girl with the bloody cuts on the arms the legs and find in front of his or closed open eyes.
Leave- moi moi quiet, she shouts at these creatures.
She does not talk about him to neither at his parents neither at his friends, they would choose it as a lunatic.
Autumn 2009. Sarah has today 20 years.
She has had his ferry last year and she lives with sound friend.
An year ago the hallucinations have stopped.
Since she has entered in contact by internet with the psychologist Kasten she all right knows that she is not mad.
The madness is also a work of art of the despair.
Or number'what when someone is socially insulated has not sufficiently of stimulation, the probability is big he does have hallucinations at the end of a certain time.
I suppose that fact is taking him out it is the animation.
Sarah K. unique, girl, had fear of the other children when she was small and often played all lonely.
His hallucinations started when she taught 13 year, than the man she called pop, since she was en âge de to think, was not his true father.
This are the same cerebral areas who are active for the and acoustic visual hallucinations, and for the impression and real noise, he is therefore very difficult for the persons like Sarah K of faire the difference be entering the illusion and the reality. "Each experience", according to" Kasten takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also pictures who form in the brain, therefore they seem so real. "
For Kasten, the nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Healthy person's hallucinations do not stand out fundamentally from this in acute psychosis.
Conversely of the schizophrenics, am capable to recognizing that the fantasies are not real pictures.
Therefore Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations like a particular talent.
He has there only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too centred on the awareness one unfortunately has quickly tendency to choose the imaginary experiences as pathology, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and physician leader of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence Nightingale at Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe disease, painful who but also contains something of positive, creator-- the madness is a work of art of the despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience said oniroïde, a particular form of the modification of the awake awareness by the dream.
The oniroïdes experiences are very complex dreams who are perceived like real by this what who lives them and he can differentiate from the same dream when he is in state of awakening.
The state of oniroïde awareness emerges during a trauma or in the situations of extreme pathology like for the patients suffering from polyradiculopathie who fully aware, make the experience a paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when an human being is threatened and of the world by a loss of himself, owed to an and lasting total incapacity to move, he replaces this real situation who reports suffering at his life, by his own imaginary dream world who is disassociated from the reality.
This is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As is not possible to surmount the situation in the reality, one changes of world takes place but the représentée eastern real situation in the imagination.
He is in fact a matter, of an intense form of mean and of interpretation, in an intolerable situation in and of itself, one abilities of organization who is given by we, at us the men, in order to not sink in the nothingness of the loss of awareness.
All is real even later on in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, historian of art described as his oniroïdes experiences in his book" change of heart" like action of safeguard of the soul.
He 49 years, when aware sound is leaving for a journey of several days after the operation from a steady cardiac valve of a transplant; In the meantime, his body is doomed to stay motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen is plunging into a world which he has created of all piece, visit of the foreign place, journey in the time. He shows up in old man alité in a sanatorium railway, a robot at his bedside watching on his health.
He saw at the moyen âge among the nobles who make narcotics based blood.
He is taken away from motorbike is taking him away in his country, he surfs with his bed of hospital in the névé of the Alps and who a Korean mafieux by a Greek.
He completely absorbs in this dream world, all is real even later on in his memories.
According to Claussen these interior journeys fundamentally stand out from all dream.
The dream is a quite various state, he writes while describing this which he has lived.
On the contrary of the dreams, the recollections coming of the mental journeys are a extreme lights and very detailed even years later on.
One can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience make explode the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Eventually, the oniroïdes delirium, the psychoses, the hallucinations and experience psychedelic show us how much our interior representations of the external reality are fragile even in statehood of eve.
Of the state of awareness, all change amounts "the psychologist Kasten can provoke a distortion of this we call the reality."
An experience can be as quite who enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years, the children will take the continuation of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen at the post of CEO of the publishing Burda is an intermediate solution: At more than long term, Hubert Burda wishes that his two children take back the press groups, has said to the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must have left at 100% a family business.
Hamburg -- A long terme, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his society between the hands of his children
Will be the two children will inherit at 27 years and are firmly determined to integrate the society, has said Hubert Burda, 69 years, to the Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question to know if they will be active in the enterprise will arise afterwards.
He will necessary to see also if they are capable of him.
One can not impose his children on 7500 collaborators without to know if they have the ability to handle him.
That would demolish the children as well as the enterprise.
Burda had known last Thursday and which it withdrew post president- general from the month of January his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is member of the council of Administration since 1999.
He was foremost responsible for the technological sector.
Afterwards he handled the sector Trésor to say that he was responsible for the capital of the enterprise and after the start of Jürgen Todenhöfer he took also the head of the marketing, foreign sector, of the impression and finance.
So for first time this is not a member of family who is at the head of the the publishing Burda.
The children of Burda respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who today 42 year, east died some year ago.
The nommination of Kallen equally serves to make the linkage the 10 or 15 next years"
Burda specifies that the holding company must have left at 100% between the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have left entrainer by a compulsive eating of capital, who have made enormous speculation unfortunate while thinking that would cannot to climb always more than high.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had rêvede universal power, has said Burda.
I do absolutely not show up in the role of private tutor of the country as can the being Springer and I do not plan of faire gone of these international leagues like the Time, these enterprises have taken much too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely restricted, he is a matter of a device who only allows that to look at his email, without to offer the possibility would be that to see certain type of enclosed piece or to sail on the Internet.
He benefited his five minute of glory the United States, when the magazine Time designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the idea seems interesting, above all for the young.
Contrary to the the Smartphones, Peek offers a very weak price and one monthly subscriptions, either less the half of this which cost, per example, the subscription dated the iPhone.
Considering his success, the enterprise has thrown two new devices: One conceived exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service of data at life, pro six faith more dear than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the time of the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and his third incarnation.
He is all as limited than his American grand-frère, but comprise a surprise.
The price of his monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming in all Europe.
This who are travelling with a smartphone know already this which the fact that to give up the data when one crosses a border or to fish desperately a cafeteria on the Wifi( or a connection of Fon) in order to cannot to consult his mail imagines.
A roaming at a fixed price's idea is incredibly attractive and that makes a long time that she would have to function.
Indeed, certain operator have at disposal of special agreement and of option am travelling, but in this who concern, I would need to have made a thesis in physical appearance in order to consist of and good telescopes in order to read the small characters.
The repeated calls to order of the European Commission in order to propose affordable rates of roaming in all Europe had an effect hardly perceptible.
Outside his country of origin, am nervous to using the data, and one not blame.
Only a small device like the FonPeek (he is always curious that he calls Fon while he does not arrange Wifi) offers this type of rate, means that are beginning to thinking differently and study various proposal allowing them to make profitable their network of data.
Kindle is a good other example, he understands the downloading of book and of other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without galley.
He is a matter of a device connected and one pays at the time of his purchase and not for each month.
And this is this I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: A call option with access to life like Peek proposes him already in the United States.
No which I wants to buy.
I look at my mail on my telephone, thank you.
I simply wish for him because I believe that this is a more true formula for the consumer.
Would be interesting to see a computer presenting this same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
The yellow is, arguably, the first lady of the United States's favourite colour.
If she has gone to the hold of function of Barack Obama at the presidency of the United States with a dress and one coats of this colour, she has, indeed, chosen la même in order to accompany her in the second instant, undoubtedly, the more important of his life: The reduction in Oslo of the price Nobel of the Paix.
Michelle Obama reported a model very similar in these two opportunities: Besides their lifelike colour, an yellow getting away towards the green with the reflection brilliant, the two time, the dress consisted of three piece: The dress, the jacket and the coat, in le même fabric, and was embellished with of a big embroidery or of a collar.
So that of a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States is following the Princesse of the's wake Asturies and has chosen to put back the same dresses.
But the fabric are cut the two sets makes very various.
If for the hold of function he was a matter of a thick lace, on the other hand, she carried in Oslo a printed velvet.
Also the accessories are various: Of the green shoes at medium heel for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but gilded, this time- ci.
Also the hairstyle she has changed: The hairs are now banked while she reported them broken the previous time.
75% mothers who work of the professional problems because of their motherhood
The discrimination at the work has increased during these last years, above all for the wives of the young generations who who want to be mother.
This is this the study reveals" fertility and professional career of the women in Spain", achieved by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto of the Mujer.
The inquiry, achieved on 9737 wives of 15 at 75 years, does not leave to place at the doubt: 75% mothers who work have seen their professional career limited at cause of the motherhood.
The study indicates that it exists numerous differences concerning the beginning of the life in couple and child's number, if the woman or nay works and type of busy employment.
Of the home, this who not have of activity in outside part-time work or have a little stable work, start early couple, have their first pregnancy early and have more of child.
On the other hand, the women one stable employment, mainly in the public sector, reject the entry in the life in couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer of child.
The women between 35 and 49 years one fixed works have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after to have settled in couple. This figure is passing at 4.1 at this who work in the public sector. "These data show that the women one stable employment have had need in addition for time in their life in order to get him, this who has brought them to reject the union and the arrival of the children.
Of more than, the type of trained employment widely influences the motherhood, but less the date of beginning of common life ", explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is an other factor who dig up the distance of the age of the marriage of the women and their first child.
According to the inquiry, more the level of formation is brought up, more they get married and has their first child late.
The difference also keeps up among the wives of a same generation.
Per example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, this who have fact and superior elementary studies have respectively been mother for first time at 25.1 and at 32.1 years on average.
"An other disctinction also appears between the women, according to their level of study.
While this who made elementary studies get married and have their first child before to find a stable employment, this having made studies or superior medium level reverse this program and give the priority at the procurement of a stable work like prerequisite at the marriage and at a child's arrival", clarify madam Delgado.
Diane Kruger also well worth he
The Oréal has just to add a new name to his list be jealous of ambassadress: Diane Kruger.
From the year next, the German actress will embody the picture of several products of the mark, intoning the universal currency "because I worth bien".

At the men, the mark of cosmetic counts as ambassadors high-class: Patrick Dempsey( Dre Grey, lesson of anatomy) and Matthew Fox( the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
The prices of the British fashion

The poker of ace of Manuel Vincent
Manual Vincent offers to us in Poquer of ases( Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) one trentaine" radiography" of writer who have crossed his literary life( and sometimes, his other life).
He does not make him according to the foreseeable kinds and apprehended biographical( summary, life and work), but while looking for something of similar to the stone of ignition of the character created.
The journey is exciting and Vincent saves neither the frights neither the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation at the readings and relectures.
I leave to you here some snapshots.

A slack aggression
Last week, my mother, who environ 70 years, was strolling in our area of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young between 15 and 18 years was passing next door of her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved of the SPA and weighing no more than of six kilos, and without to say word, they struck into him two peals of foot who left the seriously injured dog.
Our indignation is huge for we do not see this of amusing to attack free one defenceless animal boys exaggerates him, was in leash. only ago
He necessary to add to that a lady who who was quietly strolling's indignation and, when did she abuse what these individuals, managed to fear for his physical integrity, since am capable to doing the same thing to a woman, a child, one old men or, eventually, all person more weak than him.
The episode took place towards 17 hours, a Tuesday like an other, in an area usually quiet.
The dog has groaned the whole day.
We have of course dropped plaint at the commissionership of the area even if we doubt that that is useful for much and in order to not touch the sensitivities, we want exactly to specify that the assassins cowards were Spanish.
The indignation has brought us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand this who happens at the young so that they find amusing to ill-treat free a defenceless animal who give us the affection, the friendship and holds company.
We do not know where has passed the good education and the respect animals and persons.
Michelin and Fesvial, set for the harbour of the helmet
Making him of tyre Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Fondation for the Sécurité road (Fesvial), thrown a country in order the harbour of the helmet, mainly at the motorcyclist the more young, as the two structures have indicated him today.
This initiative has for objective to take awareness of the importance harbour of the helmet, since he was a matter of the lonely element of protection affording to save the injuries the head, or even the death, in the event of accident in two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that this country registered in the tradition of his commitment for the road safety, who" are going beyond the conception and the manufacture of always more sure product" and has claimed that she contributed to this objective by others actions at and informative pedagogical character.
This new country of encouragement of the harbour of the helmet in two wheels, under the currency" To be yet to not be ", will comprise a first phase bills will be distributed in more than of 500 garages of motorcycle, in order to guarantee the more wide diffusion.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that the road safety" is a constant worry "for the enterprise, for as manufacturer of pneumatiques for the vehicles at two wheels, one of his objective principals is that to develop always more sure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicle progresses
After almost two years, am beginning to seeing a few of light at the end of the the tunnels.
The 9425 registered vehicles in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% with respect to 2008 and, this who are more important, they imagine the first increase after 22 consecutive months of reduction, according to the figures of the patronal trade union of the manufacturers Anfac and of Ganvam, this of the concessionaire.
However advisable to qualify the good news him, since the reference serving the comparison, the month November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a reduction of 60% with respect to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the development of the month last, the registrations accumulated at the time of these 11 month place 40% below this of the previous exercise.
Since January, if one all adds the vehicles who are entering the category of the light commercial vehicles( cars of tourism, pick-up, van light, coach and truck at light frame diverted) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds who affect the more their request have not for all that dispersed. Indeed, although they are also bought by the persons, most of the purchases are achieved by medium small or enterprises, who pay in almost 100% cases grace to an external financing.
Thus, in addition to the the restriction involved by the limitation of the funds banking, he necessary to add others factors like the increase of the unemployment rate or the economical persistence of the bad situation.
Against this situation and in contrast to the the vehicles of tourism, the helps at the purchase of the 2000 E have little served.
Besides the persons, the independents and the SME who who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of fewer of 3.5 tonnes with a level of emission of Co2 who not outpaces the 160 grams at the kilometer, can benefit from him, but the number of operation talks about himself. as
Yesterday, at Ganvam, one again remembered the necessity for the administration to tie a close attention at these vehicles and also to the industrial vehicles( truck and bus).
The association of the concessionaires foresees an year 2010 similar at this who draws to the close, does she calculate a fall of the (vehicles of tourism and 4 x4) 19%.
The help at the braking of urgency is now compulsory
As that has taken place with the antilock system of the brakes ABS and as that will take place with the test of stability ESP, the systems helps at the braking of urgency will constitute a compulsory element on the European cars.
They are besides already compulsory on the cars of tourism and the recently registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles one periods deficiency has been determined until end February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, has for objective to reinforce the protection pedestrians, even yes, in his mode of action, can as help to avoiding numerous shocks back.
The assistant at the braking of urgency acts while increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of detected by the system thanks to the the kicks given by the driver.
But the latter does not maintain always the pressure until the end.
According to an headed study by the manufacturer of component for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident number' not cannot to lean on the brake before the crash, and the half of them number' not pulled profit all his strength.
Until 1100 accidents
The intervention of the help, in revancha, requires the maximum from the system of brake, reducing the distance of the car to need to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all the cars were equipped of this type of element, until 1100 mortal accidents in which pedestrians are involved would cannot to be avoided each year.
This reduction would be still more important with the popularisation of the clever system of braking of urgency said: One calculates that a disaster on four with the casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped of a system at a radar or at one cameras, grace detects the obstacles and warns the driver, on top of that to act slightly on the brakes
If the driver reacts, he helps him while increasing the pressure on the pedal, if that is necessary.
If he does not react, and well only the crash either inévitable, the device exercises the maximal effort in the brakes in order to minimize the harm.
General Motors grows again until in January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the factory Opel of Figueruelas( Saragosse) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors( GM) Europe, would the production of the new Meriva be lancée during the first week of April– likely the 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that he will have need for more of time in order to conclude the plan of help of Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, hears that each point of the flat has been approved beforehand by the concernée part.
And that can imply that the final document, who will be first subjected to the at the workers puis at the governments of the countries the factories find where, is postponed until beginning 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, one affirms that a decision on the sale of Saab would have to be made in the next days.
He is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened up the pressure on the American manufacturer in order he makes a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with new possible buyers.
Would cannot to be Geely, who does who also aspire to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of car of casual Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, attacks of the importance.
In the case he have there agreed with none of them, would cannot to sell a part of Saab to the enterprise Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if she is not sold is maintained.
At the steering wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to conceive their last and precious jewel, the engineers of Porsche have left of the Boxster and has succeeded to thinning him of nothing only less only 80 kilos, this who leave the scale to only 1275 kilo.
That has brought them to dispense, first and foremost, with the automatic roof who has been substituted by a manual roof covered over, affording to reduce 21 kilo, to employ doors in aluminium like this of the GT3, 15 other kilos of fewer, to taking away the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, from to mount bacquets of sport, still 12 kilos, and with the light tyres of 19 thumb, five kilos.
Finally, they have given up the systems audio CDR-30, thus earning six other kilogrammes and have substituted the poignéesdes doors for the handfuls in fabric, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the box PDK at double clutch, the test has been achieved on a model at manual box of six speeds, mainly on the road of the secondary network of California, in mountain, with the particularly winding turn.
His behaviour can be described as irreproachable.
The reduction of the weight does not prevent the car to rolling on the ground with composure.
On the contrary: That made a long time that we had not tested an and light as small model who, in same weather, guaranteed autant of security in the turns, included at big speed.
This is a small athlete capable to overheating his small musclesà speed during the necessary time, until we ask it to sprint, to slow down, to recover and to push into news his engine
This is all this which we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as communicative than precise, the car will make this which our hands on the steering wheel will indicate.
And she will do him with a surgical precision.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of his V6 to box, with 320 horses( 10 of more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and to box, with 320 horses( 10 of more than the Boxster S) can be reinforced with the option" casual" or grace at a system who change the roar of the motor, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of brutal eastern acceleration, only this either at the stop otherwise at the time of recovery.
The suspension are firm, but not hard neither uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads which we have covered with the Boyxster Spyder was enough damaged, but the car has well managed the potholes.
The electronic assistants hardly made action of presence on all the ride, then only on certain turn we have found of the ice at the small morning and gravel, later on in the morning.
.
The car will be put in the sale in February 2010, at a price of 70831 euros.

Thank you very much
Where afterwards pink days since the last spring, at the course the inflation of the assets has constituted the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty was again springing, this who are not surprising since he is a matter of their state, up in a middle the agents attack from the decisions on an uncertain future per nature.
The employé cure by the central banks in order to stabilize the markets has been that to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of asset and indirectly while giving plentiful liquidity at the close rates from scratch, in order the financial institution buy asset to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of asset have been practically finalized and, without to put their non-conformiste policy of liquidity back in cause, are beginning to putting a few of sand in the cogwheels, as the BCE has made him, with their tender at an year of next week.
Therefore, the investors doubt the ability of the world-wide economy to keep a revival economical without hétérodoxes measure and we are in the process of to attend a conversely of the reduction of the premiums of risk.
The volatility of the grants and the distances of the obligations of the enterprises again increase, although they stay very distant from the paranormal levels which they have reached at the beginning of the year.
Has been has seen bound to socialize the private risk and the public debt is again affected.
News one take-offs towards the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany ago have been the selected refuges by the investors, provocative an increase of the differences between the countries of the area euro and Germany.
Spain has been hardly touched by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's has threatened of a new revision at the decline in the qualification Kingdom of Spain.
Of an other side, one few of uncertainty not am bad in order to shut up the defenders of the moral risk, who tried again of to provoke a moral dilemma at lesresponsables in order the world-wide economical policy who slowed down the destructive effects diverted of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of the employment, then that this which he would necessary to make this am to order a new day Action of grace.
However, the situation of Dubaï looks like a tribal struggle between the emirs in order to give his place back to the power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government a public deficit, elections, conceals and a new government who discover the pot aux roses.
Prodi did him in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates to the Portugal after Durão Barroso.
He would be perfectly irrational that the Ecofin saves Hungary from a not respect of his payments external at the beginning of the year and at a member country of the area euro to not honour his commitments.
This on the other hand who are logical, this is that the Ecofin has incited the Greek government to the transparency and his coresponsables citizens of the necessity of measure extraordinary in order to maintain the stability of his public finances.
If, as we hope for him, we find against an episode of normalization of the premiums of transitory risk, after some redundances in the positions high, that would be foreseeable.
In the Spanish case, while our distances of the public debt increase worthy of the the obligation of European enterprise, we have step to worry us.
If the European distances diminished and that continued to increasing, he would be a matter then of a Spanish idiosyncrasique risk.
The matter Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our projected indicators require most of the services of study to anticipate their models of revival and to review at the rise their forecasts for 2011, who with moreover the OCDE and the European Commission, are going back on the load with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, she does not augur many of hope in order at their warning.
Of news, that looks to constitute an excellent opportunity to buying Spanish assets

On the other hand, the Barça has pocketed 2.5 million in order to have won the European Super Cup in August.
But in more than, he has there the variable payments, whom 337.8 million are established.
This money is distributed according to the proportional worth of each market televised.
The Spanish market is one of the more important, and refreshed of four accredited places.
The champion of the previous year pockets 40% of the affected money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the quatrième.
