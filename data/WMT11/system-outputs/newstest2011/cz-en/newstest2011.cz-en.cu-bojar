What are you going to do? the Social Democrats (ČSSD) in Prague does not know Voldemort or patisserie
New councilors in the capital city of the Social Democrats (ČSSD) will have to overcome a language barrier to in Prague's Council, and at once the understanding of their colleagues from the ODS.
Daily Aktuálně. Cz new members of the Council of the Social Democrats (ČSSD) of the ``tested" , how they know the notorious introduced slang, who at City Hall was over the past few years, when Prague ruled the coalition partners.
A coded dictionary, which, Prague's political elites introduced during the previous era Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters and situations kauz in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councilors known concepts too does not understand.
At least that's what he says.
``Who's Voldemort?"
``I do not know."
``I am in Prague's politics more of a rookie," responded to the test of ``kmotrovského" of the vocabulary Councillor for the culture of Lukáš Kaucky.
And as the political veteran, reacted similarly, Councillor Karel Brezina.
To the concept of ``golf hole" .
``It's the only an expression of those, what i suggest, which sometimes use."
````Otherwise slang in general, i."
From the vocabulary, whose expressions of daily Aktuálně. Cz published this year in June before the Congress of the ODS, chose redakce six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Town hall.
The Socialists have to explain the concepts of ``Voldemort" , ``the biggest golf hole in Prague," ``go into the ice," ``bull throat," ``betrayal of the capital city," and ``oplechovat."
The three of the aldermen with a pop quiz agreed, the fourth - Weinert, which is in the future be pražskému education - first interview promised, later, but did not answer the phone.
The fifth Councillor Petr Dolínek straight test refused.
``These things do not care and how to enjoy the Civic Democrats, i will evaluate."
``I do, how we understand each other in the framework of our programmes," responded.
As already mentioned, Councilman Lukáš Kaucky would in the title of the supposedly recognize that you are talking about the influential entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora Bém Romano Janouškovi.
````Voldemort" Kauckému him, says nothing and the deadline, which in the test correctly guessed, is ``the biggest golf hole in Prague."
``It's the tunnel," says Kaucky, and says: ````but i know more from the newspaper."
``I will have to pay a language course," the joke.
Golf swing then as Blanka tunnel administration decrypts not only the matador Karel Brezina, but also Councillor Environment Lukáš Shy.
Both of the Social Democrats then they know who actually Voldemort, and Luke Plachému is familiar, where this figure find - a sense of the importance of the expression ``go to the candy store."
``I think it means go to some of the Prague's company," he' s shy near the solution, that's head office Janouškových firms.
The same with Březinou recalls that knowledge derived from the newspapers, rather than to such a dictionary.
In the social democracy under 12 trainees test no such familiar vocabulary slangových expressions does not exist.
``I have even with his colleagues, but it looks like that really we do not have anything like that."
``We are rather names, sometimes used abbreviations and distortions of names," says the Chairman of the Prague Petr Hulínský, which partisans dubbed Hulda.
``In school told me Elm, but i do not know if you call me that even colleagues," says the nickname Karel Brezina.
Daily Aktuálně. Cz name tried and works.
Councillor Weinert is for straníky grandfather or less friendly, assembly Miroslav Poche, which before the elections said fraud while sponsoring side, has for some of his colleagues the nickname ``Igráček" .
Nicknames are also the only, what the Social Democrats in the internal revictualled concede.
Hulínský supposedly prophetess hear love, but the daily Aktuálně. Cz and noted another this the Prague's chairman.
``The doctor obuškového rights" he recalls that Petr Hulínský received its title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.

The rent is, after a moment comes to ask the older married couple, ``in the waiting room, but the new LETTING apparently not concern.

Half a discount on February rent, they also other tenants who new sign the Treaty until 15 December.
````Havířovská deregulatory" bulkhead but queries certainly congested is not.
``From yesterday's 360 clients here because of the hire in 2011 was only about forty or fifty people," the estimated worker behind the desk.
RPG on the Web and their nástěnkách proposes to individual negotiation of contracts, where it will be needed.

As a matter of priority is to get people who have signed an agreement on the increase in the rent.

The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. look into the interior from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of ancient lizard, the staircase reminds the backbone of Dinosaur and balconies are open fish mouth.
That's house Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the catalonian architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house, thanks to its organic shapes called the house of bones.
Organic forms, wild colors, an unusual use of stone, fragments of kachlů and mosaic, reminiscent of scales and pervasive soft curves, all of this is typical for secession Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house making a dreamlike line, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of the nature and animals.
During the detailed observations is seen geometričnost, rhythm and exactly a coherent procedure.
In the night of the facade home sounds more dramatically, is nasvícená so that was the impression of colors yet potentiated by.
The windings and twisting shapes in the same way also appear in the interiors.
The wood in waves copying the window frames, rail, decorative elements of the door, and bar.
The house Batlló, which is in the area of Eixample to purchase a busy street Passeig de Grácia No 43, rearranging the house from 1877 from the architect of Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction in two years, and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on cutting the old buildings and the construction of a completely new, but it soon Gaudí accepted the idea of the unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Apartment house Casa Batlló but Antoni Gaudí proposing alone.
He cooperated with him architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On his projektantském plank arose decoration for Retail apartment, the owner of the property and use of mosaic on the facade.
On the facade worked in many other writers and artists.
Common work on the basis of proposals house Casa Batlló was triggered by the successful cooperation Jujola with Gaudím.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí house Casa nice and park Güell, in which they are more Gaudí works.
From the local house, soon after the completion of the earned thanks to its organic shapes the nickname ``house of bones."
Others are due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call ``zívajícím house."
It is also said that at the top of the building's vypodobněn sword St George, the patron of Catalonia.
Religious hidden motives contain even more sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house proposed to its time unique system of central heating with odvětrávacími vents and typical of chimneys.
A bizarre may seem their forty - five - degree slope.
In the formation of the Gaudí absolutely ignored the building codes and leave them tie.
At the beginning of the construction has gained from the town of a building permit, but it referred to the data on the planned reconstruction were vague enough that, for two years later in the completion of the city council was the result of horrified and sought to remedy.
Councillor mind, for example, that construction intervened pillar, even in the public the sidewalk.
To remedy has never been, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the invitation urban areas, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully gained) authorisation to lease of two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower levels.
In the gallery on the second floor was the and on the third floor bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented.
The whole šestipatrový house intersects the staircase, which could be climbed up on the roof terrace.
The essential elements of perestroika was the abolition of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with modern concept interconnection of space.
Social part can be opening the door orchestr completely link and greater, the company can easily communicate, without at the same time, to the privacy of the necessary for a more intimate talks.
The house with Gaudí conversion, in addition to the new facade also non - traditional roofs and two floors.
Impressive is also Gaudí game with the light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is in the inner courtyard, and skylights.
The game two colors, he adds a maximum of light in all floors of the house.
It was simply bet on the principle that white reflects the light of more than the dark, which the sun's rays, on the contrary.
The house of the Casa Batlló, who was in 2005 included in the UNESCO World Heritage, may each visit.
In the first floor of the house is the largest and grandest apartment made available to the public.
The owners are for this step decided to in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of a hundred the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous artist.
For inspections remained, because they found that it's a very advantageous firm and, moreover, the spread of common and the attic areas, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monuments certainly is not negligible, 16,50 EUR and, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist průkazek have a 20% discount.
Sum considerably exceeds the price of admission to the other Gaudí buildings in the town.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with the dragon steeples, you must be fast friends with some of the building and to visit him directly at home.
How to choose the mattress and grid: women have requirements other than men
Not a the bed frame, but the quality of lehací area, i. e., a mattress, and the grate, give the basis for a really good bed.
It must, of course, harmoniously complement to meet the specific user.
In the selection of there's a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health, gender owner.
The important thing is also the type of the interior, in which the mattress and grate buying.
A typical example?
On the weekend cottage, where are regularly heated, are not suitable latex mattresses, because they are more slowly, ``warm."
Moreover, they tend to have a significantly higher than the standard PUR mattress.
Is necessary is regularly.
If they do not have a lot of the dump channels in the core, and is still lies on board, holds humidity: could be under them appear even mold.
In the selection shall also habit.
Who spent time abroad, where are often used a lot of the mattresses with změkčující layer, it's hard to feel good at a low, and with a hard surface.
``All the players who were returning from the NHL, to me, that's sleep."
``On my battered shoulders, and the sides needed mattresses with změkčující layer of lazy foam."
``Such is recommended even for people with diabetes, who have the failure of the nervous system, so badly transpose, information 'from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, upholstered furniture.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers, therefore, years ago mattress with lazy foam for.
``It's okay, a proper mattress has to Tempur, italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You do not need to be a man of the NHL to appreciate the lazy foam.
The ``miracle" works simply.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape according to absorbed warmth, or to adapt to your warm body.
Nothing you pushing, in the night you tumble as a struggle.
It's just better sleep.
Lazy foam works as a protection against proleženinami.
In the selection of the size of the mattress to its height, add more length of the foot, which is probably 21 to 34 cm.
A man or a woman with height around 180 cm so they need a bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be made for dvoulůžka 90 cm, together, therefore, 180 cm.
In the case of a single beds, for example, in the case of singlistů, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For the comfort of the possible visit.
````Otherwise's rule for beds simple: when lying on his back there should be hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, cechmistryně Guild čalouníků and decorators, which are the subject of a healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture for a number of years, and he teaches at her professional schools.
In the case of dvoulůžka needs to each of its own grate and the mattress, here, however, watch out for the purchase of the to reconcile the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will not be anything other than the gratings fitted into the various heights, you, however, for each a bed frame.
Foam mattress should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with the spring of the skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on shaping and hoeing layer.
``At the touch of her hands or landing on a mattress certainly do not feel springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each of the mattress requires a type of the grate.
Celočalouněná beds, when the mattress and background are like together with the Siamese twins, they are in the bedrooms what to do.
Mattresses wrong větrají, you can not wash their skin, which has already today is normal.
And because for the night normally vypotíme 0,2 - 0,75 L sweat, it is clear that so after five to seven years of the mattress begins to remind one big (and jammed) the sieve.
As a result of experts refuse to advertising slogans about the life of the mattresses up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantees.
Everything has, however, their but.
And, therefore, the Council of practice from sellers: for the mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm Hygiene and work detachable coating give up, but add rather mattress pad, which can easily be removed and wash.
Even if today are normally produce mattress covers with zdrhovadly around the circumference, so after the opening get two parts (for laundering and the size of the washing machine very important!), yet he could manipulation with larger types (and in one person) to shoot remind the light weight in the ring with a heavy.
You are in bed instead of the grate solid record?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for a visit to the one night.
The board, however, please (if it is already have) ventilation apertures and use the mattress with the spring of the skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from him. Taschenfederkern) and hoeing layer.
The PUR mattress on this basis.
To nepolohovací laminated gratings with 14 to 18 vanes will be appropriate latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut), but will always pays the gratings with a larger number of lamellae, 28 even more, where are lamels in the area of the shoulders bitterness, and it is possible to their stiffness regulate.
For pointing laminated gratings does not belong to the mattress with spring, because to point to respond.
In addition to the setting of lamellae to give the so - called the cradle.
It is a special footpad lamellae, which allows you to push, or even lean lamelu so as to shoulder the sleepers, ``he burrowed" .
For the men who have the ``shoulders across the back" , certainly important thing.
Even at her memories of the producers mattresses, who in the ``men's" began to use změkčující zone in the area of the shoulders.
For women also remember - those again afforded softer surface in places of hip.
For the most discerning customers are intended křidélkové or the platelet gratings with the so - called multitorzním '.
The pressure decomposes into more points and reduces tension.
Of course, as soon as you apply to the mattress and grate bad pillow (big and ``plump"), most of the ``plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow to buttress his head and intervene only to my shoulders, in order to release the shoulder muscles.
As the appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer to, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side of the should pillow terms (together with the cradle of the grate or změkčenou zone in the mattress), the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses with the original mattresses plněnými into something in common.
Their producers, are increasingly using natural materials, or at least the matter.
The trend is even for the mattress bio.
The raw materials from oil, of which are produced polyurethane foam, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from skočce and soybean.
Just soybeans use all known producers.
````Bio with mattresses, it means that the core is made of a material purely of natural origin," says Petr Vašíček from the firm Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of the mattress ticking, one of the first was aloe vera.
But have you can even mikrokapsle to greaten fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also the distribution of for men and women.
While the men of the ``cool" plant extract from the birch, to cover the mattress absorbed the heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, seat covers - ````awash."
The extract from the red chilli increases blood circulation, so it is weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorite?
Mattress made of cold foam (more pores with unbroken cellular structure is so prodyšnější than the current polyurethane and offers a better elasticitu.
A combination of different tuhostí cold foam and ``lazy foam" arise vícezónové mattresses, which they know exactly where it is supposed to be the head, shoulders and his heels.
For high - quality of the mattress pay so from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters, they tend to have a lower rate of VAT, are treated as health aids.
As the first reached in the Czech Republic for this advantage Gumotex.
Economize on the mattress and grid is not easy.
Sometimes can be used to actions producers or vendors, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
To mark Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with sewn storage foam Memory to cover for 11 990 CZK.
Second, however, we can have a free of charge.
The era of lazy or of viscoelastic foams, with an open the cell structure and high density of the ``cosmic" pace material Tempur.
It was originally as material for NASA, because when starts were astronauts exposed to an enormous congestion.
Tempur in the warm softening, in the cold, on the other hand, reinforces.
Warm the human body is so perfectly adapted and lay in his pressure.
It is therefore an ideal against the emergence of advantages include wider, but also to increase the comfort in my sleep.
Viscoelastic foams used not only on the mattresses, but also of health products, to the special pillows under his feet, which relieve the feet and žilnímu system.
Domestic producers, for example, use of foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver, and the like.
Instruments for the monitoring of people want to increasingly parents, so they want to deal with their children
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of a sitter across the GPS.
The system was originally created for the search for cars may have to follow the movement of people, thereby helping to in such cases, which is the disappearance of the nine - year - old Annie Janatkové.
The device is not about the size of a box of matches, soon, but it may be a large just like clockwork.
Many people scared case missing Annie and began to the quest for resources, as their children better protect.
Even for the price of their privacy.
``We are all say that there's no spying, but on the next to reduce the likelihood that' s a tragedy," says Petr sawdust of society, Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the czech market.
``I admit that, in a particular case, may result in abuse of such equipment, when you are in a bag, someone who does not know about it, but we are with such a case."
``Most of it actually customers are buying for security reasons," he added sawdust.
According to him, would always child should know, for what purpose of the ``a" is used, and how to use in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that, if the child will not want anything like to wear, i am just to get rid of.
``Even very small children show great creativity in how some things on purpose to lose, if they do not want to be under control."
``The great expectations raised previously in my parents' cell phones, which is, however, will turn off as well as the tracking device," says Bočková.
According to her is also debatable whether, in the case of assault, indeed, such a device would help.
``As regards the forthcoming kidnapping, it will ensure the perpetrator virtually always to each child had no electronics, which could not reveal his position."
``It is now the phone."
``When you start to expand the tracking device, they will be looking for them, because of their sales must be supported by a massive advertisement."
``In this case, the criminals always one step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
Admits, however, that a similar device may help in the case of a sudden assault.
According to the Robert Čech from the company RC monitoring, which offers a surveillance services for cars, so for persons, even in the event occurs after the attack immediately to the destruction of the surveillance equipment, may his presence of assistance.
``The device can be set on a regular sending position after a certain period of time."
``If the damage was done, will be available for at least the last position of the person concerned."
``The more expensive device have built - in and náklonometry, so that even if you just slipped and lay motionless, send apparatus immediately warning with its position," says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service may take even smart mobile phones with navigation, where's record and special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units lies in the fact that, either on the apparatus similar přívěskům size matchbooks or smaller mobile phones.
Always so threatens to their loss.
In accordance with the sawdust from Macro Weil, therefore, now testing device - looking like a normal digital watches.
``It will be the biggest advantage in that, if any, the Aggressor need surveillance equipment did not know."
``Or are known to after some time and it may have the police extra time," he adds.
Whatever the tracking device developed into bracelets or pendants, they will still be using the same technology, which is used for the baby - sitter.
It's a combination of positioning through the GPS system (who use the normal autonavigace) and functions of mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle.

The General Staff in the rationale for the purchase of so much of the quantity of ignitable lines MF Dnes, that the soldiers in the training to consume 60 miles detonating a year.
From the calculations of military bomb, which MF Dnes said, however, shows that, then it would be very intense Pyrotechnic training to each year browse through all the generals, officers of the command of an army, executive secretaries or cleaners.
Secretary of Defense Alexander Vondru and commander of the army vlastimila Picka including.
Only then could be justified annual consumption of the army sixty miles detonating.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it were, stocks of the army would be enough to maintain for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, to the basic training each new professional is enough for more than two meters detonating cord, as they say the experts, so the army fresh purchase ensure - even with increased consumption Engineers or special units - stocks on the 225 years.
The soldiers Brigade of the Rapid Reaction Force, Minister Vondrovi recently personally complained that are almost no bullets into small arms, so, too, are shooting because of the need for money limited.
About the lack of underwear.
``I do not above my head, that he bought from us repeatedly so large quantities of fuses."
``But it's their decision, and they know what they are."
``For us is an army of a good customer, which is as traders trying to comply with," says business manager STV GROUP Jan Děcký.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometers purchased lines, the army will have the stocks of this ``ammunition" at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, is only about four years of the life of the fuses and police or military bomb techs even just about two years.
``In perfect storage it may even be you four," says one of them, who, as a soldier for criticism of the army does not want to publish the name.
After the expiry of the life of each ammunition carefully test, whether it is even more reliable and does not jeopardise troops to life.
These tests, however, are not free and more money.
Another argument is the Ministry of quantitative discount on 445 kilometers incendiary lines.
``It's cost us about sixty percent less than last year' s supply of two hundred kilometres 44," it conveys spokesman Pejšek opinion of the buyer of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: annual consumption of firing sets of lines of police bomb, who destroyed the ammunition from the Second World War or here after the soviet army, does not exceed for several years of 1 500 meters.
And the police are always just such a quantity to this ammunition used before the expiry of life.
It worked her because of the safety of the bomb, and may, in a more flexible way to obtain more modern, and therefore also more reliable types of lines.
The Defense Ministry has already considerable difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when dvousettisícová czechoslovak army was preparing to draw on the Rhine.
The Czech according to the bomb, which MF Dnes said, waiting for a few years, the same problem: will be eliminated, hundreds of miles of the old detonating, which today," ````cheap purchases.

The euphoria of victory quickly replace the impact of the crisis.
Thank you, sir winner, however, has Farmet worse times in a row.
For a price for the first place in the past year Vodafone, the company was last year in slavic house out of the firm's owner Farmet, Karel žďárský.
Then the jury commending efforts, through which built from a small nástrojářské workshop in the Czech Jiřího company with stamilionovými swings.
``I can say that the valuation encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our self - esteem for the game with the competition," says today last year's winner.
At the beginning of the company's history Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered the father of Karl žďárského for Rent little business as compensation for the communists entertained assets, long, refused to career in the company, where he worked, and with a few friends around his father's founded a firm in plastic bath.
Not later they specialise presses vegetable oil.

A viable, the company must be able to do occasional such unpopular measures.
The situation, but we and keep profit, even if it is less than before the crisis.
From what, however, in Farmetu neslevili,'s investment in research and development.
``From the subsidies we built the research and training centre, strengthen we presentation on international trade fairs, received the award in the domestic exhibitions," says žďárský.
Indeed, the crisis is behind them.
Sales for the growing again and with them, the number of new employees.
``The new winners have a pleasant feeling of victory, but in the quiet atmosphere," says Karel žďárský.
Poll, which eliminates pointless rules
Survey of the absurdity of the year's fourth part of the business, competition.
Some of the dense regulations have managed to cancel.
Neslavným winner next year ankety the absurdity of the year became the obligation to wear the Office of the documents, which are also officials accessible on - line.
Decided on more than one - third of less than four thousand voting.
For example, social security administration required a paper excerpt from the Commercial Register, even if the official it may obtain two mouse.
Thanks to a survey, this will change.
``The Czech Social Security Administration has already excerpt from the Commercial Register in controls on taxpayers premiums will require," said a spokesman for ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
Light on all legislation and regulation, which must businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and you can cancel the competition is the point of the absurdity of the year.
It is this year for the part of the business competitions organised by economic newspapers and among the public is increasingly popular.
If the last year's vote participated in about three thousand voting, this year, you have already been nearly four thousand.
And it is no surprise, various legal obligations, which serves only to delay of business, is for us still enough.
``In the number of papers for tax return we are on the front places in the world," notes to Karel Havlíček from the Association of small and medium - sized enterprises and grow of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business in the last few years have become the ostensible aim of all governments.
In comparison with the world, but in the Czech Republic, the situation is much better.

Competition of the absurdity of the year was first published in 2006, and every year in accordance with the same scenario.
Log on administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone annually from April until the end of September, when it is closing competition.
To log serves the address of the website www. firmaroku. cz after the competition organiser selects seven candidates for the ``anticenu" and leave it in the course of October, the vote of the public over the Internet on the website www. firmaroku. cz / an absurdity and www. immediately. cz.
An absurdity, which can get the most votes prevails.
In this year's survey has been applied more than a hundred, 105 legislation and regulation lacking sense.
Tips to entrepreneurs, but also a professional associations, and journalists.
Among the ``finalists" competition is so between the no - for example, the requirement for wagons for the maintenance of new motorways and high - speed roads were tolls, or to entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two agencies and two toilets painted every two years.
List of this year's seven proposals is posted on the website of competition.
Publication of competition, which is always in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenningu, which regularly participates in of the political and social life.
This year, for example, for this climax competition assists Eva Svobodova, director of the Association of small and medium - sized enterprises and grow the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
``Economic prosperity can not work there, where the state's entrepreneurs sticks under his feet, therefore, is my view to cancel each year at least three decades of the law, which today only unnecessarily complicating the business," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to disturb absurd regulation nevyznívá.
In 2007, most people do not have the obligation to entrepreneurs report three days ahead of the Trade Licensing Office in place, where the permanent establishment, intention to go to the exhibition or Festival.
This obligation was deleted an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most hlasovaná obligation in 2007, which was the report's Labour Office for its foreign workers business trip to the extent of up to 30 days, it has been deleted the law on the so - called green card.
And, to a third of all good.
Absurdity of the year 2009 happened regulation fyzioterapeutům have in the mirror, refrigerator and two leghold weight.
It was in this year's decree of the Ministry of Health mitigated - an obligation to have the refrigerator had.

In the land of the Fund in Pilsen police arrested in a public competition
In the building of the Liegenschaftsfonds in Plzeň in the past few days arrest the anti - corruption police.
Handcuffs detectives on the local entrepreneurs in the media sector and businessman with real - estate Luboš G.
The reportedly tried to manipulate the public competition to the settlement of restitution claims to land featured in the competition has acquired a specific candidates.
He had a Luboš G. pay half a million crowns.
``As far as i can only confirm that the police against one person for an offence meddling in a public contract, and at a public competition," said the law of the Pilsen PPO Antony green with that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation can not provide.
Šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs policemen after 24 hours, released for freedom.
On the way in which could affect the public competition can be given to a minimum of official information, only speculate.
A spokesman for the Liegenschaftsfonds Lubomír black on the query law said that on odloučeném the workplace in Pilsen policemen actually arrested, and that during a public competition.
``It was a client, not of our employees," said.
Public competition has, in accordance with the black correct name ``invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land, according to the law on the soil" and takes place in the case of the land interested more qualified applicants.
``These persons in the framework of the challenges they offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer, than was announced the value of the land."
``According to the offered entitlements shall be established order of purchasers and liegenschaftsfonds then converts parcel person, which offered the highest claims," said a spokesman for the Fund.
Luboš G. was probably the information, who is to the challenges volunteered, and because it is also authorised person, because bought a series of restitution claims, offered candidates for land, that competition.
For it is probably got severance payments.
That would explain that he had in detention so large a sum of money.
Luboš G. was above - standard contacts at PF in Plzeň in the past.
Name in the case of former boss, PF Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted for that made in the replacement restitution land, to which it was issued a decision on the location of the building.
Just then gained Luboš G. from the Fund, for example, the land intended for the construction of a public communications, specifically in the place where should build access road in the industrial zone borská fields.
Later, it is very expedient he to a house in the historical centre of the city, who had the value of a much higher.
In this town hall had to accede, because otherwise would land blocking construction threatened.
Households to housing připlatí hundreds of monthly
Households will have to since January overpay, not only for all types of energy, but also for the aqueous and stočné, heat supply and somewhere to grow and rents.
Families will have to since January out of Wallets up to hundreds of CZK 14,370 up more than now.
Electricity more expensive up to 4,6%, gas is about 2% more expensive, up to one - tenth in certain cities will have to pay for the supply of water and often also hike fare from December delivery of the central heat.
Price increases electricity should households in apartments out a year on the stokoruny more than now.
The prices of the force of electricity, all major suppliers reduce, is to blame, a significant increase in aid of the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular, photovoltaics.
The gas is more expensive slightly, at a time when people most drowning and are so high consumption.
A year, thus also must reckon with hundreds of crowns.
While the electricity and gas more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of the central heating is different from the place.
Price increase is mainly larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns a month, moreover, by more than 1,000 crowns per year will pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of the Prague again threatens to them by more than 9 percent more expensive aqueous and stočné, and that, in the event that the city will increase the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent change, připlatí, roasted 6,8 percent.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between the lower.
On the north Bohemia, where already now prices are among the highest, has the aqueous and stočné podražit on 7,4%.
Significantly, for example, may increase the prices of rents in the 450 thousands of rental housing, where since January ends of regulation.
For example, the company CPI flats, which in Ústí nad Labem own about 2500 apartments, intends to since January rent increase to one hundred percent.
Those who are not with the new amount of the hire agree, intends to give the company to court.
Regulated rent paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments, could be the next year will increase by up to ten percent.
The czech children's boozed fernetem and rum.' s beer out of fashion, with slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally, even better brand of whiskey stolen parents.
These are the drinks, after which drinking ends most frequently in the care of doctors drunks, which was not even fifteen years.
The children of a monkey treated in hospital repeatedly.
It follows from the experience of doctors who with similar cases found on the incomes of the children's department hospitals.
``Some beer or wines are completely nemódní, because long before they opijete."
``The trend is certainly hard liquor," said the law of the chief of the children's department of the hospital Hořovice in Central Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
``If they can get out of the father of the cabinet, so it's about the whiskey, but otherwise dominates Fernet and vodka."
``The vodka has the advantage that it pour into juice, and it is not from them, then so much feel," said the chief.
And for him it gives even the Speaker of the Faculty Hospital Sunbeam travel.
``I do not often it is Fernet or rum."
``It's modern alcohol in particular on primary schools."
``In some cases the Mark, which had brought from home," said Jurinová.
According to the chief pelican are thirteen or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in a hospital income relatively commonplace.
Before Hořovicemi, where operates from this year, he worked for ten years on pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulance all podroušené students from a wide surroundings.
``One girl with us lay about four times."
````Career initiated in twelve years, when her to us brought with 3,5 per mille of the blood alcohol, moreover, in combination with ecstasy," said the doctor particularly a serious case.
``It was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice on some dance party."
``It's interesting that her mother did a special, that his daughter 48 hours," said the chief.
It is the lack of the parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking of their own children are often considered the main cause of the growing child pijanství.
On the basis of in the strict sense of the word, however, according to experts in children to speak.
``Under the concept of an alcoholic means a multi - year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena, which it belong, and that, for children's."
``Those who alcohol used repeatedly, is more like a good family - social background," explained the Pelican.
According to a spokesman Jurinové this year on pediatric clinic in Motol committed in mid - November roughly forty drunken children.
The statistics are, however, will you with a heavy intoxikací, which had to stay in the hospital.
Child of drunkards, following the ambulance treatment take parents, where appropriate, is home to the police did not count.
Except in cases where the children just sit down after school and drank a bottle of brandy, there are referred to in the first three seasonal fluctuations, to which we can rely on: a witch, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
``It either celebrating the grief of the wrong transcript, or, on the contrary, they are celebrating the beginning of the holidays."
``Of course on a witch was on the income of seven children's drunks suddenly," said Pelican.
A drunk, who spend the night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, is paradoxically the advantage compared to that of the second day at home suffer a hangover.
The morning headaches caused by the dehydration and lack of glucose, off irrigation lvs with glucose and nutrients, which organism are missing.
``They are at it better, because they are after that beautiful evening experience and good awakening and nothing is hurt."
``Only they are confused from where they are," he admitted pelican with that occasionally corrupt patients a mood of at least a list of the costs, which their treatment required.
The ambulance and hospitalization at acute bed, comes to tens of thousands of crowns.
``Sometimes i apply as an educational resource, when i directly these children, then on rounds said, how much of their drunkenness and stood that could also spending the entire summer on the brigade, to make money on the one party," he added Pelican.
Health insurance companies, however, according to him to s management, in which after the parents enforce the costs of treatment, in cases of children's drunks proceed.
The two L - 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
The two L - 159 from a total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence an exchange of transport plane Casa c - 295 M, Tuesday left in spanish Seville, where aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS.
It is the first time that the machines of this type of appeared in the ownership of someone else than the Czech Army.
In a foreign country has only been in exercises or Oprávnění years.
It's about the two versions of l - 159 T 1, which has not yet been engaged in the Czech Army and which were available.
The remaining three machines are single L - 159.
You are zakonzervované in Aeru Vodochody and the provider of trade - omnipol - it took over the last week.
When aeroplanes physically came from Vodochod, is not in accordance with the Jana Pejška from the Press Department of Defense has not yet known.
````Single aeroplanes L - 159 for shift have been removed from the long - term imposed by the aircraft, and that without further deposits and investment by the Ministry of."
``Two L - 159 T 1 were converted into the current state and form," said law Pejšek.
He added that the military without a two - seat trainers aircraft, because the Ministry of in May 2009 signed with Aerem Vodochody contract in the $200 million crowns for reconstruction of four unnecessary machines L - 159 on two of these machines.
One of the new plane was taken over by the Army in July, the second takes over by the end of this year.
According to the Pejška the EADS, undertook to aeroplanes prevails in the armament of some of the NATO countries.
``In the contract is clearly stated that the buyer of aeroplanes L - 159 is the company EADS, and will be used for the training of pilots from the countries of NATO."
``It is therefore a matter of customer, how this thing to be implemented," said Pejšek.
Reuters ahead of time indicated that, e. g. the spanish army of l - 159 has no interest.
The exchange of five L - 159 for one of the planes Casa and the purchase of the other three aircraft for 3,5 billion crowns approved the last year, the government Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Ministry nevypsalo for the purchase of a selection procedure and touched directly EADS.
The leadership of Defense argued that shift will support the future of the export of l - 159 abroad.
Czech Army from Aero bought 72 machines and uses only 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of aircraft Casa is likely to have and judicial farce.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence sued the European Court, therefore, that should aircraft select, on the basis of the pan - european tender and not addressed one producer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last should at Prague Airport kbely come within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates the lower risk cancer
The men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger, are less exposed to the risk that gets the prostate cancer.
It is surprising conclusion of the study, which was published in the center of the british magazine cancer.
It may be related to the surface of the male hormone testosterone.
``Our results show that the relative length finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, in particular for men to 60 years," said co - author of the study Ros Eelesová, Professor Cancer Institute at the University of Warwick University.
The finger might help determine who men should take the test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with a genetic risk or other threatening factors, such as the family health burden, she added Eelesová.
In the period 1994 - 2009 watched with colleagues in Britain, more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and in parallel over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants of the study should index finger on the right hand of less than the ring finger.
Paid for the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19% of those whose fingers were of equal length.
In the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger, however, this risk declined by 33%, for a man in his late fifties decrease in even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of these two fingers - shaped by in prenatal period - perhaps reflects the different levels of hormones, which is a child issued in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a finger.
Earlier studies have shown that testosterone supports the growing prostate cancer.
The front czech geneticist and a former President of the Academy of Sciences of Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that on this study, he knows, but i do not seem to him, that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer was ``entirely by" .

Ice cream University
``Gelato University" near Bologna preparing zmrzlinoví candy man to better annual period.
The base rate for the future shake, which takes three days, is a big interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
Where is the ice cream?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, czech a little obsolete zmrzlinář, produces cream according to all the rules of the italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio she scraper of ice cream cooler, rubbed her into the waffles and sells.
To this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
Who wants to, but for more on the ice cream, this will avoid the ``Gelato - the University of italian companies Carpigiani.
In 2003, a producer of ice - cream machines ice cream university, that ice cream from his machines answered everywhere high italian ideals.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which takes three days, is a huge interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
Offers shall but also several days of special courses of chocolate ice cream and practice in their own zmrzlinárně.
Someone wants in his Midlife - Crisis after a new career, others will venture out on thin ice their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all the worlds - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, the art teacher from California, loves movement Slow Food and wanted to be in the future to offer a high - quality european product in the country's industrial Ice - Cream.
Anke from Berlin's business a consultant and would after years stressful job to start something of his own.
Two young Egypťanky dream of in Kairu open zmrzlinárnu.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of the ice - cream in its bars - and canadian homemaker Julia, because of her children love italian ice cream.
Maestro - Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain to the participants in an ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not the only good taste, but also the silk softness and good consistency.
Do not forget, during his training at the southern and patriotic put the icing on the cake: ``the Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it was still notná dose of romance."
The first step of the production of appears to be relatively simple.
Luciano inserts basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a great mixer, all by electronic program to 85 degrees and subsequently now cool to four degrees.
Then he turns to tap and was pasterizovaný white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk - based ice - cream.
Immediately is Lecturer in issues: it is possible to make an ice cream only from natural substances, without stabilizer?
How can a man alone experiment?
Luciano warns, to be carried away by the spirit of the times, into the unknown.
Who speaks about ice cream ``only from natural ingredients" , probably as used stabilizers - the majority of a natural product, as is Guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make an ice cream, even without stabilizers, but to sell during one day, otherwise you sour and customer her the same ice seeds.
Certain variations of the matter is permissible.
More excitin's will be with flavouring essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes at the taste of ice cream, according to the ingredients, which buying in the supermarket, either in the department with fruit or in the Department of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
````Suppliers trying to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients."
``You should but simply experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream of white fundamental matter, changes the eggs at the yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for some chocolate temptation.
Now may be involved in the exchange rate to an ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them produce always four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lískooříškové ice - cream - either with the eggs or without them in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall also be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée - whereas taste that it is not always better.
Lískooříšková ice cream may enjoy more butter pecan, when it contains more hazelnut.
Most popular kiwi ice cream produced the group, which use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced combination of highlighting the right taste Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice - cream is purely Computational task: if used peach purée with a lot of sugar, must be reduced the share of sugar in the basic recipe.
In the case of lemon ice - cream is the need for an extra ration of sugar.
Luciano she apparatus, which specifies the sugar content in fruit (vintners that measured must from grapes).
The tables, fortunately, reduce the number of.
The production of ice - cream already does not require much physical exertion as before.
Do not only for automatic production of basic material.
There is also the machine, which was ice cream mixture of simultaneously umíchá into the cream and cool to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation evasions small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo dirty and also their colleagues from top to bottom fruit purée, when he gets out of control of the huge mixer.
``At any rate," believes Maestro Luciano, ``it is only a matter of time, when this happens."
Auditors in duplicate light
The European Food Authority Efsa is consistent with the industry, which have been experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge now expressed the Group of experts Testbiotech, which is deemed to be an independent Institute for estimate of the consequences of biotechnology.
``It sounds like a conspiracy theory, we are but well documented," said Wednesday in Munich, boss Testbiotechu Christoph then.
The Head of the expert group Efsa for gentechnicky changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert Efsa have already several years of the contract with the Union of lobbies Ilsi.
This is financed by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper contributed decisively to control regulations Efsa for genetic plants and so in the bright conflicts of interests, criticizes then.
The provisions Efsa to agree in paragraphs with the documents Ilsi and are so manuscript industry, which should be controlled by the Office of the Italian in Parma.
It is no longer a second time, what Testbiotech points to a conflict of interest.
Recently passed high manager of Efsa without additions or a transitional period to the Swiss agrárnímu concern Syngenta - and thus changed party.
Also radio for Central Germany (MDR) has recently personnel interconnection of the EU - the Office for the control of industrial lobbies, which raised interest as the Department of Environment, so the members of the EU.
In the meantime, can not Efsa recognize the conflict of interest.
Working with all serious data, and therefore also those of industry, if they are highly professionally quality, it is stated in a single declaration.
From experts, who work for Efsa, are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But it must demonstrate.
Kuiper confesses his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
Itself becomes a neutral expert forum of science, industry and policy - in addition to estimate of the risk of biotechnology without a contract lobbyists.
Independent experts like then criticize, that are currently vacation gentechnicky changed plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the reaction of genetic testing plant to environmental influences.
``We want to know what to do, for example, gentechnicky modified maize in the field," says he.
The current practice is the only test isolated proteins, not a genetic plant, which they can demonstrate reliable results.
``If you are looking for the risks, how would then can find them?" asks fingers then.
Agrees Angelica Hilbeck.
Scientific worker examines gentechniku since 1994, and is currently working on the technical high school in Zurich.
In this area is trying to industry, as in the US, now also in Europe still more affect or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, almost there are scientists, who are not connected with the Hills.
A majority shall publish studies, which are for the company's critical.
``The industry controls the security research," believes Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also some issuing a total of about 400 pounds.
On Monday night stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: in September arrived earthmovers and began to tear at a large piece of Northern wings.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S 21, miliardovému reduction in the station.
When they reached the halt, lay the majority of the wings in ruins.
Broken to 6000,7000 pieces.
The limestone from Crailsheim, soft rough stone, which were used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years.
He took a few of these pieces.
``These stones are relics."
``Shall not disappear."
Was: ``cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one, the smell after cigarette smoke.
What about those pieces will do not know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trail of the stones from Stuttgart leads into the woods near TUBINGEN on the former deponii ammunition of the french army, where Manuel Rongen his stone empire.
44 - year - old man deals with the old stones.
He bought all incurred during the cutting in Stuttgart.
``It would be a shame if rozemlely on the gravel or fled to the deponii," says in his office, wooden box, which was previously a house.
Says that he swore and threatening him, when in September in all the papers, that he bought the remains of the Northern wings from the company, which carries out demolition.
But he was the whole days with adversaries with - 21.
And he explained that, for the demolition of you can not.
And when it's going on, then it is reasonable, when the stones are in use.
Then took about 200 p - 21 - opponents, each one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6,50 to 14 of the euro.
As a memory, some also, in the hope that it back again.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes of cargo, 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the woods, the rest of the time he sold.
Gardeners, krajinní gardeners, builders of home.
And they came from all corners of the and dragged, what resided in the trunk, and to the caravan.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart had long into ``wall" or as a border, with herbs.
``This stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
``If it was not for the political inserts."
Getting into his field of the car and go for a ride after its 20 - you hektarovém Kingdom.
He studied the first rights, interrupted study, later biology, then was interested in computers and eventually became a trader with stones.
And lover of stones.
He has saved 40000 tonnes of stones.
Tie their treasures from the whole of Germany.
He says, that is the largest businessman with old stones in the Czech Republic.
Hamper.
In the snow lying artistically hewn sandstone.
``Once belonged to Marien - bridge in Dresden," says.
Sandman from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is happy.
``My favorite stone."
Let's go up the road through the forest.
Shows on a pile of: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And further.
``Nice travertine."
Once belonged to the blocks to the grandstand Neckarstadionu in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lying stones and stories, Cannstatt - travertine from Police Presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple, Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronnu.
What kind of work, what the exertion, what the sweat.
When Rongen thinks about it manually break stones and carried by simple tackles and bull carriages, becomes quite respectful.
``It would seem a scandal, if something like that crashing."
I became rich, very rich.
A businessman with stones now employs 14 people and, in addition, the top in the woods settled masons, a sculptor, one of the smith, one Sklář and one of the gardener.
``We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says that, who has appreciated.
In the foreseeable future must to Cologne.
Also there will save the stones.
The battle of talent of the High - potentials
In the case of refreshments is a lot of people.
16 students is pressing for sandwiches with Salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
Technical University in Braunschweig and the manufacturer of cars Volkswagen invited students engineering and the design on the workshop.
Together with the company's here to talk about the car of the future - and the only way to get to know the Volkswagen.
Many firms are trying to in the establishment of the smartest heads, as well as the company, to succeed and is betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible recruit in the lecture theatre best graduates, before you get to the labour market and will be of interest in others.
Since the universities coming from no lists of the success of their students, trying to firms find exceptional talent in projects oriented on the practice and get them.
The Braunschweig is trying to the automotive concern to obtain the talents of the next day.
One of the young lady from personal department gives a ballpoint pen, jellybeans and plates with the logo.
He tells the budding young talent on programmes in practice, student jobs and suggests them on the way to the concern.
Nico Selle from here Braunschweig cares about the project, together with the VW.
He sees the benefits for both parties: ``students in contact with industry and gain experience."
````VW may, at the same time to get to know the students, to meet interesting candidates and think about what should be as a partner."
Such cooperation, according to the Selle, are not uncommon.
News, but it is, that is so openly fighting for students.
````Otherwise was more substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably even harder.
In many sectors firms can no longer to collect their employees from the long lines of candidates.
It must, on the other hand, try and trying to attract very highly skilled labour.
Graduates from engineering disciplines have excellent negotiating position.
According to the Union of german engineers VDI remained in October 2004 40.000 engineering positions.
And, according to the projections VDI, i. e. the lack of engineers will only increase.
For the audit and consulting firm KPMG's Roman Dykta hunting of talent.
Organises demanding Recruiting - events, such as KPMG - Race, the nature of modern factory, the treasure, in which they must find a way in accordance with the co - ordinates GPS.
The company plans to the next year, send as follows eight promising students, after the US.
The participants may also examine branches KPMG and become familiar with the company.
In advance to decide in two selection rounds, who will participate.
Only the crème de la crème from many candidates, it's going to go to the US.
In the competition for High Potentials at universities will pay according to Dykty still more restrictive laws.
``We want to our Race differ from the other."
``A simple trip to the sailboat was for us too little."
It seems that scout Dykta lucky.
``We stayed in touch with all participants similar actions in the past year."
``Some will soon graduate and planned for us to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to the direct reaching on campus, small and medium - sized firms themselves for labor markets.
``We are trying to contact graduates at exhibitions."
``Such as Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, the Head of the Human Resources Department of the manufacturer of the solar technology Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs in Germany around 1500 employees.
Stübe knows issues with young workers.
He is currently listed 35 positions on the website of the company.
``We are currently it's difficult, fill vacancies."
``It's worth a lot of time and money," he says.
The other option is to contact via professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with different universities, e. g. the university in Freibergu.
````Professors informed that it is possible to do practice or write thesis."
Solar specialist hold no expensive advertising actions.
Instead of trying to the company to attract other benefits: the personal atmosphere, low hierarchy, and the light of communication.
``The big groups that often can not offer," says the personal department Stübe.
Job search for a long time to make money, the main role.
A flexible working hours, custody of children or good options procedure are other relevant factors.
Solarworld occupied in one study of the Institute of Great Place it work 55. place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best german employers.
In addition, requires co - workers, how they are satisfied with his work, and the environment and monitor the framework conditions employees.
The Head of personal department Stübe hopes that her location brings points for candidates for the job.
``I believe that the candidates shall inform, especially on the external evaluations potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the german Employer Branding Academy counsels companies, which you want to build a long - term strategy of the good reputation as an employer.
Advise their customers, to be more autentičtí.
And, according to Mr. Krieglera it means, above all, internal measures.
``The best way to raise the visibility like an attractive employer leads through his own staff," he says.
Technically it is called the internal Employer Branding, i. e., the enforcement of the employer's share of the market in the framework of their own staff.
``Happy employees are the best envoys."
When the company good care for their people, and they identify with the company, then they will be themselves to advertise his employer between friends and acquaintances.
``It's a game with string," says Kriegler.
Obama is stopping the new oil drilling
During the following years will be incurred before the US - the Federal Florida State in the Gulf of Mexico's new oil wells.
The government in Washington, D. C., issued a corresponding to the prohibition - and thus withdrawn definitively earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast are not new drilling prohibited.
The Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar it informed Wednesday.
The reason strict ban, who should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion to drilling Tower of the ``Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which was eleven employees of life and led to the disaster of the environment in the US, signaled President Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and industry of their willingness to, afford new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocates of this trying to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
To date is clearly explained, who is responsible for a devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of the criticism is the british energetic concern BP, which is confronted miliardovými applications.
The commission of enquiry, which was responsible for Obama, should submit to the results of the during December.
In October abolished the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar prohibition drilling, who paid from the explosion.
Subsequently, the various petroleum concerns the application to new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar catastrophe stricter checks and striktními security provisions.
It is currently a fundamental reform of the Audit Office, which said many corruption charges.
At the same time, the Obama announced that he cancels lucrative options tax evasion for oil and gas Hills.
Industry now openly warned that stricter regulations substantially reduce the volume of excavated oil in the Gulf.
``The government's plans are the biggest impediment to the growth of the gas and oil industry," is the result of the exploration of the current in the field of advisory firm BDO - before the drilling Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance has yet to complain of uncertainty in the field: ``nobody knows exactly what is the regulation of change."
Investments in new mining projects to appeal to push - at the expense of growth.
The area Ogoni burned down
The water in the rivers is olejově brown, it smells like a gas station: billion gallons of oil escaped destroyed nature in the field of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People are stealing, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
``Do not worry," says journalists environmental activist: ``today, you will receive before the lens enough yet oil mud."
37 - year - old Nigeriánec watched the attempt to take a picture of the boy, which is wading after the breast of water, flanked by streaks: the scene in the aquatic luster with a rainbow almost nice.
That, under the surface of the swimming brown clots of oil, you can not see.
Previously here collected in containers enough garnel," says Esther Badom on the bank of the river Bodo - Jetty.
In the meantime, became slowly resulting water completely dead.
Five years ago, spilled into a warm area of broken leadership large amounts of oil.
The fishermen from the nearby town Bodo must paddle at least six hours to get into the waters, where are the fish: area Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger River delta belong to one of the worst of the infected area in the world.
On the way down the river mangrove - tree swamps, with a lot of the side of it's only a whole range of the trigger.
The engine on the boat cooks, instead of light brown water and who dipped his hand in the water, out of the fingers.
The roots of mangrovníků rises from the country as a black beanpole liquorice, rarely occurring palm are letting their leaves sadly hang.
In vain we are looking for flocks of birds, which is normally in damp areas exist: once you die engine on the boat, no in earlier paradise, where it smells like a gas station, the eerie silence.
``What is going on here,'s environmental leadership of war," says sadly celestine Akpobari: ``we live in a constant fear of health."
A comparison with the war is justified.
The settlement Ogoni is a battlefield, where over the past few decades fights: more than 60 years ago came crowding the first conquerors from Europe, here in the 1980's by the first resistance with later executed a writer Ken Saro Wiwa -, here to concern Shell stop in 1993, their production, because it was for employees too dangerous.
Still in the field of Ogoni may not company back: while the daily benefit from the entire area of the Delta a triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometers of more than two million barrels of black gold, lies the oil fields in the field of Ogoni fallow, for the concern is the situation very unstable.
Every few hundred yards rises from the water steel structure as grotesque statues: ``Christmas trees" , so, too, called the heads of the drilling holes.
They are 50 years old, most to the rusty.
Any minute break, such as the head of the vrtného hole," says Akpobari, and then comes a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to estimates of experts had turned into the ecosystem Delta in more than two billion litres for 50 years: each year a quantity of oil, which had turned into the sea from Alaska in the crash supertankeru ``Exxon Valdez" of 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes, who is to continue to lasting ecological disaster responsible.
While the Shell indicates sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90% of pollution, this is the protectionists environmental about the crackling Titles wells and netěsných lines as the main cause.
Shell requires in Nigeria, much less security regulations than it is in the world, accused the trust in 2008 US - american researcher Richard Steiner: only the quantity of disorders lines is ``several times higher than elsewhere."
On the spot, which looks like a distant deserted, oil grime workshop under the open sky, will emerge from mangrovníků figures: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are part of the leadership, partly arbitrarily scattered across the country, a fire: illegal small refinery.
Oil is in a barrel over the fire was heating for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First of leadership in záchytného pots gas, later dripping at the end of the leadership of kerosene and eventually NAFTA.
In this way it produces Michael and his four associates a day four barrels after 300 litres: ``we are so 34.000 naira" - about $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta use a chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil State black Africa.
Nigeria's own only one refinery.
Ridiculously low price of 40 cents euro per litre of naphtha may illegal producers still trump: because they have the raw materials for free.
Comes from the ``bunkerů" who are the lowermost limits on leadership everywhere in the field of Ogoni: according to experts in the field of Niger River delta is losing ground daily at least 16 million gallons of oil.
But only negligibly small part of temporarily stored raw materials illegally improved: the largest share with organised criminal networks, to which they have belonged to politicians and senior officials of the army, into the tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether caused disaster inhabitants and their interventions or lax method of production, considers the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
``If the thought of the oil company for intruders, and if so completely destroy the essence of the fishermen, then would not sabotage, nor the theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, it is but a relationship Ogoni primarily to Shell so damaged, that seems only into consideration the departure of the concern: ``may prove other nations like the Chinese as a better."
Michael folks.
``It's time to go," says the muscular producer.
``Every moment can come soldiers."

Thousands of mourning for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people uctilo souvenir buried miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
Still failed to rescue the dead, because in the shaft's security situation continues to complicated.
Almost two weeks ago occurred in Pike River passes near the town of Greymouth to strong explosion.
29 miners in age from 17 to 62 years was in the mine swamped with.
Into the shaft, where the disaster was running the probe, but found no trace of life.

To hell, warriors!
It's horror for artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome again the old border, with its fighting the epic of ``Walhalla Rising."
The audience thought the danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when you are ``Walhalla Rising" ?
Captured a Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be free from their torturers, and in large kills almost with a supernatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideally for young men's viewers who seek a bloody actions, because our hero helps ruthless methods of killing and their enemies tearing even from the abdominal viscera alive, when she' s in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the one - eyed, how it is, in fact, called, during the whole of the film he does not say a word and other forms of a more than one or two sentences or be swayed by the painful dying.
Otherwise, the silent and rich in the beautiful hilly landscape, Scotland, which offers the background to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal more adult enthusiasts movies with interest on existencializmus and very quiet footage of the camera.
It is good, when it's film more target groups, it is a shame, when are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, then what made his wild and stylizovanou trilogy of drug dealers ``Pusher" , it is considered to be the danish version of the director's Quentin Tarantino, calmly, but from their works approached either more humor mainstream of or less the brutality of an audience.
Most of the artistic movies seem to have dissuaded everywhere stříkajícím brain and guts.
Supporters of the action films are unudí no later than at the moment when the one - eyed issue from freely explain the reasons with a group of violent christian missionaries in Jerusalem, and will be hanging forever in the wind and the fog, than to get the crew to America and in there are silent.
There is therefore no wonder that, in Germany, the ``Walhalla Rising" in movie theaters, and now it was issued only on DVD.
It's a pity, mainly due to the beautiful záběrům, but also because the distinctive façade,, broken blood, hiding exciting cinema, which worthy of attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or the exact, everything is the atmosphere, dream, who became a film.
And it is for the spectator escape.
Refn him not even a moment of release and slowly it stifles its freezing footage and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, in particular, but the ineffable hatred, which ones from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, which helps to one - eyed, left something like innocence, all of the others are driven by malice.
Most of all, one - eyed hero, whose motives are never explained that happens in time for enemies and transitional allies warrior from hell, maybe envoy of the devil.
Acts out destruction, perhaps, but also the only for those wicked.
````Walhalla Rising" is puzzling film that it is possible to hate and admire, for the angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
The mysterious earthworks
The Office for nuclear power, the IAEA has a new notification of covert nuclear program in Syria.
The country's but it expression - and do not allow checks.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 attack at least four israeli combat airplanes f - 15 and mysterious square building in Syria.
Standing on the shore Euphratu; the greater the city's remote 30 kilometers and his name is Dair as - Saur.
In the documents the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) appears her name, when it comes to the reactor, which supposedly put Syria, with the help of North Korea in this square schovaném in the valley, which turns from the stream.
On the basis of a communication from the US - american foreign intelligence service, the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the village el - Kibar, suitable for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950's to nothing else.
The CIA has presented a video with nezaostřenými with satellite imagery.
By using the computer animation clarify, where which components of the reactor before the destruction of might be, it is to act on a diminishing, a copy of the North Korea's model of the nuclear Centre Yongbyon.
Moreover, there were submitted by the photographs, which showed the building up close, or even from the inside.
The reactor was shortly before running, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, did not know much more than that, even with the time increased.
Former US President George W. Bush recently in his memoirs disclosed that the CIA was before the attack very sure that Syria is building in el - Kibar reactor, but in fact should not supporting documents that are in the country is ``active nuclear weapons program."
Some of the rapporteurs secret services in Europe are even more cautious, and talk only about ``the reactor" , even if the presentation of the CIA regarded as ``convincing."
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how is sure that has a reactor, replied in the summer of high un diplomat, the IAEA has ``enough material to questions."
The rubble of the supposedly ``unused military buildings" was the Syrians quickly while odklizená and also duly zarovnali terrain.
Yet managed to find in June 2008 team the IAEA, under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el - Kibar traces of uranium, which was made people.
In addition, received the IAEA across the Member State satellite photos of commercial sellers of immediately after the attack, which should be better than those presented the CIA.
Unfortunately, these are not shown on the market, because it is exclusively bought the unknown, the customer - maybe Israel.
The IAEA therefore can not confirm their identity.
Syria has always claimed that had never had a secret nuclear program and did not oppose the reactor.
Uranium comes from the israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the myth of the IAEA after an analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite footage.
In addition, the disabled revizorům the second inspection in el - Kibar and access to the ruins of rozbombardované buildings.
But also Israel obstinately silent.
``We will never comment," said recently official position at the time of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is fruitless since June 2008 and ``grows into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the Office," as he admitted a western diplomat in the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - it is not a serious breach of contract on the abolition of nuclear weapons, to which the IAEA monitoring.
The IAEA is considered to be the key to take forward in the matter of the three other devices, to be ``in working concentration" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike him still exist.
Examiners, so far, or on which the device is not what they are function or why they are suspicious.
According to the information newspapers Sueddeutsche Zeitung is the IAEA internally indicates as Marj as - Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again, according to the nearby towns.
An independent of the Institute for Science and the International Security in Washington, D. C., (Isis) identified these objects and found on the satellite scans complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
Perhaps it is inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason refuses to Syria IAEA access to these three points.
In Vienna was that the Syrians afraid of the so - called ``fishing expedition - that would be the IAEA in advance of the seconded by the US, to find a military base.
The nuclear detectives were notified of the device intelligence service in the US.
The IAEA has evidence and also the satellite imagery, that between these three places and square for Euphratu transported material here and there.
In Vienna said a western diplomat, that at least one furnished should be ``in connection with the production of fuel" .
But there are ``no evidence of senzibilních activities," i. e., about uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of the reactor is driven by a uranium, which is enriched.
But where the uranium is and where it later to split the plutonium for a bomb, to these central questions, there are only likely estimates.
It is also known, whether the debris, which could hide important evidence, are kept on these three places.
Like disappeared from the face of the earth hundreds of the costs of freight wagons, nobody seems to have the information, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometers from el - Kibar remote and, on the other hand, Euphratu lying mine al - Tibni, which left Syria check in 1998 as appropriate warehouse for the radioactive waste, considers the IAEA is considered unlikely.
In the past, the IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in connection with the reactor in one of the analysis of the satellite imagery for the prestigious journal of Jane's Intelligence Review.
The pictures of the universe but show that, after the IAEA requested access, Syria on all suspects places earthworks and eliminate large containers.
It could be a coincidence, but it did not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, speaks diplomatic circles about it, that the IAEA spent many months, the creation of a plan for revizory, which would allow Syria retaining any military secrets - only that shows how large is interest revizorů.
Damascus, meanwhile, has refused to this proposal, too.
If a year ago, said western diplomats in Vienna, that's the reactor, broken, and therefore the thing burn, this is already a few months, US ambassador Glyn Davies on the so - called ``special inspections, which is one of the most brutal funds, which has the Vienna nuclear Authority to implement controls.
The boss of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, which would have to propose inspections, already spoke of ``options, which, in the future, i tend" , but so far, hesitating.
This choice of a great deal of risk: on the one hand, it is necessary for that purpose of the majority in the Council, the IAEA and many of the 35 countries has certainly interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat notes: ````what happens when, in the end, they will find nothing?"
Love in times of war
Since then, what Angelina Jolie began in the summer of work on still nameless &amp; prvotině, there is a problem.
She wrote the script, this is a love story of women from Bosnia and men from Serbia.
Much more did not yet know - but also cause unrest.
It was talking about the woman, which is a Muslim, love during the war in Yugoslavia in Serbia of a man who raped her.
The Bosnian women's clubs immediately protest, so the hastily shifted the planned filming from Sarajevo in Hungary.
The film in Hungary dotočil and is in the post - production, in bosensku but still protesting.
Bakir Hasecic from the organisation of women's VICTIMS wrote over un - organization to help the refugees UNHCR Jolie and demanded a meeting with an actress, informed now bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the UN Ambassador - organization to help the refugees.
It is not just a diplomatic - offered women already weeks before the meeting in Hungary, which but rejected.
The meeting shall be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the campsite, where znásilňovalo, love stories place and the position of the Jolie to victims betrays enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended un - organization to help the refugees, to Jolie dismissed as the ambassador, inform the Guardian.
The scenes exactly wrote Jolie?
The bosnian Ministry of culture, which was given to read her scenario, relaxed in smaller expended in Sarajevo filming - it is not entirely clear why then Jolie yet to come.
The young, author of stresses that, in his film tracking no political intentions, with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that he wants to show the horrible consequences of war and all interested parties to give room.
Whereas the content remains uncertain.
On the Internet is still one version of the film, which is a very different: the lovers was known before the start of the war and again to meet, when she is like the Bosnian Muslim zavlečená in Serbia camp, where he serves as the guardian.
Which really is very different than ``rape victim falls into his tormentor" .
The fact that the film Jolie really begins already before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that it is under pressure, ``that's not fair and is based on incorrect information."
Now she can get it's hekeři from Hollywood: that published illegally on the Internet her scenario, how it many times.
Nothing than gone
This evening, it is once again good for the Irish.

They even by 2015 with €200.000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4,5 million people, it is essential loss.
If the forecasts confirm, there will be a similar expatriate wave, what protrpělo Ireland in the 1980's.
After a decade of the rise, which brought the Irish great wealth is now the widening again unhappiness.
The economic crisis znejišťuje primarily young, well - educated, who had seen only rise.
The loss of jobs, and social descent seemed to be in these years boom of the absurd.

About what it is to build something somewhere else, knows for half a year Seán O 'Donovan.

``Goodbye, it sounds alarmingly."
``Call it a party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The normal practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America grows, as well as support for the private business.
Crime is greater than the concerns of unemployment.
And Brazil, many of the regions considers it's more powerful than the United States.
It is some of the results of the survey Latinobarómetro, which took place in the 18 countries, and walked exclusively in the Economist.
Since the survey held since 1995, so may follow changes in attitudes across the entire area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and at the beginning of October, dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America is fairly cheerful mood.
The second is an increase in the stability of the attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific in South America has significantly increased (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where is from the year 2002 economic growth in the average 6% per year, increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Increased also in Mexico, where the economics of recovering from deep decline in production in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated areas, are convinced democrats, which is the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the entire area gives satisfaction with it, as in their country of democracy works in practice, this is the same number as the last year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it was about 25%, this is a big increase (Figure 3).
Roughly 34% said that they have confidence in the Vedek in his country and 45% of trust in the government, once again, this is about the same numbers as in the past year, but there's a difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago has undermined democracy in Latin America, the economic crisis.
The aid during the global financial crisis is likely to be on the grounds that many latin american countries suffered only a recession, and with a strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger network of social security would help protect the poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, announced that the ratio of latinoameričanů living in poverty has increased in 2009 only slightly and in this year again fell to 32%.)
But the mood is amended in a broad range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Strong economic performance, Brazil, and its popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted the meaning of for progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where there was a serious recession and worsened the violent crime.
Only the second time since began to carry out surveys, see more of the respondents across Latin America as the most important problem crime, rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Roughly 31%, says that either they or their close relatives became, in the last year of the victims of crime, but it's decline in comparison with the indication 38% from last year, and it is also the lowest number since 1995.
Masivnější economic performance is reflected in the growing support for entrepreneurship, and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the entire area, says that private enterprise is necessary for the development of, this percentage has increased from 56% from the year 2007 (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agrees that a market economy is the only system, which will allow the development of their country, this percentage has increased from 47% from last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela is of the same opinion (and 80% there supports private enterprise), although their leftist president Hugo Chávez expropriating many private firms.
Brazil's country, who has a leading position in the area, as mentioned 19% of respondents (as opposed to 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year)
Nevertheless, the United States are considered the most influential country of the respondents in Mexico, and in a large part of the Central America, while Venezuela is pleased to meet the success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected that will be the general election in Haiti, on 28 November perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders, who's trying to help the country affected, to be afraid.
Elections were filling with urns and repeating the vote, the ballots rozmetané after channels, broken electoral room and intimidation.
The room open for hours late.
Many Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of January the earthquake wandering around, trying to find, where they can go to vote.
Some of them it finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few anticipated předběžců shouted, that's fraud and called for the abolition of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond mulet, a senior officer of the UN in Haiti, said that the ``, in many ways, it was a pretty good elections."
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community carefully, they said, ``do not believe that these inconsistencies, whether they were any serious, not necessarily have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are committed to René Prévalovi, unpopular a President and its candidate Jude Célestinovi, has to notify the preliminary results of 7 December.
The decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All of the electoral hopes are not lost.
The two of the leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rap and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from its original appeals to the vote was declared invalid.
But the problem can occur if Mr. Célestin, which has little or negligible support among voters, will be marked Electoral Commission for it, that has reached the decisive battle.
Because of the delirious cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people, who after the earthquake still living in tents, there were fears that the electoral participation is low.
Finally, many Haitians to vote, but because of dezorganizace them in that it was prevented.
Roughly 250 grand identity documents, which are necessary for the vote, remained shortly before the election undistributed.
There's too much at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is now clear that the Haitians make themselves.
He tiptoed to the center
In the weeks, when suddenly widowed, benefit Cristina Ferndndez, Argentina's president, from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity increased from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since it was in the year 2007 elected.
Yet the reversal of this success in the successful campaign for a second term in elections in the next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernándezová relinquishes nekompromisnosti my late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstora Kirchner.
And on these characteristics are all based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and, after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of budgeting, which downgrading tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first pair spend more revenue as it pleases.
The government of Mrs Fernándezové lost in the last year in the Congress of the majority.
But the opposition is divided and was further destabilised in the death of Mr. Kirchner to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist join Mrs. Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which were hitting and blaming the government of corruption), Congress could not approve of the budget for year 2011.
``I am not going to argue," said the President.
The budget for the year 2010 will now also apply to the next year, while the president will have more room to spend as it pleases.
The economy is overly Overheating: this year's likely growth to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speaks about number, which are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, which took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, the priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than on controlling inflation.
Has refused to deal with the IMF, with the private sector and cleaned INDEC, statistical agency, which has acceded to monitor the official inflation statistics.
It may now, the president of the Fernándezová moderated this policy?
Called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say, they are in the next year to restrict the wage growth to 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth in world prices for exports argentine agricultural products.
But inflation impeding growth, based on a large devaluation in 2002.
It may be the reason why Mrs President Fernándezová suggests that he wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with the bondholders, who had refused to debt restructuring, which Argentina in 2001 paid.
Now faces Mrs President Fernándezová agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which he owes roughly 6,7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact was on the IMF surveillance, as usual.
But last month Amado they will, the Minister of the economy, announced that the Fund will provide the ``technical assistance" that was designed a new national spotřebitelsko - price index, which will remind the introduction to cleaning INDEC.
It is still unclear whether, Madam President Fernándezová will want to remain in politics, after the end of his term of office, when my husband's at her side.
If you want to stay, needs to gain the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the return of Argentines from the summer vacation in March, it will be a wave of sympathy decline.
If he wants to win the next election, it will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to quietly to forgo many views, which her husband in politics.
Half an encouragement to China
Taiwanese voters are closer closer to the mainland.
What do Taiwan thinks about his big brother across the sea?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November mayor and the Council of the town in five urban circuits, which may be considered a broader evaluation of the president, Ma - Ying jeou.
Mr. President Ma itself is a member of the feelings which, to the mainland predominate, and they have a strong support in the business relations, including the agreement on the part of free trade, in the largest settlement of relations with China from 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning the three of the five offices of the mayor, could not win a majority of the votes.
In addition, the democratic Progressive Party, democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is tilted greater independence of Taiwan, gained almost 50% of the vote against the 45% of the KMT.
If it was on the presidential elections, should President Ma problem.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of the votes of his party, reduced by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the page was the DPP, together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election took place as most of Taiwan's elections, which include noisy electoral trucks and mass rallies with the flags shall be dimly laboring girls.
Part of it was even mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son Lien Chan, an honorary chairman of the KMT was stumping for candidates KMT on the eve of the election.
The man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien purely across his face, hurt him and killed the viewer.
Bizarrely was addressed to the, whether he admitted grudgingly intends to hurt Mr Liena or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing - - Wen, an leading the DPP, says that the shooting the elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads to voters toward the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how remained in the background of the question of the mainland.
Instead, the candidates, of course about plans to state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan's usually used their de facto independence and hates military threats of China.
The KMT has therefore tend to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP dropped also from vzbuzování anti - chinese positions.
It's reaction to the fact and awareness that China' s trade is of crucial importance for economic survival Taiwan.
Mr. President Ma for his party, confirmed that China's policy is for the majority of Taiwan acceptable.
From the government in Beijing can be expected, that it will continue to continue in the commercial bribes, together with its strategy to Taiwan lured back to the herd.
China wasted no time in sending the negotiator to Taipeje, to get the summit of investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It would be better to wait until after the presidential election in 2012.
The Party of the DPP in any case appeared itself.
Two years ago, it was on the wrong level: its former leader, Chen Shui - bian, were sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000 - 08 was a troublemaker and an obvious independence.
But, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai has developed a new generation, which is a moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was provolávána as the DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng - changem, which he was under Mr. Chen.
Their party now all showed that may also cooperate with the Beijing.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, under the assumption that their negotiations may take place without the previous conditions.
Mrs Tsai to Taiwan's public, that her party represents a ``credible alternative," to access of Mr Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the candidates DPP would be better off if insisted that Taiwan's individual countries.
Even ordered Mr. Su, pragmatikovi, to run for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr. Chen will be the DPP to fight for the choice between the potential candidates.
The KMT is authorized to search for their own people.
Evaluation of Mr Ma were bad, and despite breakneck economic growth; candidates KMT with him to go to the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the growing divide between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says that přeorganizuje his cabinet, as well as the local branch.
Strongly advocated by proposals to support the Taiwan for a rapprochement are limited.
At the same time, it is considered to be the most of Taiwan's citizens of the economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chianga, prominent publicist, ``point, from which there is no return, has passed."

Microbes with resistance to arsenic increases the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of the strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of their nutrients, extends the scope for the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth, and argue that this is a sign that life has options, which stood outside the main elements, which have been considered to be essential.
``This organism is twofold ability."
``It may grow, either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
``This is a very special, but it's not proof that there is some form of actually' extraterrestrial life '," commented this fact Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co - author of the message that appeared in Thursday in online magazine Science.
For a long time, it was deemed necessary for the life of the six of the main elements of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria, discovered in mono Lake in California, they are able to continue in the growth, after the for arsenic will replace the phosphorus.
``You wonder what all is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co - author of the message.
This finding is important for the search for life outside the country, because researchers must be able to detect life and you know how life may look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
Nevertheless, the report on this innovation published to discuss, which betrayed the details of the ruling, provoked widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not so.
The discovery of the ``shows that other planetary organisms may be able to take advantage of the other elements, which are fueling biochemistry and that a set of elements, which are considered 'standard', may be for life so absolutely necessary," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, the Open University, in Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
``This work is unusual, because it shows the replacement of one element of other in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," he added Cockell.
It was not accidental discovery.
Felisa wolf - Simon from Astrobiologického Institute in NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake, because a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, therefore, that the microbe, which shall be issued by the two elements, may be able to replace the one for the second.
````Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to the phosphorus."
``The result is that the organisms may very hard to these elements separated."
``However, arsenic is so different that, as Phosphorus does not work if they get into the organism, starts to work in the biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collected bacteria, known as GFAJ - 1, and subjecting them growing arsenic concentration, which are bacteria able to adapt and growth.
Microbes grow better when the phosphorus, but whereas can survive also with refund arzenem, increases the possibility that, in the form of life, which makes use of arsenic, may occur naturally, and it either elsewhere on the ground, or on another planet, or a month, where is arsenic more common.
Jamie S. Foster, lecturer microbiology at the University of Florida, he said, that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by the phosphorus, it is not new, but never found example, on which this fact.
Arsenic was common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists have speculated that it could benefit from the earlier forms of life.
``This suggests that could be different ways, how to create a life, not only in a manner, which was created in the early period of the country," said Foster, which was part of the research team wolf - Simon.
Research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health

This August, was the President Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Director General Enron and an expert on turnover, known to his work for a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts Moelise and Cooper to resolve the financial trouble MGM and 140 creditors study took longer than expected.

Technological toys, to keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate of this year's greatest toy iPad, followed by videoherní system in both cases, but it is a significant interference in the budget for the gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPadu you can buy five BMX bicycles for 99 dollars and one game Kinect stands as much as 10 bead švihadel or approximately 48 cups Play - Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for the gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailer - Wal - Mart, Toys' R 'Us and BJ' s wholesale bank Club - and watched the toys can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately obvious that works Moore's law; this year' s technological toys are far more energy, and at the same prices, if not slightly lower, in comparison with the past years.
While there was a relatively less new toys with affiliated sites, two of the most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club" , offers more.
The increasing number of toys with knoflíkovými batteries, as well as toys with batteries nabíjecími.
Here are some of the recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys ``r" , except in the cases, which are marked otherwise.)
Sing - and - Ma - jigs (Mattel, 13, from $3 years) are stuffed animals, which, when they press tummy.
In one pressing issue a pet tone and the second grip begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, will be singing together and harmoniously.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can not stop.
The best option in a combination of a song and dance is the Star Mickey (Fisher - Price, 60, from $2 years)
Last year i am Elmo Live Technology lent 14 a one - inch animatrickou doll, who can play a game Simon says, and the monthly walking, thanks to its innovative foldable leg with the locking wheel.
Children tested toy Mickey dance instructor, although their parents complain about the lack of the volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980's, you may recall the Alphie, one of the first computer training of toys.
He's back, (Hasbro / Playskool units, $40, for children from 3 years), with the backpack full kvízových cards, which are designed to drive into a fun with work samoopravným, was the workbook.
If a leer after smartphonu for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) regards the cheapest option with a simple using, with QWERTY keyboard, although games have so effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of a series of Leapster from Leapfrog, with newer and a clearer display.
No version is not compatible with older units.
IXL from Fisher - Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years), the system uses iTunes - like to the introduction of the games and e - books and has a slot at SD card, which allows you to show the family photographs.
And, finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five blocks, which are not greater than a box of matches, each of them has led display.
The aim is to create the words of placing the dice into a series of before it expires time; it is great for competition in the form of words.
Still more toys has at least some kind of online concentration.
In the highest degree were in the toy stores two toys Webkinz and Club" .
If you want to your child to buy online toy from Club" , you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" mix 'n Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains the coin with hidden code.
When activating the code online, your child receives enough credit in the store Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include must roller - skates or animal Puffle.
A little more than is štětinka your the tooth brush is Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest in a series of mikrorobotů to knoflíkovou battery.
The beetle was moving quickly to 12 vibrating silicone feet in a random direction.
It's funny if you make a maze of dice and watching, whether he will be able to find a way out.
It is also very persistent.
Our was able to fall with a kitchen table and even to spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of a police checks in China
As the city military instructor, Tang Shenbin after the square, strictly controlled his orders, and giving orders in with military authority.
He wanted to the female member of - China's powerful vymahatelky urban right, the dreaded and despised for their crackdowns and taste for violence - give the impression of a group of the crowd.
``Stand up straight!"
``Hurry!"
Show them whispering quietly, ``how they look pretty girls!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers up to attention.
Four pairs of black boots are listed as a ruler.
Four headgear perfectly sitting on her hair, which are perfectly tied a blue and white ribbons.
``I think that they are, on average," said disdainfully Mr Tang.
````Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the urban Peacekeeper in China.
One city ordered to new recruits had higher education.
'S Guangdong province changed Sedo - green uniforms for allegedly attractive the blue.
Wuhan in Central China substituting eying for a strong armament: in the year 2009 was in one report stated that the 50 officers were surrounded by relentlessly cart lunches and stared at the owner, when the door - to - door seller after half an hour packed and left.
Xindu, urban district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu for the image of the chosen operation.
From the year 2003 district complete its the municipal police about 13 of women, which have been selected specifically, according to his appearance, symmetry, and a young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the gross page police softer, too, a woman's side.
Unfortunately, even the Natasa Solak should trouble to get into the secret of China's urban groups.
They argued critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, the police only allowed to promote the bill, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the chinese media commonly recognised different reality.
In January 2008 police inspectors from Hubei Province was clubbed the to death after used his cell phone to work, as they do in surgery in the matter of protest against the landfill.
In the last year was training policemen in Beijing, manual to this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. in the manual was, inter alia, a description of how effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year's got a duffer with melons in Shanghai into a fight with five police officers and suffered injury to the left of the part of the brain.
One video game of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows the chinese policemen, as the attack on the street vendors.
````Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, national issue, said in the last year, after a further discussion about tactics.
On paper was ``very thoroughly unclog."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After that, what district advertised in October, the interest of the eight new women's officers, an editorial the Beijing Evening News addressing the question of whether women have a real obligations or are only one.
The answer seems to be of both.
District demanded a female candidates in the age of 18 to 22 years with a good character and ``five features in the right proportion."
Adeptky should have the height of higher than the average - thus higher than 1,6 feet.
Pasture at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials argue that the work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
``Their image is the most important thing," said one an unnamed policeman on Rednet. com, as if the government's website.
``The nominees must demonstrate external quality which, then the other, among them, height, weight, features, etc."
Then comes at a series of nature and ``internal quality" .
Women are like flower vases, he said, and added, ``besides, that will be the vases, will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the leadership of the county - town, with this description of power does not agree.
But pointed out that the requirements of the portrait are in China's normal also for other posts, and it in both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical features.
Which means that the question of good appearance is between the Chinese the subject of discussions.
Handicapped or mutilation is certainly not apply.
``Can not admit to us served lame or hunchbacked man," said Mr. Zheng.
``His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, which holds a watch on the square Baoguang in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces like apples and gently shaped mouth.

Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensigna
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared of Senator John Ensigna from criminal charge, which covered his affair with a former advisor for the campaign and its efforts to ensure the lobby, announced in the center of the senator lawyers.
The decision of the end of the most serious legal threat, which Mr. does, Nevada Republican, faced and who was, until the scandal, is considered a potential republican candidate for president for the year 2012. his affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
The Office of Mr Ensigna said that he was a decision that followed almost after the investigation, ````certainly pleased" .
Senator could still face a disciplinary proceedings in the Senate Ethics Committee.
Lawyers Mr Ensigna said that the Ministry of Justice, ``us informed that Senator does not will no longer be the objective of the investigation and that it is not in the plan float against him another charge in this matter."
The Justice Department to the case has declined to comment.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who argued that there are compelling evidence that Mr. does not preparing a breach of the prohibition of the federal lobbying.
The talks, e - mails, and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. does not helped Douglasu Hamptonovi, one of his assistants, to ensure a lucrative lobbies, which should lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. keeping your secrets once worked as cashier in the campaign Ensigna.
Mr. does not contacted a series of political supporters, to find work for Mr. Hampton and promote their views, after Mr. Hampton work to lobbying, so the documents, and the talks.
Since he was Hampton until recently, the assistant Mr Ensigna, from the law of lobbying of his former employer or Chamber of the year.
Experts on the ethics of claims that unusual settlement of Mr Ensigna and Mr. Hampton, who were in front of the affair friends, appeared in conflict with the ban lobbying.
From the evidence, which were published a ``, it became clear that it is a clear case of violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, Washington lawyer, who specializes in defense of clients, who are investigating the Government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Case Senator Ensigna, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing on Ethics said that the Ministry's cautious, as regards the political actions, after a large number of failures, including the decision of the last year, suspend proceedings against the former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of misconduct prosecution.
The federal prosecutors ``clearly hid weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization of the citizens of responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D. C., (Citizens for social and Ethics in Washington), the law firm group, which was lodged in the case of several complaints against Mr. Ensignovi.
````Shows that in fact that the senior government officials with the laws apply," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer Mr Ensigna, in an interview told him on Monday called state representative of the Ministry of Justice and subsequently, then the next day, and told him that the Ministry of found against his client no charges.
Defense team of Mr Ensigna cooperates with the applicants in an effort to convince them that Senator, as his office repeated in Wednesday's statement, ``acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments, which the government representatives.
``I am not comfortable about the details of my discussions with the Ministry of justice, in addition to think that made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided on the closing of the investigation with a separate complaint, in which the ethical group filed charges, that the payment of parents Ensigna hamptons of 96,000 $violated federal election law.
The election, the Commission noted that did not have enough evidence to show that the money meant nothing else than the gift.
One company, for which Mr. does not helped Mr. Hamptonovi find lobbying work, the company was NV Energy, the main Nevada, the company that long Senator support.
One e - mail from December 2008 demonstrated that, after began to Mr. Hampton in the company to act as a ``lobbyist, chief of staff of Mr Ensigna - John Lopez - interact with Mr. Hamptonem and told him that ````"'to the Ministry of Interior regarding the disputed subject.
Mr. does not also participated in the lunch with Mr. Hamptonem and other nevadským client, Allegiant Air and said Transport Minister to arranged a meeting on behalf of the airline, after the hire Mr. Hampton lobbying to work.
When the last year, for the first time, a report on the affair, Mr. does not apologize to their voters and resigned, as in the order of the fourth republican leaders in the Senate.
After the director of stagnation of Mr. does the two weeks before he told reporters, that is planned to participate in the third term in the Senate.
In the report, that Mr. does is no longer the aim of criminal investigation his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said that Senator hopes that the Ethics Committee will quickly followed by the Ministry of Justice and end the investigation.
````Senator does not look forward to continue its hard work in the name of Nevada, people," she said.
The challenge of Cheshire turns on Twitter
In the courtroom half a dozen.
The minute by minute sending messages of horrendous testimony over Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that, more than 140 000 reports on Twitter addressed the rape and přivazováním children to their beds in the house, which was kindled.
Thursday held trial Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted for the killing of three of the citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and should be held official end with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But lawyers, Mr. Reuben Hayes already court filed an appeal with applications and arguments, which would court is likely to be employed years.
One of the nejprovokativnějších is that the intensive reporting process - including the widespread use of Twitter the main reporters - create ``a circus atmosphere" and this enlarged, the immediate penetration of information with pobuřujícími details then adopted a jury in a decision within the meaning of the influence of the public opinion.
This claim could make the judge to address the question of whether, with the emergence of new technologies that the new rules in the courtroom.
``How i have seen in this trial, i think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of due process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the attorney, Mr. Reuben Hayes.
The judge of the process Jon C. Blue Supreme Court State briefly refused to claim concerning the yield from last week, and with it, that the media were ``carefully controlled," and that there is no evidence to suggest that the jury has acted under the influence of the public.
But it is probably the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts recognized that the news of the notoriously known cases may cause questions about justice process.
In the regulation of 1966 the United States Supreme Court annulled condemnation though chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in its decision, he said that, in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, is in the process of reason, the media were ``party atmosphere" .
Some are convinced that this offence has been an inspiration tv show, and the movie ``fugitive" .
Some of the lawyers say that appeals courts, which was reviewed Hayesův judgment about half a century later, could be surprised argument that might be necessary new rules governing the method of communication in the direction of the court, which was, in the case of Dr. Sheppard inconceivable.
``There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the cases, said John J. Donohue III, Professor of Law, Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut, and wrote a report, which said that it was exercised.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be pleased with the idea that the restrictions on the communication from the court may make the process.
Case Twitter is only one of the many outlined lawyers Mr. Reuben Hayes, who would be able to argue for years, in order to comply with the judgment.
Defenders of also, for example, argues that, in the case of Mr. Reuben Hayes may go about bias, when the judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors them in the selection of the jury will prove criminal photographs of an awe - inspiring.
Some of the judges said that they were aghast photographs of the victims, which became Jennifer Hawke - Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates argue that also refuse to abandon constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly called the judge, who was critical of national representatives and that its Decision incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and routed the jury to this weekend thinking.
The judges were separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
In opposition against the verdict made last month, that the case dominated reports in Connecticut, and was discussed during the election campaign candidates for the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly flames of emotion in this case.
``The daily of media, the cameras and reporters before the court wrote, ``the lawyer, ``it was something here in New Haven, has not yet been to see, and it's also possible on national, a rarity."
Their focus on the impact of Twitter's controversial.
In his talks some journalists argued that the immediate reporting more outrageous, than the reports referred to later and, from their point of view should the police to manage the scope of the other processes.
But some doctors and lawyers demanded appeals courts with the arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Lawyers, Mr. Reuben Hayes, seek to this right.
In its archives referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 in the matter of the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process, and to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
``This case," wrote, ``a case Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21 st century."
May politeness to overcome the gap?
After the campaign, which was a remarkable its hurtful and negativismem, this week in Washington, D. C., a small quantity of politeness.
It's the first swallow real cooperation two political parties or only iluzivní moment before the rapid return to the party' s struggle in the capital city?
Tuesday's agenda of President Obama' s and the parliamentary leaders have no fundamental discoveries on the crucial issues, which must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a lively discussion about the opinion differences in the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode Party's competition.
Wednesday public meetings of the President's deficit, the Commission was also a civilized, and despite the political differences between members of the remain.
It seems that it is clear that close synergies for several months, built of mutual respect, which exceeds the ideological divide, which members still divides.
And it is very difficult to argue that started a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in a trial period - sondují each other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience vis - à - vis the renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also Tuesday's negotiations and his later evaluation of the participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep for it to be proposed by the rapid change, which here are the last two years.
Whatever's going on the question of taxes, expenditure, health care or rights, the two parties are miles away.
Nevertheless, the elections to Washington, at least, quickly.
``The question is not whether changed regulatory issues," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now in the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
``You are after the election, the inevitable.
The election had roused emotions party and then fell silent.
That's good."
In a number of issues, in particular those to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year, has expired and no one, it is not considered to be favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, and it permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, as likely to compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans can not look at it, how supported the tax cuts for the rich, while the unemployed, refuse to support in unemployment.
After Tuesday's agenda in the White House is to see greater optimism about possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening of the Treaty.
But William Galston from the Brookings Institution points out that a successful cooperation on the fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship, the two of political parties, when the 112. Congress convened in January.
Rather, it is likely the period of discord, or even the inevitable, he said.
``After what to do things that must be done, Psychology in the short term returns to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely expanded - that politeness to lead is real cooperation.
``I am looking at all events, between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main event arise in 2012," he said.
The reasons, to a large extent linked to the establishment of a new Republican majority in the White House and voters tea parties, who helped create.
Republican leaders now stands before the dangers of exaggeration, knowing that they must behave according to their promises, and must reduce spending, the government and cancel the new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the early 'responses to the recommendations of the deficit, which include a reform of the tax code and an increase in some taxes, raising the retirement age and a reduction of the expenditure.
The Joint Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, D. C., and they have, according to his opinion, pressure questions of the deficit to the public programme in ways that can not be ignored.
They need but 14 votes in 18 member of the Commission, to its plan to introduce a formal recommendations and fought, therefore, that is to this number as possible.
The largest opposition is between elected officials in the jury, who claim that, in the case of the financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first starts next year, in the form of a party of conflict, when the Republicans invited Obama to the solution of the budget, taxes and health care, when a period, the greater the party's cooperation.
What will shift?
Public opinion.
There are plenty of evidence that, despite stranickosti in the last election, most Americans wants to continue to see the two parties, which working together.
If you could be directed to a stalemate, as it was in the year 1995, then, both parties will be very carefully monitor the public reaction.
Anyone would risk reduction of votes, change is likely course and will be the search for a compromise.
It may be optimistic view of things.
Partisanship and guidelines are more today than it was in the mid - 1990's, it appears that a greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans, than was the case in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, the activists on both sides of the sees the year 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, this week, would prefer many Americans.
It will be a state, but many efforts on both sides to find common bases in issues, which is still divide.
Vyzrazený american document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the ``kleptocracies" and the continues parts of bribes and bribes, which is the way to Kremlinu turned the american embassy in Russia in the records of February.
The police, and the Federal security service, to a large extent, holding the protective wings, which help to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
Choose the money not only from the legal business but also from organised crime groups.
Each layer bureaucracy - which, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called ``vertikála Office" - take their, the money will begin to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington, D. C., under the name of ambasadora John Beyrleho, was in the middle of the public through WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the resources, whose name was redigována.
The record was written in a time when he was still mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of large a share of the corruption.
It has been revoked in October, president of Dvořák Medvedevem, but since we can track only minimal changes in the purification.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, which owns a prominent design firm, after many years constantly denied charges of corruption, and won several actions for false charges for such allegations.
In September, said on Russia's tv station, when he was asked by the testimony of corruption: ``it' s crazy, if it's dirty, it' s shit."
The Russians with absolute conviction, he believes that if their company corrupt, it turns out that the vote.
It is, of course, an unusual meeting with such details vyřčenými in such a manner, and it in ambasádní report, and it is also unheard of, that would do so diplomats from foreign countries.
``The government of the town of Moscow and its links with the criminal element of some led to called her 'dysfunctional,' and confirmed that the government is more like kleptocracies than as a government," says the report.
````Criminal elements have benefited from the so - called 'krysha' (the term of the world and the mafia, literally means' top 'or protection), provided by the police, of the Federal Security Service, of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the state of the representative, as well as everywhere in government bureaucracy, the city of Moscow.
````Analysts identified and třístupňovou structure in criminal world of Moscow."
````Luzhkov's at the top."
``The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and militias are on the second stage."
``And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals, and corrupt inspectors."
``It is ineffective system, in which the criminal groups, filling the gaps in some areas, as the city of some of the services provided."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest companies, and the police focuses on smaller enterprises.
One source said, ``the owners of the shops in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or of the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organised crime groups), as they do not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but also are protected by the law."
``For this reason already protection from criminal gangs is not so in the rate."
Recording says that, while the selection of the money is a comprehensive, protecting itself may already have trouble; and those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who are not fast enough, their business under various pretexts closing.
Medvedev several times, he spoke of the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he did not only a little progress.
Ambasádní report speaks about men last cases, probably bulging with cash, to the Kremlinu.
``In its fight against corruption must be Medvedev rely on bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's research team of Indem.
``It is but a part of this bureaucracy."
``It is not part of the country's political class, because in Russia' s political class already exist."
Without the politicians, without the opposition, without the distribution of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem, estimates that the nationally is corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country's ranks 154. place in a recent survey about global perception of corruption, a non - governmental organisation Transparency International (countries are sorted from at least after the most corrupt).
The discovery of the message of the american embassy in Moscow in the late evening, i am sure has caused by the russian government enthusiasm, though only to the extent that for Moscow's shortcomings may be indicted Luzhkov, it may be for the Kremlin to argue in the matter of the solution to the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry King told Putin, that the documents, which WikiLeaks, could be counterfeit and responded angrily to the declaration that american diplomats called Batman and Robin Medvedeva.
``The truth of the matter is that it's about our mutual synergies, which is an important factor in the domestic policy in this country," he said.
``But to be honest, we did not think it will be carried out with such arrogance, with such duress, you understand, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to come to terms with the past
In the dimly lighted concrete classroom with zašpiněnými and oloupanými walls reminded the Director of the school Anlong Veng High School of a man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge the fluid.
``We all love the Mocha."
``It was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng KOR Ma, 42.
Known as ``the butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge, remains commander in this remote estate Khmer Rouge in the northwest Cambodia popular, where he built the hospital, bridges, and other infrastructure, and where is still alive thousands of former soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge gave up government's busted prolonged loyalty is also in Anlong Vengu.
In April were victims at the Forum truth and reconciliation to publicly to confront with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government has provided textbooks, which for the first time, the children to explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, raise together the UN and Cambodia's court first conviction of the former member of the Khmer Rouge, the judgment of the former leader, the notoriously famous thuggish associations Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as a ghost, 35 years in prison.
With each progress, increasing restlessness between veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts of reconciliation and their attempts to engage in Cambodia's company.
````Between the former Khmer Rouge's hatred and fear, but they are helpless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the documentation centre Cambodia, an independent organization, which explores the regime.
``For them, life was between the Khmer Rouge lovely, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
````Divides the family."
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, since 1975 in 1979, was estimated 1,7 million people executed or starved to death, to the illness or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew the government, Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its soldiers fled to the cambodian border with Thailand.
There was a rebellion, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guided the guerrilla war of their bases in the mountains and the jungles in Western Cambodia, while the fluid cultivated supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid - 1990's, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. large groups of the warriors of the Khmer Rouge began to pace to the government, which culminated in the surrender Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and the fluid, which persisted, was in 1999, was captured by the government forces in the mountains nedalých Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penhském prison in 2006, while waiting for the process.
Their patrons of them nepečovali, most of the former combatants Khmer Rouge sunk to ordinary Cambodia's rural life, and many of them nostalgically recalled for a period of movement.
Although several elite of the Khmer Rouge maintain its local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
``These people from the surrender of a minimum of," said rival Leang from the Center for Justice and reconciliation, which leads to the public forums throughout the Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
``They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology mode."
``They were manners without any ideas about the implementation of the trade."
SOR Lim, 55, which came to the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settled as poor farmer in 1998.
``Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
``The fluid all living."
``But now is hard life, because all we must ensure themselves."
The court of the Khmer Rouge also raised concerns.
At the beginning of the next year will begin to court to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court's mandate prosecute the principal přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but it was not speaking, whether it will continue also in the four cases.
It was just a little to reassure concerns in Anlong Vengu.
The recent speculation media focusing on the IM Chaema, 64, which was a district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge at the end of the 1970's.
In 2007, said researchers from the documentation centre in Cambodia, that to supervise the construction of dams Trapeang Thma, project, which probably killed thousands of compulsory workers.
The recent upon the evening, the IM Chae returned from work in the field to his wooden cottage on a dirty way out of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and there were shadows across the parched grass, IM Chae refused to speak about his past between the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called refused to go.
``In Cambodia, peace and is stable," she said.
``If they appear further prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, that ran from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also has repeatedly warned that occurs to instability, if the court to search for more suspects, although with the experts and historians disagree.
````Cambodia must dig deep hole and bury it in the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what it must Cambodia do to move forward, said Youk Chhang from the documentation centre.
``The reconciliation in khmerským emoluments means cobble together the broken pieces," he said.
``It is our duty to give these broken pieces together, to understand."
Center has made the first book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 parties and the name of ``the history of democratic Cambodia."
She was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June, in addition to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, also the young people in Anlong Vengu only few details on the Khmer Rouge, despite the concentration of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng said that the new textbooks helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents have responded skeptical, when he took home book to study.
``My family refuses to many parts of the books and the courts," he said.
``Are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be court to prosecute."
Such a resistance is reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said rival Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to affect, told the further.
The Khmer Rouge here are still strong spell.
Up in the mountains Dangrek Mountains' s path overgrown with weeds and square odhozenými plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
The body Pol Pot here has been burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, the salesgirl mobilů on the side of the road, said that he did not know much about the man who was in that place ashed.
``But it has a strong spirit, many of the local people here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea should's birthday, and should plan in later to visit the place of rest Pol Pot, where it will bring the volume of ripe bananas, in the hope that it will bring you luck.
Belarus, agrees that seems to their weapons stocks on the basis of uranium
In surprise victory in the campaign President Obama's on ensuring nuclear material throughout the world, announced Belarus government in the center, abandoning their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security of the summit Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynovem.
The US government for years trying to convince Belarus, in order to surrender of highly enriched uranium, and seemed to the stumbled last spring.
But the US officials said the Washington Post, that in the last two months, it was with Belarus carried out a couple of classified operations to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons on the basis of uranium from the research facility.
You have paved the way for the Wednesday agreement to the removal of the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to an official, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive issue.
The agreement has proven to be one of the most important of the results of the Obama 47. national summit on nuclear safety in April, on which was Belarus discarded.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former soviet republics to the subsequent summit in 2012.
``I am really fascinated by the fact that they want to place at the summit on nuclear safety 2012."
``It proves that process works," Ken said Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, support groups nuclear safety.
Clinton called agreement as ``very important, an important step" from Belarus.
Obama has promised in Prague in April 2009, to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world to four years.
Since then, the US government has helped the six countries get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
A dozen countries do so for the management of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear safety announced Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, that his people will never give up its uranium.
``We are highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds of what is essentially the basis for the gun and less enriched uranium," he said then Lukashenko.
``It's our commodity. do not intend to produce dirty bomb, and it is also not anyone to sell."
``We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, a few months ago acceded to the United States and made clear interest to reach an agreement.
The first commitment to delete Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly by, officials announced.
He was loaded onto the special train, who toured more than 1 300 miles into Russia's device for the storage and disposal, officials said.
Second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government for the programme spent 13 million dollars, most of it to the supply of the Research Institute less enriched uranium, for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
``It was all zkoordinováno very carefully and managed on the basis of confidence" , which led to the agreement signed by the Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working for the Global Threat Reduction effort.
James Martin Center for the study of the Non - Proliferation Treaty this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable to the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to eliminate their stocks until 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been over the years, tense, primarily because of Lukašenkově cruel repression of human rights.
But the Wednesday declaration suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
``We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States, and Belarus acknowledge that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis of the improved relations, and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The spanish government did not with the CIA trouble
The spanish government did not hesitate to flights carrying the CIA landlocked talibance and members of Al - Qaida in Guantánamo through the spanish territory, as he put it in his telegram the United States Minister in Madrid.

De la Vegová stressed that Spain does not have a problem with the years ago the intelligence services through their territory.
````Simply just want to be informed" , ``reached unprepared," says Aguirre in one of the documents.
Also, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos suggested, the american ambassador, that the spanish government ``wanted to give this matter as low as possible, but that this thing was in the hands of judges, the limited influence."
In February 2007, the procurator Vicente Gonzalez told the embassy, that if his concerns, it does not intend to block the initiative Judge ask for the declassification of documents of the National Center secret services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense concerning flights of the CIA.
``Such information, do not contain any of the folder or no sensitive information," explained embassy after the interview with the D. a.
Nevertheless, the US expressed concerns rather for" obvious coordination between the spanish judge and german prosecutors" than for the declassification information CNI or the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to solve this case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch, of the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior Alfred Péreze Rubalcaby, told the ambassador, that ``there are spanish judge very jealous on its independence and do what will be considered appropriate" , entered the already instructions his colleagues, ``to avoid rozohněným discussion with the intention to reduce tensions."
Ambassador also expresses its concern on the agenda of political parties Partido Popular (PA; czech People's Party - attractive.) in this matter.
``Despite its general pro - american orientation of our experience, he says that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to use any indication that Zapaterova government tolerated or deliberately ignored the negotiations with the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and even in the case, that these revelations could have negative consequences for the government of the United States," he says.

KDU - ČSL members would gain in the House of Commons 4 chair and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia - attractive.) would have lost 9 mandates
With the results of 28 November the PP could have a major word on radnicích in Léridě, Tarragoně and Barcelona.
After a significant increase of their votes, and the number of members of experienced during the recent autonomous elections, katalánská PP (People's Party of Catalonia - attractive.), already has the idea of general elections, whatever the increase in or not, its prospects are more than a positive, since the number of votes in nationwide elections is usually once such a vote against catalonian.
In the year 2008 gained katalánští KDU - ČSL members in the general election 610.473 voices, while in the election of autonomous from the year 2006 was this number only 316.222.
Last Sunday gained PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) 384.091 voice.
If this tendency increases, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of voters PA, analysts of this party calculated that if they are going to be a general elections, PPC could in the House to obtain 12 members, compared to the current 8, the Party CiU (Convergencia even Unió, czech agreement, and the Union - attractive.) would have also 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would have lost, at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia has for parties and PSOE (the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) of vital importance.
According to this analysis of the Christian the ERC (left - wing Republican Party of Catalonia - attractive.) lost one of a Member of - now has a 3 - while ILE (Green initiative for Catalonia - attractive.) should continue to one mandate, where appropriate, would have one another.
However, according to the electoral calendar is the nearest the held in May 2011, on the occasion of the municipal elections, where it would also be able to KDU - ČSL members decisive influence at the end of the domination of the Socialists in four main provincial cities, and also to changes in the Council of the Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget plans - 661 million euro for the year 2011.
Both nationalists and KDU - ČSL members agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragoně, Léridě and Geroně, where the Socialists have received a majority and even they could turn to its traditional allies, the parties of the ERC and ILE.
Whereas the debacle Republicans would be impossible, if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona once - as it is necessary to obtain a minimum of 5% of the vote.
The Party PA has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Léridě and Tarragoně.
Nationalists are convinced that could play a major role in turnover in Tarragoně, where ruled jointly with the Party PP before the current mayor, Josepem Félixem Ballesterosem.
In Léridě gained PP only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relations with Marianem Rajoyem - during the last campaign on several occasions met.
KDU - ČSL members have also on the other major radnicích as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
At present, PP representation at 34 radnicích in Catalonia and would create a candidate in the best possible communities.
Katalánská cell provided the organization of Al - Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven of detainees in Barcelona, were arrested three more in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis, and one Nigerijec, who were arrested agents of the General Information station in Barcelona, was the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, who arranges for passports of different groups of Al - Qaeda, among whom were also ``Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam" or ``Lashkar - e - Taiba," while the latter group was the author of assassinations in Mumbai, in which in 2008 106 died persons.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches investigation of this matter of great importance, seeks to ensure that they are using the ``Operation Kampai" weakening padělatelského apparatus Al - Qaeda at the international level, and ``limit its operational capabilities."
Investigators estimated that this cell might during the two years ago, when it was in Catalonia active, send thousands of passports to Thailand, where then have been counterfeited, and then shipped groups, which constitute a criminal organisation of the galaxy Al - Qaeda, to their ``fighters" could with impunity to travel across the border in Europe and other western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active, which should have a network of jihad in Europe, and it is therefore these investigations, in addition to the Thai services also participated in other european police units, and therefore, it can not be excluded that, in the days following the event in other european countries to a similar interference, like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In the context of this operation (when they were arrested Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand developed further, in which they were captured by the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men, who was driving from Bangkok cell based in Spain and the other in other european countries.
Katalánská network, has been destroyed in 2009, pillage, in particular, tourists passports which comply with the requirements of islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to the men aged 25 to 45 years, had to have a force for several years and be without the visa.
In the investigative documents, it is emphasised that are not yet known any facts which combines withheld from Catalonia with the assassination in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, ``Lashkar - e - Taiba" should be one of the groups, which received stolen passports in Spain, and then falsifikované in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination was dispatched from Catalonia conversion agency about a thousand dollars, which were ``inserted" for the purchase of cards in mobile phones, which later used were members of the ``a" that killed 106 people.
The police have already foreclosed on many of the evidence.

The Director of the geriatric device assures that the deaths occurred in the ``shortage of measures"
The performance of the center Olot do not exclude that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The leadership of the geriatric Centre de la Caritat Olot (Gerona) provided yesterday press conference to vylíčilo, what damage caused the institution of the criminal behavior Joan villa Dilmé, orderly, which - while here, he was employed - killed at least eleven of elderly people, which had in the care.
The director of this home for the elderly, Joan Sala was accompanied by a lawyer device, an attorney Joan Canada, and announced that ``the wishes of the Czech Republic la Caritat would be able to press charges against the culprit" responsible for killing, but ``the legality and responsibility for us to leave this process of the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the good name, which may this institution suffer because of it, in a timely manner revealed of criminal activities orderly, a major threat to the home of la Caritat represent now requirements for material compensation, which has already been calculated the legal representatives of the bereaved families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already in August 2009 and that from this time to kill
The judge ordered the exhumation eight bodies clients home for the elderly with suspicion that, in many cases, at the deceased no doctor personally, but that - whereas age and ill health status of patients, everything vyřizovalo over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through his manager resolutely refused to this extreme and pointed out that ``the lack of measures could not be in any case, the cause of it," .
Legal representative la Caritat added, ``in the case, there are no indications that would, in addition to its own accused of any third person committed misconduct."
The man dubbed ``the angel of death," said yesterday 11, killing and clarified that the first crime committed 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed the old lady.
In this case, caused the death of the too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case, when used a combination of tranquillising pills.
The Director la Caritat to said that it is complicated to control the approach of the staff to medikamentům.
Insulin and cocktail medication may have been in six cases of nine means that this caregiver used to patients killed in its attempt to relieve them from suffering.
But it was only analysis, which now underway in the laboratory, should show whether Vila does not lie and actually looking for its first victim less cruel death or, on the other hand, is killed the liquor, as already admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In a la Caritat believe zdravotníkovým claims and neither do not exclude that the number of deaths may be higher than what he confessed, and justify their behavior in the different versions of a villa court with the knowledge that they must change their negotiations, when it became clear that killed eight people.
That's why they say that they want to be the judiciary available, that was illuminated by the whole range of this matter.
The European Central Bank threatens to
Investors yesterday sharply reacted to yesterday's threat of the president of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who said that ``markets should not be underestimated our ability to respond."
Peripheral diferenciály closed the strength and the European Bank shares fell by more than 5%.
However, should also be underestimated the ability of the European Central Bank shall be mistaken - the euro has just gone over the critical value.
I did yesterday, is typical for illiquid market, which, though the downturn, is recovering - but the short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose concerns.
A month before us, the European Central Bank cited to reclaim the degree of liquidity, and tomorrow i will have to be for the fourth time during the two years of appeal.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the redemption of the public debt for the inefficiency and eliminate all exceptional rates of liquidity in the time limit and keep unrestricted access only for a period of one week.
After the crisis, we expect the degree of liquidity forecasts, ``at least until March" and the three - month licitaci with unlimited access to the end of this trimester, in order to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
Also, we hope that they will continue to work in his program buying bonds and that even to notify his intensify.
Are disappointed if created expectations, creates it again reaction of markets from yesterday, and if you will continue to blindly to resume the extent of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the Congress in May, where they argued that, even the thought of buying bonds, and the collapse of the markets - tomorrow might history repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and steadfast.
In May it announced armoured fist on Monday and Wednesday, that they have already bought many, thereby triggering another market collapse.
Yesterday's bidding bills for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5,28%, compared with $750 million with 4.81% from the previous sale.
Thus, therefore, rates in Portugal fell by 30 points lower, odrážejíce so change of mood on the market, which occurred after the words Trichet.
In Ireland was published figures represent the losses Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amount roughly 10.000 million on short - term securities and other potential. 15,000, until February, they have the chance to become a private equity, otherwise they will be zestátněny.
Even though Ireland has no credibility, after in July problem reveal stresses tests, the amounts are in the framework of the auxiliary plan acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the next Tuesday will need the government to obtain the approval of the new budget Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so in Ireland to continue to govern the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel ameliorate the tone of his speech to release the tension in the face for the next meeting of the EU leaders held 14 December, on which it is necessary to lead to a political compromise, which would show that we are, the Union, and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would rather Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain had Prime Minister yesterday, the possibility of presenting action plan, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, the deficit - reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment - to the ears of investors that sounds like four seasons from Vivaldi's.
Double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the stock market has increased by 4,5%, therefore doubly than other european stock exchanges.
Unlike the February was the reaction of the government and the National Bank of rapid and convincing - mining probably from the effect of surprise.
Today here is the key licitaci bond for three years, which will favour PCBS Trichet, which, we hope, will great demand, which will help alleviate the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For the rescue plan would be for Spain self - sacrifice.
He said he'd give us cash, which we do not need - in El Tesoro is available to 40.000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates of and access to markets would be closed the sine die.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue to use this strategy Cesarovy women - ````not only be, but also the zdáti" .
We can do it.

The Red Bull imitates Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvement in vehicles in real time.
Ever since the Red Bull barge in into the Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this exceptional world speed is characterised by surprise and success.
Initially, could not too seriously options for this the newcomer's team, and despite the upward trend of recent, all bets were on the triumph of the Ferrari Fernando Alonsa.
Without reducing riding ability to champion, the Germans Sebastian Vettela, or the possibility of engine Renault, which propels his car, in the world's Formula 1, the legend - ````secret weapon" , which multiethnic Siemens put into the hands of the Red Bullu him to do so the winning team.
In fact, they are on the Executive software which simulates the marches, which the german company said on the market in 2007 for the purposes of the very remote automotive sport.

Its aim is faithfully reproduced product or simulate process sooner than is created, thereby to avoid unnecessary mistakes and spending.
Plm would facilitate the development of the camera CANON, aircraft Sukhoi or the commercial vehicles brand Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, leading industrial division of the company's Siemens, explains that the use of this software instruments to the Red Bull undertake a ``within a few hours, in real time," the modification and improvement, which otherwise would detect during the factories and the tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, employing the stables on average 10 technicians who were able to carry out a maximum of three or four improvement during a period.
In the Red Bull works today to 180 junior high - skilled professionals with executive information technology, who will analyse and propose any type of modification racing cars.
The Head of Siemens explained that the software plm is unable to analyze and improve all elements racing cars Red Bull, with the exception of the engine, which is entirely responsible Renault.
Modify the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
Changes can be converted from the virtual reality, in fact, during the less than 24 hours, thanks to the advanced production systems using laser and high - tech Autoclave.
The only limit of this technical advances is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum, which may each team Formula 1 issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
The Red Bull up roughly 50 km from London race - of - the - art technologies used to design and manufacture of their racing cars.
This is the two buildings, which is limited by the entry visits - especially journalists.

List of interested in this project, 580 persons, including two pilots - champion Vettela and Mark Webber.
A hero of the Red Bullu's Formula 1, without a doubt fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the fathomless technological means that mark the energy of drinks channeled into its participation in racing circuits, but there are other protagonists, whose aid is priceless, and there is no one knows.
The boss of the production technology Steve Nevey argues that five years ago, it was possible to say that the advances in research and development of vehicles to contribute to the victory of 50%, and the rest was the result of the riders.
Currently, the ratio is changed and technology is worth the successes of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, since they are ``unpredictable Gladiators" .

``I believe that most of the merger has already been made, inkorporaci Cajasolu group to the Banca Cívica can not be considered to be the second round, what are the Convention" .
``Most is fully implemented; it's possible that, instead of 17 institutions, we will go to the 13 or 14, but all large processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which in this matter has worked very well," said the Director.
In their declarations on meeting ADEA (Association of leaders and executive officials of Aragon - attractive.) Olavarrieta told that the process of concentration shall be ``maximum speed, and we must be very happy, as shown in instalments, which is our time, not now, appeared in business plans with the spanish National Bank," said.
``Go from 45 thrifts with the average volume of assets. 28 000 million on 17 75.500 million is the process, which is not in the history of the comparison, redukujíce so the number of institutions 62%, that these were larger and thus in accordance with the Basel contract," she stiffed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that ``there are a number of very happy views on the slowness of the process," which show ``lack of respectability and understanding," because ````what he was doing the Spanish National Bank's reminders that we must be before the end of the year in term" .
Director - general CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the most severe financial system in the whole of Europe and the ``probably" in the world, and those that question, to ``a lack of knowledge."
The Director of the said that, when the current favourable economic situation, ``we can be calm" on the financial institutions and savings banks and the system, which i ````very important" concentration process, and which continues, ``the highest possible speed" .
Also reminded that the spanish banking worked very well from the stress tests, carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red line of german
BERLIN decided to maintain the euro, but the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension in the markets of a double the government's response.
On the one hand, suggested José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from the tax cuts for small and medium - sized enterprises, through the regulation of private agencies or repeal 426 euro for the unemployed without benefits, after privatisation 49% AENA (spanish airports and air traffic management, manager of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice - president Elena Salgadová with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe is, on the other hand, joined the critiques of to address Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for the launch of the current crisis.
How to interpret this emotion?
Well in advance that the opinion of Merkel is a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in a complex process redefinitions of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what is to be his future, which is referring to the idea of compliance with the old traditions, which holds a large part of the other members.
In the face of the European resistance in Germany begins to speculate about three ways of the crisis.
The first of them represents the strong euro zone, which would be Germany, but also, for example, Austria, or the Netherlands, while the southern states would monetary zone left.
The second is a return to the mark - although now it may seem like a science - fiction, this version has a broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the german proposals recasting the euro with a larger macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigor of, penalties for the offending states, possible delays payment for some of them, and with the enlargement of the possible costs to control to the private sector.
Germany's position is clear and already had some time defines, so for the runaround now is not the space.
First, when in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission incentivized deficits, pulled from the german government constitutional reform to them from 2016.
This was the first sign of conflict between what it Germany for the correct (plans fiscal stringency of, and the stability of the public finances), and what to its european partners, including France.
The second showed this central european countries, if Merkel painfully stretched out of the decision regarding the rescue of Greece.
It was the subject of a serious criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published were heavily against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last October's days, Merkel again with a clear opinion, when requested to reform the Convention, the European Union so as to allow for the rescue of one of the Member State and at the same time, to the private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti - european, since the accelerated the irish crisis, and everything else.
But its proposal, although in a slightly as mitigated by the form, was approved, and over the next few months, we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should from 2013 to allow these measures.
Germany by the red line, which will not exceed.
And all tells us that, although now needs to be done, which probably too disagrees, from this date, the old functioning of the end of the euro.
Year 2013 will represent the birth of a new Monetary Zone, in which the states of the offending hard sanctioned and may be forced to announce the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also need to bear part of the costs.
Germany us suggests that we must give a strict way growth with increasing the savings and investment, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, was in the years boom of the growth of Spain, simply want to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we will make a mistake, if you understand.
It is not only on the renewal of the public deficits at 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do, it is much harder.
And the worst of it is that, under these conditions could happen to us, they were wrong.
I hope that the current turbulence for greater peace.
And to take advantage of the opportunities, which gives us into the spring 2013.
It seems that the Prime Minister Zapatero, it also understood and his dual declaration (reforms promised after the meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's notification of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel will open the way the idea that it is necessary to give the right thing to do.
But the red line, which Germany set, it is here, and it does not seem to be with her to move.
And from the possibilities, over which can be considered, unable to abandon the euro - zone of a serious countries exclude.
Well, Germany us always will be able to tell us warned.
Sport and circumvention of the rules
Tricks, what do Alonso and Ramos in the struggle with Ajaxem, show the wit not intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly zosnovaná exclusion of two players currency Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the struggle against the Champions League Ajax of 23 November caused, that was launched a sea of ink about whether this is or is not unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether it would eventuelne UEFA had both footballers punish.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game (who had their team clearly vou take), appointed by the players one after the other deliberately wasted time in the moment when should play a foul, so as to provoke the judge, and he showed a second yellow card.
In this way, the both players fulfill the punishment in the struggle against Auxerre - Real Madrid will end in his group in the lead - and will be able to, deprived of the cards, continue on to the next phase.
Finally, the Disciplinary Board UEFA coach José Mourinhovi punishment for two games and leading players got a financial penalty.
The provocation yellow cards under similar conditions is not any new practice, but it is more or less in football, the normal.
It is so widespread, that is part of the ethos of football, i. e., the rules, which are informal, but are watching.
Part of the debate in this case was due to the fact that the participant was team Real Madrid (which, in its national anthem boasts magnanimity and honor, and who has already for similar actions of his players pokutoval), and as it seems, thanks to the drama, led by the Mourinhem, which was added to its long history actor and provocateur another episode.
In any case, the debate about whether this kind of negotiations, which is not the rules expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of the sport, therefore, whether in these deeds circumvention of the law; it is indeed actions respecting sporting rules, whose sense, of course, as it seems, trying to bypass.
Shall be settled, what type of damage such negotiations is a spirit of sport.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical integrity opponents, which was not in these cases violated, or to avoid violent game.
Another one of these formalities characterise the net game is to avoid the players because of his transgression had vis - à - vis the team opponent advantage - which also here.
Thus, the paradox of action players currency Madrid is the fact that it did not happen, what normally charakterizujeme as a ruse or circumvention of the law, not to a breach of the rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this behavior should be as far as possible, illustrate the with the aim of punishment.
Wait and punishment.
Another question, however, is that the advantage of the culprits from his deliberate infringement will have.
Here, it is to be noted that the opponent getting into the handicaps, and that in the current struggle can not get any benefit, because the obvious result is that team itself will have less players.
And it's not even a useful strategy to another struggle, since the club will not be able to with these players count.
The advantage of obviously lies in the fact that the players to the next stage of the Champions League without the cards, which might be considered prejudicial to their participation in the future.
However, this is an advantage of a long - term perspective, and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i. e., at first sight, the team may be eliminated, and outside the following negotiations will have players punishment, and go to the second round of cards, in which the exclusion is enough for one card less than in the first round.
So what will be the wheels continue, it is not clear whether it is the advantage.
And, in short, these negotiations are against sports, which is to make the strategic decisions, which will make it possible to obtain the maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the event that we should not players to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather have chosen, when to obey him.
Did the strategic decision without, avoiding the punishment or fled before him.
Although it is not the border between the wit and circumvention clear, i believe that, in this case is clearly a wit.
It seems to me that a polemic arises from two reasons: because it was about two samovyloučení and because of the way in which the transfer of instructions to their provoking from leadership.
The damage to the sports principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
The fight offers a Christmas parties in Barcelona
Diktats calendar concentrated this avalanche reservations on 16 and 17 December.
Rapidly rising celebrations paid by the employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.

To complete the complication of steeled calendar this year (when Christmas Day of Friday) applications for a week from 13 December, resulting in an avalanche of reservations for days in the toe (16 and 17.), while in the previous week was almost no traffic.
How's it going on already from the year 2008, thin years, is the many firms, which collective parties from the budgetary reasons abolished.
In order to leave the traditions, many employees to pay the piper at parties from his own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many require prices on the border of the load, says the president of the Association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.

Trades go well, ``who offer quality and good at a reasonable price," says and recalls that, thanks to the crisis consumers have tended to go a step down and most customers now wants to spend around 25 euros.
Survey in various facilities, shows that the applications of the reservation is on the evening of 17 December.
The group Soteras reports real boom reserves to this Friday, while most requirements is at the expense of up to 30 euros, which fashioned offered the menu, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euro.
In other major companies, which is Andilana of 16 device in town (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), brought a peculiarity of this year's calendar, more early reservations and that since the beginning of November.
``We have made possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, of which should select each range from 19,95 to 30 Euro" , state.
In a group of an group to which it belongs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23, remain optimistic after the beginning in the second half of the increase profits and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The resources of this company stress that also 18 December will be vytíženým day, as will be held before Christmas celebrations among friends.
To his six group menu joined the menu Christmas, with the budget for 30 euros or more, as recorded in comparison with the previous year trend of guests spend about 10% more in exchange for other items like, for example, is the cava (spanish sparkling wine - attractive.).
Also noticed that there are already firms, which once again to their employees, and it seems that the size of groups is slightly larger.
Vice president of the company's Fecasarm (which includes the institutions such as the bar, restaurant and centers of free time in Barcelona) Enric Goma, he believes it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and argue that the number of reservations, ``revived," although clients of ``bargain at maximum."
This impression even during the Christmas celebrations yielded, whether, who pays points.
Pakistan's nuclear program has produced large unrest in the U. S.
ISLAMABAD produces nuclear weapons of ``at a faster pace than any other country."
Documents Wikileaks confirmed the links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the US published the portal Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest in Washington raises Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to the objasňujících and significant details, which offer on the content of the communication and ideas of the representatives of the North American Free Trade diplomacy in Islamabad, revealing these documents that cooperation between the two countries, as regards the nuclear safety, instead of increased, ``is on the wane" , and that this unstable asian country produces more ``nuclear weapons than any other state."
A peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are assembled, but stored after works, to be made more difficult to their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington, D. C.
This is calculated Ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before the visit to the National Security Advisor James Jones: ``the proximity of certain nuclear devices vis - à - vis the territory under the control of the Taliban, the spread of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
An increase in the number of persons associated with nuclear arsenály and with the missile is no longer observed only the US, but also of Russia, like the and representing the reason to be on the lookout.
````Pakistan had to go to the protection of nuclear facilities hire staff with strict religious faith; whereas the decline of the level of education and culture have extremist organizations more opportunities recruit people, who will work in the nuclear programmes or programmes missiles," said expert Yuri Korolev from Russia's Ministry of Foreign at a meeting with their counterparts, from the US.
The biggest novelty documentation published by the server Julian Assangeho is increasingly less cooperation between the US and Pakistan in topics the spread of nuclear weapons and increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
The trap issued by the Embassy in May, the assessment of communication with Pakistan as ``frustrating," says: ``transparency often does not exist; offers of help remain without a response, or are refused."
In the next report says Peter Lavoy, worker national intelligence services for the South Asia, that ``despite the economic catastrophe produces Pakistan nuclear weapons as fast as no other country in the world."
Ambassador Pettersonová also demands of Washington to during his visit to the boss of the Army General Ashfaqa Kayaniho, ``very well," explained that ``the Pakistani army must end with the support of the terrorist groups."
The hunt for the boss Wikileaks
Obama's name of a high - ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, in order to avoid new evasion of information.
Interpol issued a ``red challenge," with a view to trace and identify, where would Assange could be.
All concerning Wikileaks and its founder of Julian Assangeho are complicated labyrinth, where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced, ``extraordinary challenge," , i. e., red notice, to locate the ````and monitoring of movement" Assangeho.
But this is a classic command to detention.
Besides, this is not new, but dating back to 20 November.
And he has nothing to do with the last flight of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, assures the legal representative of the creator Wikileaks Mark Stephens, that ``the police know where and how to contact with Mr. Assangem" .
It was 20 November, when the chorus of international police located in the french Lyon issued this command, at the request of Sweden, credit, but it until yesterday, when it has received permission from the swedish authorities.
In this situation has 188 countries Interpol instructions to identify or localizing Assangeho ``with a view to impose the temporary custody and give it."
Although the Interpol can not order the detention of a person, which concerns the red challenge, many Member States, how the organisation explained, however, considered the so - called ``red notice for allowing the arrest of do - it must be ensured national component of the police - especially in the case where Member States have mutual agreement on the issue of detainees, as is the case in Sweden, and in England, where would probably be Assange should be.
This step demoted Assengeho lawyers who yesterday published in writing, where the claim that the 39 - year - old founder Wikileaks willing to answer the questions of the swedish authorities using videoconference.
Recall that Assenge asked and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from accompany Athos of your case, compared with the legendary Lavrentijem remorse Berijou, chief of Stalin's security.
``This is the hunt and no legal persecution" , the letter.
While it is looking for the whole world - and from Australia, his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange is on an unknown place, but the gun silent.
On Monday, provided through Skype from an unknown place interview Time magazine editor - in this conversation requested the resignation of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
``If that was responsible for the diplomats, the US, to carry out espionage in the UN and broken and the International Convention, which the United States signed, should resign," he said.
His views were yesterday rejected the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who request to qualify as ``ridiculous and absurd."
``I am not entirely sure, why should depend on the view of individuals, which operates a Web page," said for CNN.
Obama himself responsible for high - ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella TRAVERSE, in order to prevent further evasion documents.
The intention of the speaker of President Barack Obama stop add Assangemu on the importance of the stands in stark contrast with the views, which in these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, member of Congress, which will be since January, chairman of the Committee for the national security in the lower house, asking for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to examine the possibility to include Wikileaks between a terrorist organization, ``in order to be able to intervene and prosecute each, who could contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance."
Further went Tom Flanagan, advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should be ``killed" , which in turn had to appeal.
````Obama would have had a reward or use unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Who apologized, was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, a former guvernátor Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
``Everyone will be in the government, the one who is responsible for the leak, has committed treason and any other than the execution would be too modest," he said at the station Fox
Puigcercós looking for in the ERC peace of ``wincing," to the followers of Caroda
The republican leader will allow the side of a secret ballot of its remaining.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and the end of the schůzovního system.
Joan Puigcercós seem to have found a recipe, how to fight with already několikátou internal rebellion in the ranks of the ERC (left - wing Republican Party of Catalonia - attractive.), useless because of the loss of 11 members and half of the vote.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture on the resignation of seems to his supporters of the former leader Josepa Lluíse Caroda - Roviry inadequate, and also knows that the impact of this sector today is no longer so weakened as its leader, and that he absolutely can not do so worried, what was with other living currents.
Therefore, the leader of the left to try to get a new criticism by means of a twinkle, then, which will help him steel himself into the municipal elections.
First Puigcercós yesterday announced that more than 200 members of the National Committee shall be able to secretly say in his continuance in function.
By using the ballots, rather than a show of hands.
If they want to supporters Caroda forward to the chairman of the criminal voice, will not be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid disruption and surrender of his person.
In several interviews, argued that would be considered confirmed with half of the vote, and one, moreover, but added, without clarified the percentages, that too would not be a good outcome of ``after Bulgaria."
Supporters Caroda require the chairman of more than to give its function available - which are considered gesture, which has no weight, since Puigcercós controls on conferences, the largest authority.
But, whereas, they do not have sufficient majority, to enforce the resignation, will seek to the executive resemble the plan from now until May.
Because i expect to participate in the development of a document on strategic reorientation, which gives the leadership of the vote of the National Council on 18 th day of the month.
Their aim is to promote Puigcercóse in exchange for that this promise to move the Congress has already in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that the ``mnohohlasnost" harms stability, and that his goal is to once and for all was the organization able to fight their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems that the article, which the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercósův ideologue, this adviser for innovation took for granted that leader will be confirmed the ``in exchange for several objectives."
And the name of five, of which are two.
The first is the ``překomponování" executive so as to form a at least 90% of the members, which means also include new faces, who are from the sector friendly Carodovi.
The second objective may be big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC wholly put an end to schůzovnictvím as a mechanism functioning.
And so fights for reform of the statutes, in order to be able to take place congresses through the delegates of the selected by a vote.
To put an end to the model schůzovního system, the exemption in the spanish system of political parties, is intended to Puigcercósova team, which in this direction fought already on the last two conferences.
However, the cramped Assembly of the year 2008 decided that schůzovnictví must be assessed on a special Congress on reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, because the situation within the Party discouraged from a solution to this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, could be an appropriate time again this issue and try to her once and for all.

``To be masters of our ideas and the reality we must at spin control: and self - love most means many times paste finger into the wound and bother you individuals who are much more comfortable, as he thinks in Grotesque, black and white, in a fixed ideas and colourless, and to bother also authority, which prefer this black - and - white world" , he said, to support sense of writing.

Dupont partially blamoval
Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the canadian the Council for the standards of radio and television broadcasting (RRTV), owing to the controversial statements relating to social assistance and Haitians and, as well as for the gross expressing during the broadcast.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting considers that Mr. Dupont and his group of CHOI 98,1 FM should have the right to express their views, but some statements include the ``inaccurate information about the social assistance, and undue negative of Haitians gross expression that does not correspond to the broadcast vysílanému during the day."

The majority of the members of the Commission concludes that the traffic report was such that suicide can not be understood as a solution to the issues of the day - to - day life.
``Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of broadcasting" Dupontových lunch reports of ``the delicate topic impartial and in an appropriate manner."
It was not against him raised no criticism.
The last of the dispute concerned the Declaration, which followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean - René Dufort, put into a firefight media, which caused many responses.
The moderator CHOI said that sent no gift to help Haiťanům, because we can not know with certainty, that the necessary actually money.
The Commission considers that these comments were unjustified, but that their cumulative effect of creating undue negative image of Haitians.

``In my case, i am looking for games so little everywhere, because for those who do not like the game on Earth, which appears in the martial sports, are competition in North America rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as an assistant for UPS just added his opponents of bad news, when he won two gold medal at the World Cup in the World karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23. until 30 October, in Edimburgu, in Scotland.

450 million contracts without public competitions
Hydro - Quebec agreed upon mutual agreement 450 million in the contracts with firms providing Engineering to hydroelektrický project Eastmain - 1 - and - Sarcelle - Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it's just a consortium created from firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the contract, the contract for the management of the whole project in the total amount of 295 million dollars without public competition.
The consortium, on behalf of the Energy gérance was in 2004 authorised in parallel with the choice of the company's Hydro - Quebec, to committing to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this important hydroelektrického project in the $5 billion.
At the beginning of the year 2005 a consortium of ``Energy gérance" gained lucrative contract without any publication of a public competition.
For quebeckou side of the complaint to a consortium of businesses in front of us poses a serious problem ethical nature, which is risking the exclusion of competition and price increases.
``It's a new way to implement collusive action and to eliminate the competition."
``That means that people have the agreements do not secretly, today's doing openly" , said yesterday, a member of the PQ Sylvain Simard at the press conference.
Earlier this morning, M. Simard asked the question of the National Assembly, because, he says that he is, how can be sold to the public interest, as follows.
The Minister for natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau afternoon argued forcefully popírajíc, it would be for this contract on collusive action.
``I have my own way," bellowed and claimed that the PQ was ``dishonest" and ``lacked the accuracy."
She said, ``it would be the least" that would be the PQ apologized.
A recipe for the creation of a consortium is normal practice throughout the world.
This is usually the alliance, limited in time, which allows the two or more undertakings group of their mutual expertisy, in order to respond to the call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
Project Eastmain is a very complicated with regard to obsáhlost work.
The construction is already running, and must be phased in 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded, without competition can act; it was business.
It is also necessary to admit that, in the form of consortia is no longer in Quebec exception, and even at a relatively simple projects.
How revealed the last week of Le Devoir, formula consortia in consultancy in engineeringu is the subject of an investigation in the government.
Přelétneme - in the speed of the commercial register quebeckých firms, will allow us to appear more than 200 consortia, with some seem to be created.
Thus, the company of Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its main competitors; name Cima +, Génivar, DK - Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
As regards the consortium Energy gérance, Minister Normandeauová underscored, in particular, the fact that ``the territory of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamism of the work force, and that Hydro - Quebec at her responds since the 1970's," .
The main patron of the project Eastmain, Réal laporte, from the energy companies Baie James (SEBJ), explain that make us svraštit forehead over the fact that the contract on the management of the project was concluded by mutual agreement.
``If you are going to a public competition, and if there is a few of the participants competition, making the offer, your offered prices may be higher."
``You have a choice of two options: i. e. taking people, who are in the contract as participants competition, and say:" let's make a deal satisfactory, and with a good price."
``But the main idea is that important is the price, but the purview of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This Treaty granted a consortium of Energy gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50 000 $, who received a party of Quebec.
The contracts were concluded with the company Hydro - Quebec or SEBJ to project Eastmain - 1 - and - Sarcelle - Rupert.
After verification of Le Devoir counted 109 contracts on the advice in the field of engineeringu, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their branches, in particular with the laboratories carrying out the analyses of the soil samples.
DK - Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, from the Génivar of them gained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without a share in the ``Energy gérance" .
All the contracts were concluded.
Together now 449 783 344 $, including the contract with the company Energy gérance to 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies, which are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are ````very good friends of the liberal parties Quebec."
Minister Normandeauová unleashed a report that the PQ is also associated with firms, which her ``finance" before indicated that rather on its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - ````green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumer very little trust actors of sustainable development, but also ``neutral" and ecological certificate, to the driving in the selection of the products.
The worst of it is that, even when he bathed in the media space, which on us urges and calls for socially responsible consumption, wailing this media space above the lack of credible information, failure to comply with his obligations, which qualifies as a brake for its commitment, says Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article appeared yesterday.
Even though in 2010 consumption increased for example socially responsible products, the inhabitants of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, yet he did not believe
Two - thirds of us, in fact, they say, that they did not believe the promises of firms, relating to the environment, simply because that green advertising companies, finds measuring instrument, which has developed a Observatory responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubts about the credibility of the official certificate, přikládaných to for example fair products, but also about the credibility of the products and marks, which is referred to as environmentally responsible, says barometre.
In the same way, policymakers debate on this topic is accepted as a serious only 14,6% of the population of Quebec.
The information about the responsible consumption seems to be of paramount, however, to stimulate consumption of this page region currently nearly one - third of quebeckých consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and doubtful character of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
That's the second brake, which identified Baromètre, after a higher price of these products.
Indeed, one - third of the population Quebekuse builds suspiciously against any data on products or ``green" services, we are seeking to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010 was almost half of consumers willing to change your habits, and especially to change the mark of one or several products, which would have reacted to his conviction.
For 61% of them favoring purchases for traders from their neighborhoods, preferring to purchase food, grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More ``green" and responsible - index responsible consumption reached 64 from a maximum of 100 for this year - homo consumus Québeku likes to be presented as the King of recycling, which seeks to the smallest possible impact on the environment, that old on the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience obviously remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of the population of Quebec said that the use of public transport, or that they recommend the use of the car to at least two persons, in the interest of the protection of nature.
Walking and bike also supported to 39,1% of the participants of this extensive survey behavior, who used this cliché.
The loan of the State to the cinema eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the cinema eXcentris companies Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the complicity, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Developperská company ``Angus et le Parallèle" that sought to gift in the amount of seven million from the Minister of Culture to cinematographic complex on the boulevard Saint Laurent and that has demonstrated its mission as a lover of film, what requested.
The government accepts that will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than expected gift proposes government Quebec loan, which would have been lower, some of the original expectations, which could build a basis for a viable solution for favourable conditions, and with the resources comes from the State.
The first action plan, and the requirement to 12,8 million were already rejected Quebekem last spring, but applications have been revised reduction.
The proposal, and the business plan sent Secretary of St Pierre - president of the Society for the development of business in the culture of (SODEC), François Macerola, which controls the film project eXcentris.
The final report was sent to ten days ago.
But the counterclaim government came into society SODEC Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have time to 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the hypothesis gift from the State must really be rejected.
It is noted that the Association of cinema owners and cinematographic Center in Quebec was built against the direct investment State, to support the redemption eXcentrisu, usuzujíc, that the culture minister does not have to finance the project on real estate, when it has done for other kinosály.
But several participants discussions, on the other hand, demanded the key economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into space of their cinemas during the ten years film after he financed by the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the amendment of the financial of the Council of State.
The lack of halls for independent films is stark in Montréalu, and eXcentris could obtain permanent clientele.
The company Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his forehead, governed by the campaign for the release of the financial resources to the private sector, in the belief that the matter of $700 000 for extrude acquisitions.
In the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute movies for eXcentris.
The aim of the future of purchasers is open again, all three of the halls of 27 February next year, and now the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini reminded of Le Devoir and ignores, so he and his group thinks about the proposals to shrink, which are made him.
By the curtain to Canada as a whole.
The new diplomatic american springs referred to in known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considered inferiority complex Canadians vis - à - vis the Americans, but the same stroke suggests a sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprising that each canadian voters lies at the heart of kanadsko - american relations, when it comes to vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama's helped conservative government to was adopted its budget in 2009!
The four new messages between the U. S. Embassy in Ottawa, and Washington, yesterday landed on display public, moreover, sensitive details, to get the ``under the skin."
Communication with the date of the 22 September 2008, i. e., in the middle of the electoral campaign, details, at what point the United States is not part of the deal, the political leaders.
To the surprise of the U. S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides to this situation several explanations.
``The canadian inferiority complex, almost lingering on maybe political leaders to talk about internal fix, instead of to realize that these elections concerning the United States (as in the campaign of free trade in 1988)," writes.
``The United States are, therefore," concluded, ``the elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to them all."
The ambassador means that ``the silence" of less that both countries maintain an intense political and economic relations.
``It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the parties or, better still party leader to manage these important relations should be a key factor, which have the voters in mind when they are going to vote."
Other expression of this sense of self - worth can read in the report, which sent on 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, Chargé d 'Affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, in preparation for President Barack Obama to his first visit to Ottawa.
``Your path will help to ensure that the government in the vote of confidence in the beginning of February, relating to the federal budget, which Canada publicly admit to his first deficit for more than ten years, owing to the recovery plan in the amount of 30 - 40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There was no mention of it, that the government had to get a pre - christmas meeting of the Parliament, so that it can not be slaughtered coalition and that opposition parties makes his survival of the quality of the proposed a recovery plan.
Another message from January 2008 and signed the ambassador Wilkins, points out in Washington on increasingly negative image, which in the United States cast a dramatic works in CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the emission of the border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H 2 O, in which can be seen not too clever references to Maher Arar, ````well - Fly - sheet" or also on the hijacking of for the purposes of violent interrogation in the CIA.
Another message presented that, in their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his french partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to take some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of ``a case - by - case basis."
At the end of the meeting, it says here, ``to some paper, concerning the Omar Khadr, 15 - year old Muslim of canadian origin, state secretary."
``The Minister has adopted with it, that the folder revising" .
Finally, it should be noted that the persons concerned WikiLeaks, sweat.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor to the very close to Stephen Harper, said on the waves CBC, that the person responsible for this massive leak should be ``destroyed."
The word, and you heard about it, Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The world's a plan for the restoration of lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun plan for the reconstruction of the domestic lighting, lighting shops and industrial space in 100 countries, with a view to achieve the restriction of the greenhouse effect (G), which is almost one third of further restrictions, which should be achieved for the stabilization of our planet's climate from now on by 2020..
This ambitious plan is located in the stage of the large specific projects, which he wants to the UN to impose in Cancun, in order to compensate for the lack of a difficult for a commitment to retrench on the side of the industrialised countries.
According to the last plan submitted, if the incandescent light bulbs, which monopolize still 50 to 70% of the market, replace bulbs fluokompaktními or, better yet, bulbs with elektroluminiscentními diodes (DEL or ``ice" in English), the quantity of 1,8 billion tons (Gt) Ges emissions on the planet arising out of lighting would be odbouralo.
Lighting is responsible for the 8% of the world's emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen in the last year, the big countries with a significant proportion of on issues like the United States, China, Europe and other, between them, Canada, involved in the voluntary plans to reduce, which should allow the decline in global emissions Ges from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be deducted from this balance of 5 more Gt, to be achieved by 2020 stabilization warming of the climate for 2 degrees Celsius in order to be able to exclude, he can not get out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs 95% of the energy is dissipating in the form of heat, and the rest, i. e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluokompaktními bulbs consumption of energy reduces about 75%, and with new light bulbs with DEL, narrow it down this consumption twice more.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs last in diameter from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new light bulbs with DEL, such as stated this week in the production of Philips - this company allegedly participated in the study of the UN - have life expectancy 25 000 hours and consumes about 80% less energy than incandescent light, which gives us an idea of possible savings with a plan of the refund, which would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs may also work with reostaty and emit less heat.
And do not contain any mercury.
A few experts have expressed reservations about fluokompaktním light bulbs, because containing mercury and should be sort as hazardous waste, which is still possible in developing countries, unless the producers established a junkyard.
But, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet's fluokompaktní bulb, but rather the thermal coal - fired plants that emit many mercury necessary to produce the electricity wasted in the incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States of these headquarters put into circulation, 25 000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also in detail the profits from the international programme each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO 2, which is the equivalent of 3,5 thermal power stations, whose construction would be 2,5 billion
Côte d 'Ivoire awaits the outcome of the election results.
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki - Moon, took immediate public disclosure of the results of the presidential election in Côte d 'Ivoire after the expiration of the time limits laid down.
``The Secretary - General stresses the need for an independent of the Electoral Commission has finished his work, and immediately said preliminary results, the spokesman for the President of the UN."

In the center of throughout the world - 11 appeals to CEI declared at last, the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurentum Gbagbo and a member of the opposition Alassanem Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo relies on rescinding the Constitutional Board for ``fraudulent" vote in the north, which is administered by former guerrillas new Army (FH) from the failure of the state of the coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi n 'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Ivory Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers intimidation voters, which has practiced FN (a new Army) in the north of the country, discouraged supporters, president of Côte d' Ivoire from the went to vote.
Elections could be avoided if the Constitutional Board take into account, which he handed Gbagbo.
But the opponents of President Gbagbo consider that the Supreme Court of the country is not neutral, because it is governed by Paul Yao n 'Dré, very close to a political ally President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man from the North, who dementuje any connection with the former guerrillas, condemned the delay in the notice of the results of such as ``unacceptable" and asked Gbagba, to be respected, but so far, that would have demanded a victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that suffered a loss of, and that of a complaint to the Constitutional Board after defended the Electoral Commission broadcast results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, the ongoing on Sunday, it was considered a coronation process of reunification and the reconciliation of the country, which is no longer divided into two half.
The United Nations highlighted in the middle of a political faction Cote d 'Ivoire, that could be held liable for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended up in the first round, Oct. 31, a winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattaru, who won the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Because there have been attempts to negotiate through a discrete channels, ``quiet solves nothing" , the Iranians are ``masters of the on's evasive maneuvers."
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners' s ``iranian family tactic: a hostage taking for the purposes of political blackmail."
Announces that the exemption Klotildy Reissové (which is 16 August, on the day on which it will provide a safe haven of the French Embassy), ``will require payment of a large amounts of money, the Iranians" (bail 230 000 EUR).
And shall notify that elysejský palace anticipates cases hostage, the phenomenon that, ``will vyostřovat" .
The Iranians would ``in the future could arrest of other roughly 1800 of the french living in Iran," says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left jail before 12 days, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: the iranian Majid Kakavand, on which the United States proclaim that he was expelled for illegal trade with electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is in Paris on freedom, on the basis of the decision of the judge.
The U. S. embassy, as well as many observers requires this unsettling conformity.
For the Washington, which is illegal Iran's network to the acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, is the extension of Majida Khakavanda bad news.
France came to bargain?
The Iranians for the liberation of young women?
In a further conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, 4 September, François Richier assured that this is not so.
Elysejský palace, as stated, was not only ``surprised by this Decision Judge" , but for the possibility to face it.
````Held talks between the presidency and the minister of justice," (at the time, Michèle, Michele Alliot - Marie,), but ``the french government can not change the decision of the court," he says.
Mr. Richier wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the ``restricted" of the supervision of the french intelligence services.
Advisor to the Elysée is making a phone number, hanging up the phone and then inform the american diplomat, that the iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by Iran's Embassy."
At the time of their imprisonment Klotildy Reissové in Iran's evolving elysejský palace efforts, negotiate, through the communiqué and organised by the ``losses" to the media, in order to see that the syrian President Bachar al - Assad plays a ``major" and ``an influential" role of ``the mediator."
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony, and note that bears fruit, because several articles in the press reflects the official version.
A telegram from 25 August 2009 evokes media ``blest" of french official agents."
What is this level of ``gratitude" , expressed vis - à - vis the M. Assadovi, asks embassy in Paris.
``Despite their declaration of chvalořečí french official officials in the privacy of recognise that have only a vague idea of what the Syrians, in fact, made."
The document is then deals with the reasons, which forced elysejský palace pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication ``towards the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria" , analyses.
Policy applied in 2008, ``was observed many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as a premature and undeserved."
The ````how far the syrian role" , Paris, trying to ``demonstrate Syria, what eulogium can earn, when he played a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also ``plant grain of this excitement between Syria and Iran."
The american embassy knows it from a very good source.
11 August, François Richier was told him: ``we do not know, of course, if the Syrians do something, whatever it is."
``But we thanked them very much."
``It should at least befuddle and confusion between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reissová returning to France 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy it accepts in the Élysée Palace.
In a press thanking presidents Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their ``active role in the benefit of the exemption of our a fellow - countrywoman" .
The end of the on - line games after midnight for young builder
South Korea's government, adopt the law of the so - called ````peciválský," which will prohibit adolescentům play on - line game after midnight, that block access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December, so that he could ask companies operating on - line game of blocking access to these games after midnight persons under 16 years, the leaders of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
``Many children playing these games, all night and have problems with learning in school, and they are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
``We believe that this law is necessary for it, to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said for AFP yeah Rin, the principal agent at the Ministry, which has a bill to worry about.
On - line game will be newly accessible from 6 o 'clock in the morning.
The company will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, clarified.
The government also assumes that asks the companies to reduce the day - to - day time access to these games for young, whose parents so requests, the said responsible worker.
It can also be available to people who request it, free programs to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by the ``"and the daily press brings regularly different facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is at the same time, the undisputed master in the world's competitions in on - line.
In November, South Korea has four gold medal at the World Cyber Games, and it in the face of 58 other peoples.
The World Cup in the years 2018 - 2022: Fifa establishes the host country.
Full riots suspicion of corruption establishes the Executive Committee Fifa Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in the years 2018 and 2022, the selection of the most politically motivated, where the battle for influence and lobbying by the risk that surpassing technical criteria.
To be sure, the Royal Fifa in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain - Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium).
The World Cup, it will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hopes to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the african continent in 2010, or to continue to support to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
A list of the people who participate in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Zapatero Rodriguez, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince from Qatar, senior government officials Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create the idea of the scale of the economic and political bets around the world.
The negotiations in the wings at risk, that will take until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy, according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fifa documentation english, Spain - Portugal (2018) and the US (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission in an hour for voting.
Sunday Times, in the early detection, leading to a suspension of two members of the CE / of the European Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adam), maybe so ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which so far hosted by the World Championships only once, in a year.
The BBC in Monday on the crown, when aired the document that ``nailed to pin" three influential members of the CE (the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How make Fifa nespokojenou and get into difficulties english leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
President of the Government hopes that he will be able to repeat the move, who succeeded his predecessors in function Tony Blair, which in 2005 managed to get to London organization of the Olympic Games in 2012.
It will be enough to this intense activity to England added new lustre his name for the CE (the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because of a pair of Spain - Portugal missing Trumps already prepared stadiums, his bill (the World Championships in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games, 1992 in Barcelona, the euro - 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial perspective of both countries could give these ambitions cold shower.
Any reprisals against the English and doubts about the payment of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was a basket case, despite the gaps in his dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the World Cup put into Zurich and publicly declared a ``unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal innuendo just barely twisted to the charge of the english print vis - à - vis the members of the CE (the European Commission).
``We will be after them to throw mud, we will try to get them to compromise," said Mr. Poutin.
For the year 2022 seem to be the logical choice, the United States, with its extensive experience of 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the seat of the major sponsors Fifa, it seems that this country has a big ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produce beautiful project.
But these candidacy seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 have ``rehearsal" .
Another threat: the World Cup 2026 China, which was dying wishes Fifa, made of Asia's chances for the year 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, which he drew from his sleeve Capital ace in the form of a futuristic stadiums, and Australia, would Fifa continued its expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries represent more than the risk of securities.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for poor fees tv (due to the time lag) paid european countries, forming a powerful force for Fifa.
The second mandate: zřejmost (security)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up the impression that hesitates.
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac nezaváhali did not in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate elysejskému palace summoner someone else.
The current head of state will therefore candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost is not in a good conformity with a share of the mystery of the associated with a presidential functions.
It is, therefore, to do, as it would no doubt constantly persisted.
In one in the second meaning.
In 2006, without it wanted to believe, friends of Jacques Chirac to do unto claims to third mandate was excluded.
Of 15 November with a serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy said that ``we decide sometime in the autumn of the year 2011."
How reminds before the members of Parliament UMP Wednesday night in the Élysée Palace, the perspective of the ``two mandates" planted little feverish state.
It was official announcement of his candidacy?
He was not from that far.
The president only reminded that the adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 to reduce the number of five years in office in two.
It was from his party just a statement, no notification.
This is not the first time he reminds at such meetings comic tone of the presidential elections.
``In the worst case, or in the best case, you have a seven and a half year with me," he said in July 2009.
The rebellion in May 2010: ``do not think that i am on the next stage."
The day before yesterday's statements, it does not make a candidate for more than the previous day; do not make him candidate, no less.
If the cause comment, it is due to the double the truth.
Speed up the path to run into the PA, on the one hand.
But it's entry into the arena Ségolèna Royal, what' s Nicolas Sarkozy's, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012, it is obvious that many in the PA to organize to combat reports rather premature than intended.
A survey, on the other hand.
First, the voters right would prefer the nomination of François Fillon before the candidacy Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% against 44%, according to the BVA - L' Express).
``We have a candidate and not discussing the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously people from the vicinity of the President of the government.
``If they believe possible defeat, will not run," says Jean - Pierre Raffarin.
``She will still believe that may win" , repairs Alain Juppé, balanced, unlike.
The euro: the European Central Bank to continue their buying government titles.
The last of the meetings of the Governing Council of the central in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the rationale of the crisis, or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis sovereign of the European claims undertakes, Institute for the issue of the securities will undoubtedly be able to afford to be so many of the attitude under the threat of the deterioration of the situation now so tense on european markets, with the securities.
The political price in such a case, was it higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to an active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of the crisis management of receivables european states.
I did not want to tell whether he thinks that the bank could do more to it, for example, that would have increased their program for the purchase of sovereign bonds.
````Reserve your account for my european partners (...) " .
The evening before that, in Brussels, during his interrogation of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean - Claude Trichet, did not show up like výřečnější, as regards his intentions, and he contented himself with that, said that the purchase of state titles in the secondary market ``continues," and that ``we will see how decide" during the meeting to be held this Thursday.
The only security: the Central European Bank will keep its basic constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of the bonds of Treasury made by the Central European Bank in the last week of doubled to nearly 1.35 billion.
And, thanks to the foolishness dohodců on the market has made the last new purchases of irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, central banks eurosystému bought to 67 billion from May 2010.
Between dealers in the market in the sense of anticipation on the continuation of purchases permitted no doubt (see page 29).
Neither the economists expect any significant change course.
If the operation of the loans for more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal of central european banks, these latter Bank to unlimited provision of liquid funds under the generous conditions and the duration of from one week within three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for several months.
``I can not imagine that would have changed significantly its program."
``If not, it would mean to take the risk of invocation of short - term new tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist Commerzbank.
````Progressive way out of the notified during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan their interventions on the market, with public debt, ``would have to the European Central Bank to maintain the volume of the purchase of its obligations to revive the languid market," attached Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of european banks on markets with the sovereign debt in the euro area has continued to the selection of anything other than to maintain their presence on the market.
``He needs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of paid by the performance of the States belonging to among the most fragile" , testified yesterday, a significant Manager of the bonds.
Because if interest rates rose and fell, states that more, in order to reduce their debt, rather than stabilized.
It is the rescue of the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's drooping wearily back
After the start of the week for Italy worrying situation is more relaxed, yesterday to the flow of the bond of interest to 10 years.
BACK to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for the economy of the regions, they said that they heard Giulio Tremonti, how assessment of the situation as ``nerozřešitelnou" and it expects to ``unpredictable," the weekend, which then order issued a statement denying.
In any case, Tuesday deviation from long german interest reached record 210 basis points and price contracts to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared to 263 points, which in Rome caused some excitement.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi remarked that, in Spain, the derogation with german interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he was ``too busy," ``the markets" and possible contagion originating from Ireland.
``The good news is that, Italy, the third of the euro - zone economy, it is not like Greece or Ireland."
``The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, and the clear, the problem is the lack of growth and a weak fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the risk that will not be able to cover its needs of financing.
The latest forecasts Brussels were for the government cold shower.
Italy's growth is now expected to 1,1% in 2011 and on 1,4% in 2012... while the budget, which is available to the Senate to his analysis, on 1,3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the calculation, the European Commission will be public finance deficit be a 4,3% of gross domestic product in the next year (against 3,9% of the Government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Here the reputation of a new set of amendments to the draft budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the $7 billion.
``If necessary, it will have to be taken strict new measures" , evaluates the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy accepts the support of the international institutions.
``The cornerstones of its economy are in order, and its calculations are correct, we repeat it has been a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
``There's no immediate problem, not even the short - term or long - term, because, despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), it' s efforts to stabilize the required in Italy, less than the efforts required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist OCDE.
The question remains of political instability.
Of 14 December will be Silvio Berlusconi face a proposal to censure the Chamber of Deputies and subsequently after that could be to organize elections, with which envisaged at the end of March.
Launched the period, the little appropriate for the adoption of a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the strengthening of protikrizových mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde it yesterday reiterated in the framework of the press conference in Paris: ``i think that Europeans it demonstrated in Sunday throughout the day and night, are clearly very solidarity determined, engaged to defend its currency and its currency zone."
Although everything is relative, the last recorded expansion, in respect of interest at the european government bonds, brought the water for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can not talk about the beginning of standardisation.
The Office for the notation Standard &amp; Poor's announced that he could outrank record on the debt of Portugal, the objectives, which is the most focus of the various speculation.
``Because in May's real insufficiently transparent and clear policy, based in particular on banking systems," says the economists Exane BNP Paribas.

Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since it is the debate on the modernisation of transport on Ile - de - France in full swing, it's raining billion.
At least during the discussion.
It is recalled especially 23 billion on the subway Grand Paris, which is to build a company of Société du Grand Paris.
To this building could be started, announced the provision of the state subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
Theoretically, it's the amount, which allow society of the SGP apply to contracts part of the financing of her dual resources.
It's finally getting to the first amendments.
Fractioning the law on finances in 2010, which explores the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms laid down to ensure that these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax equipment and tax increase from the offices of the Ile - de - France.
First, read in the text of the proposal of the law, Article 15, ``in favour of public institutions Société du Grand Paris" .
Is denominated: ``yield from this interest is 117 million per year."
The second is the reconstruction of rates for office, which already exists, therefore, ``to be modernized, in order to increase the yield from her obtained, and that this increase in the affected by the company's Société du Grand Paris" .
How much would it work?
A mirage.
It's not quantified in the text.
In 4 billion, we have got far.
``It is clarified that these fiscal resources are attached to 4 billion of capital injections, which will be mobilized State and inserted into the company of Société du Grand Paris, according to the project," we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
Us in the company of the SGP this system seems shocking.
``Since we have created a revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for a period of three years, and then grab into 4 billion, explains here."
``It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary."
The company SGP considers that 4 billion will be credited to in 2013 for the budget for the financial year 2014.
This mechanism, in which promised 4 billion is still absent abonentům, risks provoking a somewhat the parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and přičinliví spies
Case WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it is exposed manifest scandal, scandal, which seems to be the only in the face of hypocrisy, which shall be governed by the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, indicative of the deep changes at the international level, and anticipates future ruled by regression.
But let's go over in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is a confirmation of the fact that every document drawn up by the Secret Service (any nation) consists exclusively of printing cuts.
``Extraordinary discovery" Americans about the way of life sexually Berlusconi is notified to it, he's already for months, everyone can read in any (all except those two Berlusconi' s own), and of karikaturní profile Kadáfího was already long for neuro artists device for the sketches..
Rule, according to which classified documents may consist only of the reports of the already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you are going to the bookstore dedicated to ezoterické literature, you will see that each of the work of repeated (Graalu, mystery rennes - le - Château, templářích or freemasons, if i might) exactly what it has been written in the previous works.
And it was not only because of that, the author of the occult texts i searching for new information (even knows, where the search reports on a non - existent), but because of those who are engaged in the occult believe only what we know and what confirms what already learned.
It is a mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
The same is true for the secret papers.
The informant's lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) the head of the secret service (and, if not, it could be, how do i know, editor in the papers Libération), which it considers true only what it alone.
Information with high suppression of Berlusconi, which the U. S. embassy sent the government, the same, which Newsweek published a week before.
Why, then, around the revelation of these documents do so much?
On the one hand, they say it, what each cultured man already knows, and that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and since may heads of states to call or fly a plane in common dinner, lost its diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation shall be transformed in Intelligence.
Any spectator watching films on investigations very well knows it, that only from self - righteousness' s seemingly ignores.
Nevertheless, the fact that it reiterates publicly, decries the obligation of hypocrisy and hurled it bad light on american diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker may obtain the strictest classified information, the most powerful country in the world, represents a hard blow, rather than a substantial, for the prestige of the state government.
The scandal affects how victims, as well as his ``U" .
But let's get out of here to the truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell, it was possible to absorb all power, like a Big Brother, who has checked every movement of its people.
Orvellovo prophecy was demonstrated, since thanks to the opportunity to check every movement, thanks to the phone, each of the transaction, - Hotel, used the highway, and so on, became a citizen of the victim of the rim of power.
But when demonstrated how it is now, that even a ``tomb" with nejtajnějšími information powerful can not resist intervention a hacker, ceases to be the control report a one - way and becomes a circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen of the Avenger -, may know all the secrets of power.
How can he hold power, which has already does not have the option to keep their own secret?
It is true that the already Georg Simmel said that the real secret's bezobsažné secret (and bezobsažné secret it could never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the nature of Berlusconi' s or Merkel is really mysterious bezobsažným secret, because it is drawn from public life; but, as it did WikiLeaks, that the mystery Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými secrets, means withdraw him all the power.
WikiLeaks did not do any mistake in Sarkozy's or Merkel, but by the something big Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow bestowed upon the powers so important?
It is clear that, in the future, states will not be able to send the on - line of sensitive information - it would be tantamount to its publication on the poster taped on the corner of the street.
But it is also obvious that the current technology is unnecessary hope that can be sustained in undercover report on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to determine whether and when the head of state has travelled by plane and joined with some of his colleagues.
How will be able to be in the future retained in the classification of the private and sensitive news?
Well, i know that, for the moment has forecast belongs to the science - fiction, and it is therefore a fantastic, but i have to imagine the government officials, who shall be transported discreetly carrying out formalities after uncontrollable routes and carrying around only those reports, which they know the heart, or rather hiding rare information in his shoes.
The information will be preserved in a unique copies in drawers concluded the key: the whole, an attempt to espionage in the case of the Watergate had a little success than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, it means backwards.
A century after Wireless telegraph revolutionized the roads, Internet rehabilitating telegraph, based on the wires (telephone).
Video (analogue) to allow for lovers of the movies on film, step by step, push it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CD (digital) allow only jump after chapters, it means after makroporcích.
Through the high - speed train we get from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the path of the aircraft and the transport, which includes the need for three and a half hours.
It is therefore important that policy and communications technology will return to the wagons towed horses.
The last note.
Sometimes, printing tried to understand what had in secret embassy.
Now they are embassies, which are confidential information from the press.
The climate is: how France hackla their promises of financing
In the year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to check compliance with promises to quickly odblokovaná financing (which financing with Quick Start (fast start) or premature), followed by the developed countries.
And the French hacky were disclosed
In Copenhagen agreement with the developed countries committed to provide 30 billion in 2010 - 2012.
The European Union has promised 7,2 billion for three years, and France 1,26 billion (that is, 420 million per year).
At the start of the COP 16 EU pulled out of the Great ace, to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to the financing of fast start: the report of the advanced action of its Member States, press conference, Grand side - by - side refrigerators event, distribute pamphlets.
Transparent operation invaluable and priced at their real value: the advanced countries and civil society, that's all the advanced countries and civil society, and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that, in 2010 €2,2 billion, making it brings on the right path to comply with its promise of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we will find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are under the Copenhagen agreement of the ``new and additional" , in order to ensure that it is increased burden implemented without, would be to the detriment of public support for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what it means ``new and additional" .
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, among other things, and France, the process of blocked.
Today, each selects the reference, which fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, considered the reference year 2009: the international finance to preserve and she still adds 150 million for three years, the financing of fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar References with annual payment deadlines or with the terms on the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of ``all new projects" by 2010 are ``new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure for the previous period, or to the global level of public assistance for the development of the D 'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of aid, France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), has the honor its commitment on the financing of the ``new and additional."
Next, a crucial element is the division of the gifts and loans.
There is still does not exist rule and each will choose their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that, 1 €loaned equal to €1 minute.
Obviously, it's hard to demonstrable: the effort is not equivalent.
If the application of loans can be evidenced for some of the investment, which are profitable (often regards projects related to reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro, which will, as the equivalent of one of the euro, which we..., we should not be seen by virtue of their obligations, but as the price of a loan for the creditor country (i. e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France may submit only such a justification: ``the" its commitment of 420 million, it's 91,5% of the loan (389,8 million) and 8,5% of the gifts (36,1 million) - see document of the EU, to allow themselves to verify.
It is the only country of the Union, which on such a scale uses a loan.
Germany was required 46%, while the Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% of the gifts.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union to 1 €on in the framework of the satisfaction of his promise, France only 10 centimes and considers this effort for a comparable.
A beautiful kejklířský!
For a summary, in its financing of ``fast start" France is operating with a dual šejdířstvím: on the one hand, with the development of the shares in time, and on the other side with the real financial burden.
Although spends only 36,1 million, can convince that issued 420 million of the ``new and additional" in connection with their promises.
The handling of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that, although it's Bercy, who was such decisions) could have double negative impact, at the same time, within the EU (why the Member States would continue to the donation, if only to lend?), and in the negotiation, because the developing countries are not completely.
CHAPTER early financing is only a small otázečkou, relatively short - term, in relation to a series of discussions about climate.
But it could be a grain of sand, moreover, in a machine, which is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
Whether anything, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of the early financing.
Soon should France to announce a change in my way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in compliance with their obligations and decency and justice vis - à - vis the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should avoid debate on deposits in the long - term financing (other crucial chapter currently under consideration): will the issue of the ``the additionality" or on the posting loans.
France should change its position in order to become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as it is for the other.
All hope is inserted into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko - Morizetové, which is coming to Cancun next week.
Surprising announcement of fast launch of France and its vision of ``the additionality" and the use of loans could give rise to an increase in the level of international confidence, to the necessary in order to be able to go in discussions.
The alarm pesticides, which children engulfed.
Ten - year - old child will devour one day 81 various chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of future generations (ex - movement for rights and conservation of future generations).
The Association, which points out that the results of the ``do not have significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the pending issues" , bought between July and September food commonly consumed by in four meals and one easy food as light lunch for one child roughly ten - year in supermarkets in L 'of Oise and in Paris.
The typical food, including the official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analysed research laboratories on chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting factors.
The balance of the plates is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, from the 42 ranks among the carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as much as 37 substances, which could act as disruptive for glands with the internal secretions (PE), according to the studies of several institutions, such as the International Centre for cancer research.
``Even if in almost all cases legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research okay, we see that reality in consumer exposure kontaminujícím substances, maybe carcinogenic, and / or PE is astonishing," says Association.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk contain themselves about ten résiduí with possible carcinogenic effects and three identified as a carcinogen, as in the case of about twenty residues, which could distort hormonal system.
An apple, imported from Brazil, the studies as a small Snack, contains traces of six chemicals, inter alia, in France banned fungicidal resource.
The same applies to the Green Beans from Kenyi, covered by lunchtime, for which the study found traces of strong insecticides banned within the EU.
Moreover, the steak from minced meat, tuna in a tin and even bread and gum were punctuated with of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the faucet analysis revealed in the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Salmon Steak for dinner was ``the richest" with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even analysis of plastic plates used for heating food in the microwave to be analysis.
The final risk for the consumer of this ``Cocktail contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," resulting from the study.
The ecological Europe - green (EE - LV) proposed ``in the face of an emergency situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the ``an increase of civilization diseases."
In July, the study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of the presence of residues 365 various pesticide identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereáliích.
