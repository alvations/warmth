What do you do? The ODS knows nor cukrárnu Voldemorta in Prague.
New councilors of the capital city of the ODS will have to be overcome a linguistic barrier to the Prague Council and the Representation understand their re-elected colleagues from the party.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council of the ODS 'vigour' how depressingly familiar with a slang, who was on the council over the past few years, when the Prague of the current governing coalition partners.
Kódovaný vocabulary that the Prague political cream introduced during the previous era of Mayor Paul Béma, describes some of the most famous figures of the situation and the trials in the city.
Surprisingly, it has emerged that the new councilors known terms too.
At least it says.
'Who is Voldemort?'
"I really do not know."
"I am in the Prague policy more newcomers," to respond to the test 'kmotrovského' slovníčku councilors for Culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And while it is a political veteran, responded similarly, councilors Karl Březina.
To be the term 'golf jamka'.
"This is the only expression of those giving me that sometimes I am using."
"Otherwise slang generally do. '
From slovníčku, whose expressions Aktuálně.cz newspaper published in June this year, prior to the election the Congress of the ODS, took office six examples, mostly those that are associated with the notorious Prague magistrátem.
The Socialists should explain the terms' Voldemort ',' the greatest golf jamka in Prague ',' go into ice ',' bullish šíje ',' betrayal of the capital city, 'and' oplechovat '.
The trio of councillors with kvízem agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, which has a branch in future pražskému education - first conversation has promised, but later took the phone.
Five councillors Peter Dolínek straight refused the test.
"All of these things, and that is as entertaining neřeším the Civic Democrats, not '.
"I now Špidla, as we understand it in the context of our programs," he responded.
As already mentioned, councilors Lukáš Kaucký in heading the supposedly nerozeznal that we are talking about 35 entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora Béma Romano Janouškovi.
'Voldemort' Kauckému he says nothing, and the only date that the test correctly guessed, is' the greatest golf jamka in Prague.
"This is a tunnel Blanka Kaucký," he says, and adds: "But I know this more from the newspapers'.
"I'd have to pay a language course, 'vtipkuje.
Golfovou jamku then as tunnel Blanka administration dešifruje only matador Karl Březina, but councilors Environment Lukáš timid.
Both the Social Democrats know then who is really Voldemort and Lukáši Plachému is familiar, as well as where to find suspect this figure - the importance of the term 'go on the ice. "
"I think this is to go to some the Prague 'is timid close to the deal, it is a seat Janouškových firms.
Pursuant to Březina reminiscent of that knowledge načerpal rather than from newspapers to use such language.
In social democracy according to wither test the prevailing slovníček slangových no similar expressions.
"I am advised, with colleagues, but it seems that there is really nothing of the sort, no. '
'We say more names, sometimes using the acronyms and distortions of names, "he says of the ODS Prague Peter Hulínský, which dubbed straníci Hulda.
'At school Bříza told me, but I do not know if I say so and colleagues, "admits to own přezdívce Karl Březina.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz pioneered the name and works.
Councilors Weinert is for sharper Děda or less friendly Dědek zastupitel B6-0017, a newcomer, who at themselves before the elections out fraud in the party, has some sponzoringu colleagues dubbed the 'Igráček'.
Přezdívky are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in vnitrostranické admit the union.
Hulínský supposedly Huldu I hear, but the newspaper noted Aktuálně.cz and another dubbed the Prague of the President.
'Doctor obuškového rights' "recalls that Peter Hulínský won the title at the Bratislava JUDr. police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture 'čarodějnic' issued a brochure
Women deemed in rural Faso for Witch-hunters have some common features.
Belongs to the older generation, unable to get into work, for example, for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
Those čarodějnicí 'will', it is sent to the isolation that do not jeopardise the rest of the village.
"This is the fate of the men to meet very rarely.
'Neodsouvají the young healthy women, because they help to work and have children born' describes řádová sister, who is in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso old in a special house for more than a hundred women from their own ranks vyhostilo their community.
The local government has now against abnormal 'social' measures decided to act.

But the thing is the rub.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in rural Faso cannot read, 'attention to the disadvantage of a written explanation newspaper The Standard.
Accusations of sorcery is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which with neighbouring Burkinou Faso last week died dvaasedmdesátiletá Ammy Hemmahová then, three women and two men abducted, polili petroleum and set fire to it.
The case told the BBC website.
The perpetrators claim that it was bad luck.
The woman, in their version of the vznítil oil, which is used to rituálnímu anointing.
Vzplál said, after a group of women 'would expel evil spirit'.
Isolation 'čarodějnic' support of the people, regardless of the level of educational attainment.
Newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: 'Požíračky human souls were always the danger, "he said.
While in the rural Faso, witch hunt trying to restrain the government, in the Gambia, even in the last year, it was the president himself.

After international pressure was, in the end, almost a thousand prisoners released.
Bakalův nájemník: Mired in stoves, higher rent signed
The older man reached the door klientského shock from the centre of society role-playing apartments' uhlobarona 'Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of homes inhabited in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm to bore component and the new lease agreement to three bytům: My, my daughter and my son, who is in prison.
All three precisely deregulation heels of rent.
Instead of lambasting son month will from next year have to pay for the apartment 2 + 1 second category 4100 kronor.
"And it is not warm water and awash with stoves must petrama (the rigid fuel fly-tipping, mixing.), 'it shows a man in a finger synově on the signing of the new treaty, which has the full power.
'But I signed it, "explains half-Eastern naštvaně half-Eastern and resigned.
Civic associations BytyOKD.cz new lease conditions is "incorrect and indecent," advised the tenants of the new Treaty nepodepisovat and wait until 7 December, when it will publish guidance on how to proceed against them.
But the man over, no hands.
'One says this, the other doesn' mračí.
Ostravsko becomes a great laboratory of deregulation.
After a year of waiting for the great majority of New apartments, which have in the Czech Republic have to rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the laboratory 'to' personally.
Havířovská room role-playing is one of four in total Ostravsku and Tuesday at nine in the morning, it is already full.
Right next door is the stamps from security agencies and with her vyvolávací device.
'Rent 2011', it is a special button on its dotykovém the screen.
One ťuknutí and the machines by a paper with a number.
Nestihnete or read '157' and your figure already pípá on a large screen waiting below the ceiling.
For half a second, you are on the line.
To rent, after a bit, ask the older couple will, bout in the waiting room, but new leasing obviously not at all.
Most people came to solve common problems, such as ever - requests for repairs, insurance and similar events.
Letters with new nájemními contracts become Ostravsku in the postal letterboxes tenants majority of a total of 44 of thousands of homes around the portfolio of role-playing since the middle of November.
Role-playing condominiums them letters proposing an increase in rent, about 15 to 38 percent.
Special přepážka to new nájmům klientském the centre was opened on 18 November.
"This is over a week, so it is only in the period," researcher in the bank after a moment of hesitation when the client presents as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalovy former coal-mining condominiums are local incendiary topic.
Before the election it loudly enough seized Vice-President of the European Parliament and the native ostravský Lubomír Zaorálek of the ODS, and even now are local newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years after them chcu new floor. '
"Neither pos... Ana CD záchodě nevyměnili to me, 'ulevuje in úvodou the man.
So far, most of the workers are pensioners, to ascertain whether they get a discount on the rent if they sign on time as role-playing in the special menu promises.
Half the discount on rent in February, will receive the other tenants, who will sign a new contract until 15 December.
Havířovská 'deregulatory' přepážka but questions certainly is congested.
"From yesterday's 360 clients because the rent for 2011 was only about 40 to 50 people, 'researchers estimate for the bank.
Role-playing on the Web and its nástěnkách proposes individual negotiating contracts where it is needed.
However, if the rent, both sides agree, it will have to establish an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but it is only possible for information about and quite legitimate legal procedure, 'draws role-playing on its website.
"There is no judge will think, 'one of the female role-playing condominiums and the man on the street before klientským centre gives it partly right.
'I am 13 of thousands of pension and left me five thousand to eat, I have to try it, "he says.
But in the wake of all the uncertainties.
"We will see."
'Mr Zaorálek vzkazuje them in the media, and perhaps sign people wait' thinking.
Rents at the end of regulation in most of the Czech Republic in the New Year of 2011, and role-playing apartments is their increasing economic necessity.
"The rent is still below the level necessary for a simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Paul Klimeš, director of portfolio companies rezidenčního role-playing apartments, that tenant naštvaným vytýkaná neglect of the housing stock, according to homeowners is the main reason for the increase in rent.
While for the five years between 2005 and 2010 could role-playing from rents apartments to invest in four billion in four years from 2011 to 2014, it has to be 5.2 billion.
Velkoplošná screen hanging on the ceiling by contrast, polstrovaným sedačkám havířovské waiting yet repeats several red accentuated information.
"An increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the homes' role-playing.
"And it always will be the most about 7,50 10 metre square and month," will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from rent rises by role-playing portfolio of 38 per cent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from the extremely low amounts 19,66 10 metre square, 'draws role-playing.
The 2600 apartments rent for the next year, will remain the same.
Role-playing condominiums promises that deregulation nevyžene 6,000 tenants, but it will be distributed to four to eight years.
Moreover, adds further commitment: All the money from the rent increases (see chart) will give the company back into the homes, especially in the heat of the savings - new windows and insulation.
The priority is to get the people who sign up to the agreement to increase the rent.
Agents to include kind, understand the architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in May, is the headquarters of the new society Arch.Design.
Nobody would have expected that conceals also miniškolku with all that that entails - with colorful walls, a creative furniture kupou toys and even miniaturním Playground on outdoor terase.
Since October of last year, it may visit children Arch.Designu. employees.
Projekčně-architektonická Arch.Design company, whose ateliérů came in a number of significant brněnských buildings, in the direction of space for its corporate miniškolku from his first steal Avriopoint buildings.
Employs nearly 90 people, mostly aged babyboomu and it mattered to women projektantky and the architect can quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of zkrácených half-posts benefitem Arch.Design is kind, which offers its employees in the context of social agenda.

Thanks to the grant funding (subsidy of $2, 8 miles. 10) to buy equipment and facilities, and for a period of two years to ensure qualified personnel and operations.
After exhausting financial subsidies (2 years) is society Arch.Design duty for a period of 3 years to run miniškolku on its own costs.
The project has lasted for one year, with applications for the subsidy helping society economy rating.
Care provides qualified personnel, children looked on health care nurse and teacher in nurseries can therefore MŠ beat children without age restrictions, but it is still most older 3 years.
Because it is all about 'miniškolku', there may be only five children at the same time, during the day, but they are to be replaced by even more.
Traffic schools is flexible according to the needs of parents and children all employees have the same right to use Schirnding, regardless of status in the hierarchy of the company.
Although it is the individual education and care, TV content in miniškolce is comparable with the Framework Programme pre-school education.

The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can ever checked their child and fall stress the situation reflected vyzvedáváním children from kindergartens remote from the workplace parents.

The house of the bones are fascinated, even after 100 years. A look at the spraying from the icon
The roof looks like successive pravěkého ještěra, a staircase recalls the backbone of the dinosaur and balkony are open fish lips.
This is the house of the Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni icon.
From the local to the house because of its organic tvarům has dubbed the House from the bones.
Organic tvary, wild colors, unusual use of stone, debris kachlů and mosaic facade, reminiscent of šupiny and ubiquitous soft limit-value, all of this is typical of the secession Antoni icon.
Making the house look fantasy line něžné colours and textury reminiscent of nature and animals.
In a detailed observation is seen geometričnost, rhythm and that is exactly the right order.
At night the whole facade home sounds even more dramatic is nasvícená, so that was the impression of colors luster even entail.
Vinutí and Europe--and shapes to the same extent in the interiérech.
Timber in waves mimics okenní bars zábradlí, ozdobné elements door, kukátka and lišty.
Batlló house, which is in the district of Eixample in an animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43, rearranging the house in 1877 from designer Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction was two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and creating a completely new, but the idea soon adopted icon on the rebuilding of the unusual and cheaper.
Činžovní house Casa Batlló but Antoni Gaudí proposing himself.
I worked with him, the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On his projektantském prkně arose decorations for representational apartment owners of real estate, as well as the use of mosaic clinging on.
Clinging to work and many other creators and artists.
The work on the house, Casa Batlló launched a successful cooperation Jujola with Gaudím.
Jujol was involved in the construction of the house, Casa icon expenditure and Park Güell in which are another icon works.
From local a house soon after the completion of the fallen, thanks to its organic tvarům dubbed the 'History of the bones'.
Others it due to the specific mechanism of opening windows started to call 'zívajícím house'.
It also says that, at the height of the building is vypodobněn sword saint, St George, Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include sochařské other elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house at the time of the proposed its unique system with odvětrávacími central heating vents and typical komíny.
Bizarre may seem their forty five stupňový streak.
In creating Gaudí totally respected former construction regulations and left them in the tie.
At the beginning of construction, while gaining planning permission from the city, but he said the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later when the result of the completion of the city council and wanted to repair zhrozena.
Radním objected, for example, that the construction of the pillars of the cold and in the bird.
To rectify this never happened, on the contrary: Only 15 days after the challenge of urban, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully) won permission to lease two top of the buildings.
Owner himself the man to step into the lower tiers.
In the gallery, in the second floor was social Club and the third floor ložnice and private part of the apartment.
The bottom was pronajato klenotnictví.
The whole house šestipatrový crosses a staircase, which can climb up to the roof terasu.
Major elements of the redevelopment was lifting all sil angles and direct lines and their replacement zakřivenými walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of the intertwining of space.
Can the social part of the opening of the door completely marketrelated salonních and greater society together can comfortably to communicate without the same heroic privacy needed for intimate talks.
The house with the icon rearranging won in addition to the new fronts also unconventional roof and two floors.
Impressive is the icon of the game, the light blue and bíle glazované dlaždice, obložen Internal Auditors and světlíky.
Game two colours gives maximum light in all echelons of the house.
It is enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects the light more than tmavá, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló house, which was in 2005 included in the Fund's World Heritage Site, anyone can visit.
In the first floor of the house is nejprostornější and nejhonosnější apartment made available to the public.
Owners decided for this step up in 2002, on the occasion of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the birth of a famous designer.
For examinations, because getting found out that it is a very lucrative business, and searches of the premises and extended podkrovní, including the roof terrace.
Vstupné into memory is certainly not negligible, is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners and a group of holders of tourist průkazek have a 20% discount.
The sum exceeds the price vstupného icon to other buildings in the city.
If you want a taste of the atmosphere of the house with dračími věžičkami, you quickly skamarádit with some of the inhabitants činžáku and visit him directly at home.
How to choose and matraci rošt: Women have different requirements than men.
Not honosný rám bed, but the quality of the surface, i.e. lehací matrace rošt, and provide the basis for a really good bed.
They must, however, the supplement blend to meet a particular user.
In selecting decided a lot of things, from weight, height, age, disability and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of restaurant, into which matrace rošt and buying.
A typical example?
At the weekend, where TV regularly netopí, are not suitable latexové matrace because zahřívají 'slowly'.
Moreover, they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard polyuretanová matrace.
At the same time, the case needs to be regularly turn up.
If they do not have a lot of odvzdušňovacích root in the heart, and even sits on the board of the firm, intercepted wetting: Could arise under them and blight.
In selecting also decides the habit.
Who spent a longer time in a foreign country, where it is often used to rank very high matrace změkčující, it is difficult to feel comfortable to be low, and with a hard surface.
"Perhaps all the players, who are returning from the NHL, complained to me that here nevyspí. '
'On their shoulders otlučená, heels and boky needed matrace the thick foam změkčující lazy'.
"This is to be recommended for people with diabetes, who have a disorder of the nervous system, so badly financial-guarantee, information 'from savings and skin," explains Hadamcziková restaurants, which specialises in čalouněný furniture.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers therefore years ago with matrace línou pěnou canvassing.
"Now this is in the humour, it has to be appropriate matrace Tempur, Italian, Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You do not have to be from the NHL borec to appreciate línou pěnu.
This "miracle" works simply.
Optimises its tuhost and shape according to absorbovaného heat or adjust your teplému body.
Nothing you standing in the night is not as převracet after a difficult game.
We are simply better vyspíte.
Lazy river also acts as a protection against proleženinami.
In choosing the size of its altitude matrace fold, even length chodidla, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of around 180 cm need Bed 210 to 220 height.
The minimum bandwidth for one should be for dvoulůžka 90 cm, together, 180 height.
In separate beds, for example, recommends singlistů at least 120 to 140 height.
For the comfort of a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule is simple: Bed for width in camps on the back you should be comfortably in the hands of a slightly pokrčené lokti," advised ING. Helena Prokopová, cechmistryně Cechu čalouníků and dekoratérů, which is the subject of a healthy sleep and ergonomie furniture pays for a number of years and delivers it to professional schools.
For dvoulůžka needs every own rošt and matraci, however, careful when buying, to reconcile matrací height.
Otherwise there would be nothing more than the Norway namontovat into different levels, however, you may not be able to each bed frame.
Pěnové matrace should have a height at least 14 cm, types with pružinovou backbone at least 15, with at least three of the century počítejte on tvarovací and kypřicí layer.
'When dotyku hands or landing at matraci pružiny you definitely feel, "warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrace requires a certain type of roštu.
Celočalouněná bed when matrace and grounds are as srostlá siamská twins have in ložnicích what to do.
Matrace badly větrají, can launder their potah, which is now commonplace.
And as for the night, normally vypotíme 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years, will start to resemble matrace one of the great (and jams) sítko.
That is why experts reject the advertising slogans about life matrací up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee.
All, however, is their but.
And that is why the Council of practice from vendors: Matrací latitude to 120 and 140 height of hygiene and snímatelný povlak do the job, but add a rather matracový chránič, which you can easily remove and launder.
Even though today routinely produce potahy matrací the zdrhovadly around the constituency, so after rozepnutí get two parts (for money, and the size of a washing machine, a lot of important!), yet could manipulation with larger types (and in one person in the fingerprinting Memorialized the lightweights in the ring with a heavy.
You are in bed instead roštu solid record?
Never!
A maximum of Bed designed to visit in one night.
Yet opatřete CD (if not already) větracími to sit and use matraci with pružinovou backbone and altitude at least 15 cm with pružinami in bags (from něm.Taschenfederkern) and kypřicí layer.
Polyuretanová matrace on this basis do not.
At nepolohovací lamelové Norway with 14 to 18 lamelami will appropriate latexové or sendvičové matrace (a combination latexu and kokosu), but always pays you Norway, with a greater number of lamel, 28, and more, are in the area where lamely the shoulders of the twin and it is possible their tuhost to regulate.
At polohovací lamelové non-LDCs matrace Norway with pružinovou backbone because polohování unresponsive.
In addition to setting tuhosti lamel you can afford, and the so-called ramenní the cradle.
It is a special embed lamel, which allows force, or even win lamelu so that the arm 'zabořilo spáče much'.
For men who are 'shoulders across the whole of the back, "definitely important thing.
Even to remember even matrací manufacturers who, in 'pánských' start using změkčující zone in the area.
The women also remember - those, in turn, enjoy a softer surface hip in places.
For the most demanding customers are addressed křidélkové or destičkové Norway with so-called multitorzním pérováním.
Pressure was disintegrating into more points and reducing tensions.
However, be careful when using the right matraci and rošt bad cushion (great and 'naducaný "), most of the' plus' will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: Cushion to buttress the head and heads only intervene to ramenům to be able to mobilise ramenní muscles.
As the appropriate size recommends 50 x 60 cm, which show that, for example, in Scandinavia.
In camps on the side should cushion to cope (along with ramenní roštu změkčenou cradle or zone matraci ramene) in height.
Modern matrace have with the original slamníky plněnými travinami, after all, something in common.
Their producers, are increasingly using natural materials or at least the ingredients.
The trend is also simply for matrací organic.
Raw materials from oil, from which the produce polyuretanové foam are replaced, for example, from the natural oils skočce and soya.
Soybean is used by all manufacturers are known for.
'Organic for matrací means that the core of the material it is made from a purely natural origin, "explains Peter Vašíček from firms Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are used in the production of potahů matrací, one of the first was the aloe Vera.
But you can also take you to mikrokapsle uvolňovala fresh smell of burnt or levandule.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men 'cooling' vegetable extrakt from břízy to potah matrace labour heat and cooler body, women potahy "awash" on the contrary.
Extrakt from red papriček increasing the circulation of blood so that the weaker sex is cooler.
Today's favorites?
Matrace made from Cold foam (has greater póry with porušenou cell structure is so prodyšnější than ordinary polyuretan and offers better elasticitu.
A combination of hot tuhostí pěn and 'lazy' foaming arise vícezónové matrace to know exactly where it should be a head, shoulders and toes.
Matraci pay for the quality and the seven thousand kronor and levels.
Those that meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as medical equipment.
First made in the Czech Republic on this advantage Gumotex.
Save on matraci and roštu is not easy.
Sometimes it can be used to the actions of the producers or retailers who offer two matrace for the price of one.
The Magniflex label offers matraci Duofreeze the všitou paměťovou pěnou clinics in potahu for 11 990 kronor.
The second but you can already get free.
The era of líných or viskoelastických pěn with an open cell structure and a high density of unleashing 'space' pace Tempur material.
Originally created as a material for NASA, because they were exposed to the enormous congestion startech astronauts.
Tempur in warm softening in chladnu bolsters the contrary.
Teplému the human body is so perfectly adapt and dismantles his optimum pressure.
It is therefore the ideal against the emergence of proleženin, but also to increase comfort in their sleep.
Foam Viskoelastické are used not only for matrace, but also on health products, such as a special cushion under the feet that odlehčují feet and žilnímu system.
Manufacturers use pěnu Eucatherm capability for example, C or Twinsaver and the like.
Machines to monitor people want to ever more parents, they want so uhlídat their children.
Fear for their own child still brings more people to the idea of conducting via GPS.
The system initially calls for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people and aid in such cases, such as the disappearance of a nine-year-old Aničky Janatkové.
Equipment is about as big a pack from sirek soon, but it may be great just like clockwork.
A number of people disappeared Aničky terrorized case and started the quest for resources to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that this is not a spy, but on another vehicle to reduce the likelihood that it will be a tragedy," says Peter wood from society Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment for the Czech market.
"I admit that, in some cases, lead to the abuse of such facilities, as when in bags, to someone who knows more about this, but we have not seen such a case".
"The majority of customers are buying is really for security reasons," add wood.
According to him, would always child should know to what purpose '' serves as a pack and is used in an emergency.
Child psycholožka Dan Bočková draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear anything similar, just to be rid of.
"Even very small children are showing great creativity in how some things set to lose if they do not want to be under control. '
The 'great expectations previously worked with the parents, but phones give off, as well as the monitoring equipment, "says Bočková.
It is also questionable whether, in the event of attack really helped facilities.
"When it comes to the forthcoming kidnapping, criminal virtually always ensure that a child should be no electronics, which could reveal his location.
"Now it is a phone."
"When we begin to expand surveillance equipment, will also look at it because their sale will be backed up by a massive advertising."
"In this case, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psycholožka.
He acknowledges, however, that such devices can help in the event of a sudden attack pedofilem.
According to Robert himself from society RC monitoring, which provides surveillance services for cars and for the people, even in the event after the attack to immediately destroy the satellite equipment can help his presence.
"Devices can be set for regular send location after a certain period of time."
"If the damage will be available, at least, the location of the person concerned."
'Expensive facilities are built and náklonometry, so even if a person only uklouzl nehybně and remained on the ground, it will send a warning device immediately with udáním location, "says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can do and smart mobile phones with navigací where you download and special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either on the machines similar přívěskům size from sirek packs or smaller mobile phones.
Always so their loss.
According to Pilina Macro from Weil, so innocent-looking facilities now being tested as a normal digital watches.
"This will have the greatest advantage that potential aggressor not monitoring equipment at all. '
'Or eating, after some time and it can give police extra time, "he adds.
Whatever monitoring devices evolve into náramků or přívěsků, will continue to use the same technology, which is used to leave their vehicles.
It is a combination of the caller location through GPS system (which use ordinary autonavigace) and functions of a mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle.
The army has zápalných banks that obmotaly the Czech Republic, but only the last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres banks which launched explosives.
Already last year, the Department of Defense has given stores to 224 miles to the banks.
The army has reserves of 225 years.
The problem is that life is two banks, a maximum of four years.
The army bought zápalné cord from stock STV Group Inc. for 40 million kronor.
The General Staff of the rationale for the purchase of such a huge amount of zápalných banks today, MF wrote that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres zápalnic year.
Calculations pyrotechniků from the military, which has approached today, MF, however, shows that it would be very intensive pyrotechnickým training had to go every year and all the generals, officers command of the army, secretaries or cleaners.
The defense minister and head of the army of Alexander Vondra Vlastimila Picka included.
That is the only way we could justify the annual consumption of army 60 kilometres zápalnic.
This is in line with the length of the 25,000 eruptions.
And even if this was the case, the army should vystačily for more than ten years.
If true, that would be contrary to basic training each new professional look at the most two metres zápalné cord, say experts, as well as the army to ensure fresh buying - even with the increased consumption of ženijních or Special Forces - stocks on the 225 years.
Soldiers rapid deployment of brigades, Minister Vondra personally complained recently that they have almost no ammunition for small arms, so are the shootings because of the need for money is reduced.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"To me it is also the head of the rides that they buy from us repeatedly so many zápalnic. '
"But it is their decision, and I certainly know what they will be."
"For us, the army has been a good customer, as traders trying to accommodate," says the commercial manager John Děcký STV Group.
A spokesman for the Department of Defense John Pejšek hundreds of miles to a string of packages that the army will have reserves of this' ammunition 'for at least ten years.
John Děcký from STV Group, however, talk only of a four-year life zápalnice and police or army pyrotechnici even just two years.
"In a perfect storage it may be those four," says one of them, as a soldier, because of criticism of the military does not want to disclose the name.
After a lifetime of any ammunition must be carefully tested, whether it is still reliable and endangers the lives of troops.
These tests, however, are not free and cost more money.
Another argument Ministry is quantitative discount on 445 kilometres zápalných banks.
'Cost us about 60% less than last year's dismal two hundred 44 miles, "spokesman Pejšek nákupčích convey the position of the Department of Defense.
Just for comparison: Annual consumption of launchers police pyrotechniků banks who destroy munitions from the Second World War, following the Soviet army or exceed 1 500 metres for several years.
And the police intend to always only the amount of the ammunition used up before the end of the cycle.
Worked with it for the sake of security, and can tailor pyrotechniků in addition to modern and, therefore, more reliable types of banks.
The Ministry of Defence has already considerable difficulties with the removal of the tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the Warsaw Pact, when Czechoslovakia's army was preparing to drive completely on the Rhine.
The Czech pyrotechniků according to which today, MF approached waiting for a couple of years of the same problem: It will dispose of hundreds of miles of old zápalnic, which today 'cheap' purchases.

'My name is vystrčeno to the fore, "he says, modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successor calmer year than we had in Farmetu
The euphoria of victory, quickly gave way to the effects of the crisis.
Thanks, however, is the winner of the cílevědomosti Farmet worse times in a row.
For the price for the first place in the competition last year Vodafone firm, last year in the house owner Slovanském concluded that firms Farmet, Karl Žďárský.
The jury then appreciate the efforts through which built from a small nástrojářské workshops in the Czech Skalici company with stamilionovými turnovers.
"I can tell you that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my collaborators and increased self-confidence us to struggle with competition," he says today, last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of the firms Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered father Karl Žďárského to rent one small dílničku as compensation for property seized by the Communists, long hesitated, refused to a career in the company, where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his táty a firm on plastic bathtub.
Shortly later, started to specialise in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years of them become the largest manufacturer of automatic lisů in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among neodbornou public after the company achieved success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to see the brand Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that work with the company, which has been in the greater the success of their country," says Karl Žďárský.
Last year, however, has not been the only sign of the euphoria in Farmetu vítězsví.
The award was based on the economic results in 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of Industries of goods.
During the height of the crisis, which is still so few citizens, but companies already stops its investment projects, and began to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation is, of course, no, nor us. '
'Sales have fallen by 40%, we have had to cut back production and even on fire, "explains Charles Žďárský.
Viable company must be able to do that and sometimes unpopular measures.
But the situation and the company managed to maintain a profit, even if a smaller than it was before the crisis.
What, however, is in Farmetu neslevili investment in research and development.
"Subsidies have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened the presentation on international fairs, received the award in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with them, the number of new employees.
New winners' I wish a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere, "Karl vzkazuje Žďárský.
Anketa, which removes the pointless legislation.
Anketa on the absurdity of the year is the fourth part of the race.
Some pointless legislation has already been abolished.
Neslavným winner the next year also the absurdity of the year has become a duty to wear Office documents that officials are also available online.

Thanks to anketě this to change.
'Česká social security administration already statement from the commercial register in checks to taxpayers will require insurance, "said spokesman John Buraňová ČSSZ.
We looked at all the rules and regulations that must firms and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic to play, and the absurd to lift the competition is the point of absurdity of the year.
This is the fourth part of the race earlier this year by the economic newspapers and the public are becoming more popular.
If the vote were last about three thousand voters, earlier this year, there were nearly four thousand.
And not surprisingly, the various statutory obligation, which only serves to delay business is with us still.
"To be in the number of pages of tax returns, we are at the top of the world," notes Karl Havlíček of the Association to small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses in the Czech Republic.

Compared with the rest of the world, but in the Czech Republic, in particular, the situation is not improving.
According to the World Bank, with the Czech Republic in terms of conditions for business ranks 74. position that is eight points worse off than last year.
The absurdity of the year competition was first declared in 2006, and each year follows the same script.

Sent off entrepreneurs, but also professional unions and journalists.
Between 'retains the competition between occupy "so, for example, found the requirement that vehicles on the highway and speed roads to pay tolls or to entrepreneurs with 20 employees in two offices and two toilets painted every two years.
The list of this year's sedmičky is published on the websites of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which is always the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, which is part of the hapenningu regularly attend the personality of the political and social life.
This year, for example, at this point of the competition asistovala Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses of the Czech Republic or Peter Kužel Economic Association, the president of the Czech Republic.
'Economic prosperity cannot function where become entrepreneurs lumps wheel, so it is my aim to abolish every year, at least three dozen paragraphs, which now only unnecessarily complicated business, "he told the trade and industry minister Martin Kocourek.
The effort to jam the pointless regulations nevyznívá flat.
In 2007 the people most entrepreneurs vadila duty to report three days ahead živnostenskému office in a place where it is placed in permanent place, the intention to go to for an exhibition booth, or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed živnostenského 2000 law.

The story of each of them is a very inspiring and gave it to a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities one from the other, diametrically opposed the common denominator for their efforts to support and consideration.
In one case concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere to personal problems or the health of its employees.
Among the 14 celorepublikovými retains finds itself, for example, the Prague software firm ET Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among the employees, who were then involved in a number of sponsorship in different sports.
Another example of the responsible firms from Pardubického Prešov Isolit-Bravo, the company, which is the main backer of the seventeen years nadačního fund sponzorujícího disabled children.
Their disabled employees, old papírna from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 per cent, and therefore gained the title responsible firms Středočeského agro-energy and Vodafone in the competition of the year, the company placed in the region as the third.

At Pozemkovém Fund in Plzni police zatýkala in a public competition.
In building Pozemkového Fund in Plzni zatýkala Workd in recent days by the police.
Crushing detektivové modest local entrepreneurs in media sphere and dealer with real Luboši G.
He reportedly tried to manipulate the public competition to deal of restitution claims to plot offered concrete bidders in the competition.
He had for G. Luboši to pay half a million kronor.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for misdemeanours pletichy in a public tender and in public competition law," said Romer plzeňského state prosecurot Antonie Green that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation, cannot provide.
Entrepreneurs Šestačtyřicetiletého Y-Tao released after 24 hours of freedom.
About how it could affect public competition can be given low official information only speculate.
Spokeswoman Pozemkového fund Lubomíra Montenegro to the question of Children, said that in the workplace in Plzni odloučeném Y-Tao actually broadcast, during a public competition.
'It was a client, not our employees' specificity.
A public competition, according to the title of 'Join the right to make an offer to transfer land claims in the law of the land "and is being held in the case when a plot of land offered wishes more legitimate asylum seekers.
'These people within the challenges offer higher value of their restitution claims, which have to be addressed by converting than the value of the property was vyhlašovaná.'
"According to the claims of states offered seriatim nabyvatelů and then turn a plot of land Fund, which offered high demands," explained the spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. probably should have information who have signed up to the challenges, and because he is also justified the person as restitution claims, offered to discover a number of candidates on a plot of land that the competition will not be attending.
For this apparently inkasoval severance payments.
This would account for the fact that he was in detention as large a sum of money.
G. Luboš non-utilisation had contacts in the Zanu in Plzni in the past.
In the case of the former leader of Zanu Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing in spare land restitution, which has already been issued a decision on the location of the construction.
Just then gained Luboš G. from the Fund, for example, of the land earmarked for the construction of public communications, particularly in a place where we should build příjezdová magistrála into industrial zones Borská field.
Later is very conveniently směnil with magistrátem for the house in the historic center of the city, which was the value of the much higher.
At that time, the city had to move, because, otherwise, by blocking the construction of the land.
Households on housing připlatí hundreds of the month.
Households will have to post since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for the charges and stočné, the supply of heat and somewhere to grow and tenants.
The family will have to pull from January from the purses of up to hundreds of kronor per month, more than we do now.
Expensive electricity up to 4.6%, gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, up to a tenth of that in some cities will have to post for water supply and also restricting podraží the supply of central heating.
Electricity prices should households in homes come on stokoruny more than a year now.
The price of the electricity at the same time, all the major suppliers have reduced to blame, so it is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, particularly in photovoltaics.
Gas is slightly more expensive but, in a time when most people drowning and have such high consumption.
Annually must also reckon with hundreds of kronor.
While electricity and gas will push across the Republic, the change in the central heating is different place from the spot.
Price increases are mainly greater community.
For example, households in Pardubicích or Hradci kings pay since January as the central heating about 50 kronor per month in addition to the more than 1,000 kronor a year for families in Liberci.
The people of Prague, in turn, threatens to them about more than 9 per cent more expensive and stočné, and charges in the case, that the city will increase the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent will change, připlatí Pražené to 6.8 per cent.
Price in Prague, however, it will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between lower.
In the north, where the Czechs now prices are among the highest, the charges and stočné podražit by 7.4 per cent.
Significantly, for example, may rise in the price of rent in 450 inhabited by hundreds of thousands of apartments, where from January to the end of regulation.
For example, the company CPI, which in the flats above Labem own about 2,500 homes since January, intends to rent increase of up to 100 per cent.
Those who do not agree with the new levels of rent, it intends to give the company to court.
Regulated tenants, which applies to people in approximately 300 thousands of apartments, next year could rise by up to 10 per cent.
The Czech children fernetem rumem home and is going out of fashion. Pivo 1955 slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and whisky label, exceptionally better ukradená parents.
These are drinks, which ends after taking most often in the care of doctors trying, which has not yet been or fifteen years.
The exception, not the children that the monkeys treated in hospital again.
This stems from the experiences of doctors who are faced with similar cases on the revenue department of children's hospitals.
"Any beer or wine are totally nemódní, because it takes a long time to opijete them. '
"The trend is certainly tough alcohol," Law told primář Delinking Hořovice children's hospitals in the medium-sized Kolín Luděk Pelikán.
"If they can get a bottle of tatínkovi from cupboards, so it must be about the whisky, but otherwise dominates fernet and vodka '.
'Vodka has the advantage that it pour into the juice and not so many of them feel,' explained primář.
For the right, and he also gives the hospital spokeswoman Fakultní Motol Eva Jurinová.
"This is not the most fernet or rum."
"This is today a modern alcohol, particularly in primary schools.
"In some cases it was about, which is produced from slivovici home, 'said Jurinová.
According to primáře Pelikána are 13 or čtrnáctiletí pijáci at the hospital income relatively commonplace.
Before Hořovicemi, where acts from this year, has worked for 10 years on antidepressant in Motole where ambulances svážejí podroušené schoolchildren from a broad region.
"One girl lay about four for us. '
'Career began in 12 years when it brought to us with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in their blood, in combination with extází described the doctor, "particularly serious case.
"Was výstavišti in Holešovicích for any dance soprano."
"Interestingly, her mother had no special that their daughter did 48 hours," the ashes primář.
It is of interest to parents or even their considerable tolerance towards popíjení own offspring, is considered to be the main cause of the growing baby pijanství.
The addiction in the true sense of the word, but according to experts, for children to be.
"The concept of an alcoholic is the lowest chronic dependency on alcohol all phenomena that belong to children, and it is not."
'For those that alcohol use repeatedly, often rather symptomatic of a failed rodinně-sociální background, "explained primář Pelikán.
Jurinové this year, according to the spokesman of the pediatric clinic in Motole hospitalizovali by the middle of November, roughly 40 opilých children.
The statistics, however, they will receive only those with severe intoxikací, who had to stay in hospital.
Child trying following ambulantním treatment odvezou parents or is shipped home of the police, will not count.
Except when children after school just sit and drink a bottle of kořalky, there are three seasonal fluctuations in Pelikána which can count: Witch-hunters Silvestr, and the end of the school year.
"Either drink sorrow from the wrong school, or, on the contrary, hailed the beginning of a holiday."
"Witch, I experienced on income and seven children suddenly opilců, 'said Pelikán.
Opilec detoxikací spent the night under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, is at an advantage compared to that on the second day at home vytrpí painful hangover.
In the morning, the head of the pain caused by dehydration and lack of glucose that satisfies zavodňovací infusions with glukózou and nutrients, which lacks the organism.
"They are actually better off, as they have for a beautiful evening experience and good awakening and nothing is more pain '.
"Not only are the confusion of where they are," admitted Pelikán that sometimes fails to patients in a pleasant mood, at least, a list of the costs, the cost of their treatment.
Transportation and emergency admissions for acute bed, is also in the tens of thousand kronor.
"Sometimes I have to use this as a learning tool, when I directly to those children then vizitě calculated how much their drunkenness, and that could also spend the entire summer on a brigade to earn the one party, 'add Pelikán.
Health insurance, however, according to him, in which management regresním after parents enforce the cost of treatment, in cases of child opilců scandals.
Two aircraft L-159 are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159 total of five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defence is overthrown Casa C-295M transport plane, Tuesday odletěly into Spanish Sevilly where aircraft manufacturer - EADS Casa.
This is the first time that this type of machines were owned by someone other than the Czech army.
Abroad has only been on the exercises or předváděcích years.
This is a decimal version L-159T1, which has led the Czech army and which were letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are jednomístné L-159.
Yet it is in those zakonzervované Aeru Vodochody and broker trade - firm Omnipol - is already taken over the last week.
When aircraft from Vodochod is not physically sports according to John Pejška from the Department of Defense press yet known.
'Jednomístné aircraft L-159 have been earmarked for conversion from the aircraft, and it is the long term imposed without further deposits and investments from the home ministry.
'The decimal L-159T1 be converted in the current shape and form, "said law Pejšek.
He added that the military planes left without dvoumístných because the department in May 2009 with Aerem Vodochody signed a contract in the $200 million kronor on the rebuilding of the four unnecessary machines L-159 to two decimal machines.
One new plane was taken over by the army in July, the second will take until the end of this year.
According to EADS Pejška committed that aircraft weaponry to enforce some NATO countries.
"It is clearly stated in the Treaty that buyer of aircraft L-159 company is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries'.
"It is therefore things odběratele how this thing will implement Pejšek," he said.
Economic newspaper recently reported that, for example, the Spanish army on L-159 no interest.
Five L-159 exchange for one plane Casa and buy three other planes for 3.5 billion kronor last year, the government approved Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence to buy nevypsalo tender and addressing directly EADS.
The leadership of the defence argument by exchanging support future exports L-159 abroad.
The Czech army from Aera bought 72 machines and uses only 24, the rest would sell.
Casa will probably buy aircraft and the aftermath.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence is moved for the European Court, therefore, that the aircraft should choose on the basis of a pan-European tendru and not addressing one of the producers.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa last should at the Prague airport Kbely land in a fortnight.
Fingers longer than prsteníček marks a lower risk of cancer.
The men, who have more than our fingers prsteníček are less exposed to the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
That is the startling conclusion of the study, which was published Wednesday in the British journal of cancer.
This may relate to the level of the male hormone testosteronu.
"Our results show that the relative finger length can serve as a simple test the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men in 60 years," said study co-author Ros Eelesová, professor of cancer research at the Institute for Government in the University.
Finger and could help identify men who should undergo a test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk threatening or other factors such as family health burden, add Eelesová.
In a period of 1994-2009 monitor with colleagues in Britain more than 500 patients with prostate cancer and in parallel over three thousands of healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the fingers on right hand shorter than prsteníček.
For them to apply the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 per cent of those whose fingers are just as long.
In the case of those who had fingers longer than prsteníček, however, this risk has fallen by 33 per cent for men to šedesátky even 87 percent, the decline.
The ratio of the length of two of these fingerprints - built in the prenatal period - probably reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosteronu Community-minded prolonged ukazováčku.
Previous research has shown that it supports the muscle-bound growing prostate cancer.
Leading Czech genetik and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that this study briefly knows, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingerprints and cancer was "quite clear".

A new weapon is something as small superpřesné happened.
The bullets that takes precision laser with a few metres.
Special bullets to 25 mm gun, developed for this gun and containing highly explosive explosives, effectively operate as small grenades.
Bullets can be a quantum that vybuchnou only in crashed into the goal, but any point in its ballistic career.
It is, therefore, can be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, behind a wall or in zákopu.
From the top, is usually protected, and when he bears the murderous rain steel Chinese, it can remove it from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, who was involved in the development of the XM-25 is a new gun the first weapons for the infantry, which uses' smart 'technology.
"Soldier with it basically goes so that a goal to send him a laser beam, which will determine the distance and gets upřesněný deliberate point, according to him and squeeze assistance-based náměr tap."
"Let us say that you naměřili 543 meters."
'When stisknete the trigger, the gun fired a missile at the nabije ultraperipherality 543 metres of plus or minus one, two or three metres, "Audette said.

Online activists used in the publication of secret diplomatic cables Amazon Web Service (AWS), in order to cope with the high number of approaches to the documents.
Through services to explain Twitter to Wikileaks: 'Fine - now we spend our dollars by zaměstnáme people in Europe. "
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, 'then I would have to stop selling the book'.
Amazon to stop the use of their servers for Wikileaks after aides said Senator Joe Lieberman carried out the research, published by the television channel CNN, on the basis of the information office Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee on defence has threatened to boycott the home base, to inform the British 'Guardian'.
"I would have wished that Amazon started to do this before, given earlier by publishing classified information to WikiLeaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for the US and other countries to prevent the platform in the use of the sites.

From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech bit archaic zmrzlinář, the sun produces all of the rules, according to the Italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio vyndá stěrkou ice cream from boxing chladícího setře it into a cake, and sells.
This, you see, you do not have to go to the Anzola dell 'Emilio in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about zmrzlině, he escapes the 'Gelato-University' Italian firms Carpigiani.
In 2003 it established producers zmrzlinových machines zmrzlinovou university to zmrzlina of his machinery fit everywhere high-flux Italian ideals.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasted three days, it is a huge interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
But Taiwan also offers special rates on chocolate zmrzlině and observed in their own zmrzlinárně.
Someone yearning in its Midlife-Crisis for a new career, others dare to the thin ice of their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all continents - from Brazil via Hungary after Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a teacher from California, loves art movement Slow-Food and I would in future offer high-quality European product industrial Ice-Cream in the country.
Anke from Berlin is corporate konzultantka, I would like to work for the years spent stressful start something of their own.
Two young Egyptian dreaming that in Kairu zmrzlinárnu open.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil, want to improve the quality of the ice in their bars - and Canadian woman in households Julia arrived, because her children love the Italian ice cream.
The entire Maestro-Gelatiere Ferrari first participants explain the ideal features stunning cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also of the Silk hebkost and good consistency.
Forget the entire during his training on jižanskou and patriotic icing on the cake: 'Italian Gelato is simply the best - and that includes even a good dose of romantiky.'
The first step in the production seems to be pretty simple.
Throw the entire basic ingredients, skimming milk, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers into the great mixéru that warmer everything electronic programme to 85 degrees and then immediately cool to four degrees.
Then turn on the machine and tap Gulf pasterizovaný basic white lotion, the foundation of all types of milk zmrzlin.
Rochester is immediately zasypán issues: It is possible to produce only ice cream from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can the man himself experiment?
The entire warns, to be carried away by the spirit of the time in the dark.
Who talk about zmrzlině 'only natural ingredients', probably as stabilizers used - mostly natural product such as guarová roll from guarových zrnek.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must sell during one day, otherwise we will bring the same ice and the customer her grain.
Some variation of the basic costs are leave.
Napínavější it will be with the aromatic esencemi.
Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream in the entire volume, which buy in a supermarket in the department with either fruit or sweets in the department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatised nanosubstances. '
"But you should simply experiment."
Either with dessert sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or zmrzlinou of white matter, which is a fundamental change to the yellow vajíčky lotion and kakaem the basis for všelijaká vitamin-supplemented temptation.
Now the participants can rate zmrzlinovým to you.
The entire head is always produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, tea and lískooříškové egg cream - either with or without them in fundamental matter, with more or less vanilkovým properties or other natural přísadami.
There will be the same experiment with dessert types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pyré - given the taste is not always better.
Lískooříšková zmrzlina chutnat oříšková not more, when more lískových contains nuts.
Favorite ice cream from the kiwi produce group, which uses less water, and more fruit, little less stabilizer.
Only when properly balanced mixture of things taste Gelato, says the entire.
Production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If fori peaches pyré with a lot of sugar, reduce the share of sugar in the basic recipe.
In the portion of the ice is the need for extra sugar.
The entire vyndá device, which determines the sugar in fruit (vine-growers measured by wine from grapes).
Tables fortunately, the numbers of the illness.
Cream production already require physical effort so much as it was before.
Not only for the automatic machine production of basic fuel.
There is also the device, which is a mixture of zmrzlinovou umíchá krému and cool at the same time, the temperature at minus.
Despite all the automatizaci Evasions small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo get himself and his colleagues from the top down to ovocným pyré, when he gets out of control, a huge mixér.
"In any rate, considers the entire 'Maestro', it is only a question of time when this happens. '
In the light of the controllers double
The EFSA is intertwined with the food industry, which has experimented with genetic plants.
This accusation has now voiced Testbiotech group of experts, which considers itself the independent Institute for estimate of biotechnology.
"This sounds contrived theory, but we are well documented," he said Wednesday in Munich boss Christoph Testbiotechu Then.
The leading group of experts concluded for gentechnicky transformed plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert EFSA have several years of the contract, the union lobbyists Ilsi.
It is funded by the concerns as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was involved in a decisive way to control legislation EFSA for genetic plants and is in clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
EFSA said the rules are the same in whole paragraphs, with documents Ilsi and a script so industry, which should be controlled by Parma in Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech draws attention to the conflicts of interest.
Recently transferred high secretary from EFSA without EUROPASS or transitional period the Swiss group Syngenta agrárnímu - and the party has changed.
Also radio for Central Germany (MDR) recently revealed personnel links EU-úřadu for control with the industrial lobby, which has aroused the interest of both the Department for the Environment, as members of the EU.
In the meantime, the EFSA cannot identify a conflict of interest.
Working with all the seriousness of the data, as well as those of the industry, as long as they are highly professional quality, it said in a statement.
From the experts who work for the EFSA, are not required to have contacts with the industry.
They must also be proven.
Kuiper admits his work for International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from the science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without Treaty lobbyists.
Independent experts as Then criticise that are currently leave gentechnicky transformed plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and the response of plants to netestuje genetic effects of the environment.
"We want to know what to do, for example, changed gentechnicky corn in the field," said Then.
Current practice is only testing isolated proteins and not the entire genetic expelled, which nedoloží reliable results.
"If inflation risks, how could it be, then it is possible to find? 'Asks žalobně Then.
He agrees and Angelika Hilbeck.
Scientific researchers examining gentechniku since 1994 and is currently working on a technical high school in Zurich.
In this area, the industry is trying to do as well as in the US, now also in Europe, more and more influence or discredit critical scientists.
This is why almost there are scientists who are not connected with the concerns.
Mostly nepublikují studies, which are critical for the company.
"Industry controls the security research ', believes Hilbeck.
Footprint of
Uli Gsell also some acquired a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, before nádražím in Stuttgart, tubu on the back.
The demonstrations.
Sněžilo.
The story is familiar: In September and started taking busloads of tearing a great deal of northern wing.
In Stuttgart the world has been the same: Thousands demonstrate against S21, miliardovému reduce the station.
When a halt to construction, dropped most of the wing in ruins.
To fix 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Vápenec from Crailsheimu, soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years.
Secured several of these pieces.
"These blocks are relikvie. '
Not 'disappear'.
The hubris: 'Cheap and poor, simple stone and founding. "
When one rozřízl, smrděl after cigarette smoke.
What with those pieces will do not know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
Footprint of the cornerstones of the Stuttgart leads to forest in Tübingen in a former munitions deponii the French army, where Manuel Rongen establish its stonework empire.
44-letý man traded on old stones.
Buy all incurred during the collapse in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if, rozemlely on štěrk or disappeared on deponii ', says in her office, wooden booth, which was previously a guard house.
Tells him and threatened him when nadávali in September in all the newspapers that bought the remnants of a northern wing from the society, which is carrying out the demolition.
But he spoke of the whole days with adversaries S-21.
And explain to them that the demolition cannot at all.
And when that happens, then it is reasonable, when stones continue to use it.
Then I took some 200 S-21-protivníků each one about 80 kilograms heavy bloc, the price for a piece of 6,50 up to 14 the euro.
As memory, some also in the hope that it will come back in the building.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes of cargo, 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest have long sold.
Gardeners krajinní zahradníci, home builders.
They have come from all corners and odtáhli what kufru přívěs and to fit in.
Stones from Stuttgart dispute had to be transformed into 'zídky' or as a fringe záhonů with bylinkami.
"This stone is actually nothing special, 'says Rongen.
"If it were not for the political vsuvky. '
Nasedá into his SUV and car on the roller-coaster rides after his 20-ti hektarovém UK.
Studied law, first off, the study of biology, then later took on the computer, and eventually became a trader with stones.
And milovníkem blocks.
My reposited 40000 tonnes of blocks.
Its treasures collected from all over Germany.
She says that it is the largest trader of old stones in the Republic.
Back.
In the snow lies umělecky opracované pískovce.
'Once belonged to Marien-most in Dresden, "tonight.
Pískovec from Ukraine, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
'My favourite stone'.
We are going to continue on the path up through the forest.
It shows a pile, before the Red pískovec: Part of the depot in Karlsruhe.
And on.
Travertin 'fine'.
One of those at the forum were kvádry Neckarstadionu in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories Cannstatt-travertin of the Presidium of the police in Stuttgart, Red granit of the St. Blasien, tuf from hospitals in Heilbronnu.
What kind of work worthwhile, what the sweat.
When Rongen thinks, as before, the bureau rozbíjely stones and carrying through simple kladkostrojů and bullfighting povozů, it will become completely respectful.
"This would be a scandal if this drtilo. '
To become rich, very rich, not at all.
Trader with stones but today employs 14 people, and in addition, the seated kameníci up in the forest, a sculptor, one kovář, one sklář and one zahradník.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfying," says someone who appreciates residues.
In the foreseeable future, to Cologne.
There also will be to rescue the stones.
The battle of talent on High-potenciály
The food is a lot of people.
16 students are pushing for chlebíčků with lososem, rajčatové soup and sweets.
Technical university in Braunschweigu and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students engineering and design at the workshop.
Along with software firms VW here have to talk about the car of the future - and the only way to get to know the way Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to race in the cleverest the head of the company, as well as VW to succeed and betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to: As soon as possible to recruit in posluchárnách talented graduates, even before they get to the labour market and will be of interest to others.
Since universities print no lists of the success of its students, are trying to discover the extraordinary talent companies in projects to practice and to get it.
The Braunschweig motor concern is trying to win the talent on the second day.
One young lady from personal department gives propiska, rubber medvídky and plates with the VW logo.
Tells budding young talents of programmes on the practice, student employment and suggests they travel to the group.
Nico Selle from the Braunschweig it is concerned about the project, together with VW.
See the benefits for both sides: "Students are in contact with the industry and gain experience. '
'VW can tell the students at the same time, closer to familiarise themselves with some interesting candidates and twice who could be described as an associate of'.
Such cooperation, according to Selle, are not unusual.
But the news is that it is so openly struggling students.
"Otherwise, it was a rather substantial technical project, 'says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, the firms no longer be able to select their employees from long field of candidates.
On the contrary, we must try and try to entice particularly highly skilled workforce.
Graduates engineering disciplines have excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German engineers VDI in October remained unfilled 40,000 engineering positions.
And, according to forecasts, VDI so-called lack of engineers have to rise.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG is Roman Dykta hunting talent.
By demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, the type of modern race for treasure, in which participants must find a way to GPS koordinát.
Next year, the company plans to send eight such promising students after the US.
Participants can also see branches KPMG and to familiarise themselves with the firm.
Advance in two rounds of competitions to determine who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from the number of people flying to the US.
In the competition for high Potentials at universities will pay under Dykty still tougher laws.
"We want to be with our race to distinguish itself from other '.
"A simple trip to the sailor was, for us, the power of the few '.
It seems that lovec talent Dykta has been lucky.
"We have remained in contact with all of the participants in the similar actions in the past year. '
"Some will soon finish the study and planning for us to aspire to work," he says.
In addition to direct media on Campus, particularly small and medium-sized firms themselves apart in labour markets.
"We are trying to make contact with graduates at specialist exhibitions."
'Such as the Intersolar, "says Sitha Stübe, the leading manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld department staffing.
From Bonn in Germany, the company employs around 1,500 workers.
Stübe knows the issues with the young workers.
It is currently called 35 positions on the websites of companies.
"At the present time it is difficult to fill vacant jobs. '
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact via professors at universities.
Solarworld is cooperating with the various high schools, such as the university in Freibergu.
"Teachers are reporting that it is possible for us to practice or write diplomovou work. '
Solar Specialist does no expensive advertising action.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: Personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
The 'great concerns that often cannot offer, "says a leading personal Delinking Stübe.
In search of work for a long time to play the role of the money.
Flexible working hours, looked after children or good options procedure are other factors at play.
Solarworld occupied in one study of the Great Place to Work Institute 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws the annual list of the best of the German employers.
In addition, the aides questioning how they are satisfied with their work, and the working environment and watching the framework conditions of employees.
Leading personal Delinking Stübe hopes that it will bring the points with bids for the work.
"I believe that the bidder is informed, especially on external assessments of potential employers," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
Advising its customers to be more autentičtí.
And, according to Mr Krieglera this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to raise the profile of an attractive employer runs through its own employees," he says.
Technically, this is called the internal Employer Branding, the enforcement of the employer on the market within their own employees.
'Happy employees are the best ambassadors. "
When a company well cares for its people and they identify with the firm, then they themselves do advertising their employers among friends and acquaintances.
"This is a game with provázkem," said Kriegler.
Obama brings new oil drilling
During the next few years there will be a coastal US-spolkového the state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico to the new oil drilling.
The government in Washington issued a ban - and thereby abolishing definitively earlier plans.
Also from the Atlantic coast are still banned new drilling.
The Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, said Wednesday.
The reason for this strict ban, which would have to pay at least the next five years, the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon vrtné "tower" in April.
Before the accident, which cost the lives of 11 workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled to pressure the opposition, and the industry is its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates by trying to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clearly explained, who bears responsibility for a devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism of the British energetic Karmann BP, which faced owing requests.
A Commission of Inquiry, appointed by Obama, should produce results during December.
In October, the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar drilling ban, which has been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently offered various oil concerns applications for new vrtné intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to avoid a similar disaster stricter controls and strict safety regulations.
Currently, fundamentally reform the supervisory authority that the attention of many of the corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he will waive the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas concerns.
The industry now openly warned that tougher regulation, reduce the amount of oil produced in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest impediment to the growth of the gas and oil industry," is the result of a recent survey of the industry consulting firm BDO - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance even to think about the uncertainty in the industry: 'Nobody knows exactly what the regulation will change'.
Investment in new mining projects until the appeal place - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni burnt
Water in rivers is olejově brown, this stinks like the pump: Billion litres of oil uniklé destroyed nature in the Ogoni in Nigeria.
People living illegally, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
'Netrapte', reassuring journalist green activist: 'Today, you will receive a objektiv still enough oil mess. "
37-letý Nigeriánec followed the attempt by registering the boy who, after wading prsa water flanked by šmouhy: The scene is in water colors luster with duhovými almost up nicely.
That, beneath the surface, swimming lignite-fuelled blood of oil, it is not to be seen.
Earlier, leading to a shortage of containers garnel Testament, Esther Badom Bodo-Jetty on the side of the river.
In the meantime, become a slowly resulting water completely dead.
Five years ago, spilled into the huge vlahé area from broken the leadership of large quantities of oil.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must row at least six hours to get to the water, where the fish are: The Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger Delta is one of the most contaminated areas in the world.
The route of the River mangrovníkovými bažinami with a lot of the alleys tributaries is only detectable the whole gamut of spouště.
The engine of the boat brewed instead of light water hnědou mess and who sinks his hand into the water, pulling out a lamp fingers.
Roots mangrovníků tower from countries such as the black tyčky lékořice, rarely occurring palm leaves are letting their medal to hang.
We are looking for a flock of birds in vain, which is normally in the humid areas are: Once utichne engine on the lifeboat, rozhostí in earlier havens where it stinks like the pump, spooky silence.
"What is happening here is the environmental leadership of the war," he says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health. '
Compared with the war is justified.
The settlements Ogoni is a battlefield where they have been fighting for decades: More than 60 years ago, has been feeding dobyvatelé from Europe, the first here in the 1980's first crush the market-maker with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, Karmann Shell had to halt its production in 1993, because it was dangerous for the employees of the power.
It is still in the Ogoni firm must return: While the daily benefit of the entire area, about triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of the leadership of the more than two million barrels of the black gold, lies the oil fields in the area of the Ogoni idle for concern is that the power of the unstable situation.
Every few hundred metres from the water tower steel design as bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so it is up to the power of the head of the drilling otvorů něžně call.
They are 50 years old, the majority until his zrezivělá.
Every moment, joining such vrtného otvoru Akpobari, the head of the plane, and then pour constant flow of oil into the water.
According to estimates by experts, vyteklo the ecosystem in the more than two billion litres for 50 years: Every year in the amount of oil, what vyteklo into the sea in Alaska when the Exxon Valdez accident supertankeru '' 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There have been disputes, who is responsible for the remains of the environmental disaster.
While concern Shell called sabotage and organized theft of oil for more than 90 percent of the pollution of the environment, "Are you talking about bursting the minds of drilling and netěsných boards as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires a much smaller safety regulations in the world than is customary, accused concern in 2008 US-americký scientist Richard Steiner: Only the amount of disorder on the boards is supposedly 'times higher than elsewhere. "
On the ground, which from a distance looks like a plea, oil zašpiněná open-air workshop will emerge from mangrovníků characters: They are completely naked and after a slice of the oil.
Under one of the many casks, which are partly linked to the leadership, partly at random scattered after the country is on fire, fire: Illegal small refineries.
A barrel of oil in the fire in the meantime, a few hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
The Gulf ahead of leadership obliged to pot, petrol, kerosene kape later at the end of the leadership, and diesel.
In this way, produces Michael and his four associates on a daily basis to four sudy after 300 litrech: 'Profit so 34.000 Naira' - around 22 billion.
The people of the delta are chronic shortages of fuel oil in the largest state of black Africa.
Nigeria own only one refinery.
Ridiculously low cost 40 euro cents per litre for diesel illegal producers can still trump: Because they are the raw material for free.
From 'bunkerů' who link to the leadership in the area of the Ogoni everywhere: According to the experts in the area of the Niger Delta is losing the country on a daily basis, at least 16 million gallons of oil.
But only a small portion of the slightly provisionally skladované raw materials are illegally zušlechtí: The largest share of the suppression of organised criminal network, to whom they belong, as well as politicians and senior officials in the army, tankers and sell it on the world market.
In the debate, whether the people who caused the disaster and their intervention or lax way of producing, considers activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"If they find oil companies for Alien and if so perfectly whatever the nature of the fishermen then would not even sabotage or theft and illegal refineries'.
In the meantime, but it is, above all, the relationship between the Ogoni to Shell so damaged that strikes into account only the departure of the group: 'Perhaps to show other nations, such as the Chinese as better'.
Michael unsettles.
"High time to have disappeared, 'says svalnatý producers.
"Every moment can come to the soldiers."
If it is found the special military unit, and while they are in prison, but the painful bribe.
Also soldiers, who mostly comes from the north of the country - like all Nigeriánci - they want to profit from the raw materials.
'Tadle prokletá thing that has our country in all respects to the bottom, "says Akpobari.

29 miners in age from 17 to 62 years has been the canary in the hagiography.
In the restaurant, where the accident occurred, the probe was triggered by scams, but no trace of life.

The suits horor to artistic kinu?
Režisér Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old boundaries with their combat eposem 'Walhalla Rising. "
At what the audience thought about the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when točil 'Walhalla Rising'?
Captive vikingský fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from their torturers and on a large scale kills almost supernatural force with their opponents - it sounds ideally for young male viewers, who are seeking the bloody action, because it helps our hero cruel methods and killing their enemies rve even vnitřnosti from the abdomen alive when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Jednooký, as is, in fact, during the entire film called says not a word, and the other characters affirmations most one or two sentences or be swayed to painful cries of dying.
Otherwise silent and hýří in hrůzně beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers a past world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more an ideal for adults cinema aficionados interested existencializmus and very quiet images of a camera.
It is good when the film more target groups, it is just a pity when are mutually exclusive.
Režisér Winding Refn, after natočil their wild and stylizovanou trilogii on drug dealerech 'Pusher', is regarded as the Danish version of the filmmaker Quentina Tarantina stoicky, but preventing their content more mainstream of either humor or less semi-Asiatic artistic audience.
The majority of the supporters of the artistic cinema seems to be everywhere and vnitřnostmi discourage stříkajícím brain.
Fans of action films with unudí later when Jednooký issue from wild vysvětlitelných reasons violent group of Christian missionaries ships in Jerusalem and still leaves an eternity in bezvětří and fog than probably dopluje team in America and keep quiet.
What, then, is it any wonder that in Germany 'Walhalla Rising' get into cinemas, and has now been issued only on DVD.
This is a pity, mainly because of the splendid záběrům, but also because of the distinctive facade, points to a ruined blood, hiding exciting cinema, which receive little attention.
In this movie is not about the dialogues or precise, everything is atmosphere, subsides dream, which became the movie.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn moment to rest him or release him and slowly strangling their horror pictures and gloomy hypnotickým soundtrackem nepopsatelnou, but above all, the hatred that encounters from the hearts of the figures.
Only small blonďatý boy, which helps Jednookému, leaving something as innocence, all the rest are prosecuted anger.
Of all the most jednooký hero, whose motives are never explain, which will become a time for enemies and allies válečníkem transition from hell, perhaps envoy of the Devil.
Acts of destruction, but perhaps only for those rotten.
'Walhalla Rising' is a shadowy the film that it is possible to hate and admire, angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
The mysterious natural work.
The office of nuclear energy, the IAEA has new warnings on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, prevents the comments - and they control.
Around midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four similar Israeli F-15 fighter jets While čtvercovou terminal building in Syria.
Standing on the shore Euphratu; the nearest city is more distant 30 miles and called Dair as-Saur.
Documents in the office of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it keeps its name when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has reportedly with the aid of North Korea, in this čtverci schovaném in the valley, which odbočuje from the mainstream.
On the basis of the communication US-americké foreign intelligence service the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the village near el-Kibar well, threw for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950s on nothing else, it is not appropriate.
The CIA presented nezaostřenými video with satellite images.
Using computer animation to clarify where components before the destruction of the reactor could be, has to be a copy of the North Korean model zmenšenou Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, they were still the photographs that showed the building closely or even from the inside.
The reactor was supposedly shortly before launching, but even without the fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, knows much more than back then, and even more time to the puzzle.
Earlier US-prezident George W. Bush recently in his memoirs published that the CIA was before the attack, a lot of sure that Syria is building in el-Kibar reactor, but not the details of what is, in essence, that the country is' an active nuclear weapons program. "
Some of the secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about the alleged reactor "', even if the presentation of the CIA as the' authenticity. '
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
At issue, as it is certain that the reactor, said in the summer, a senior diplomat said the IAEA EIDHR 'enough material to stay' questions.
Suť allegedly 'unused military building "was quickly Syřany while odklizená and also properly zarovnali terrain.
Yet managed to find in June 2008 the team under the leadership of the former IAEA chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received the Member State via satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the time just after the attack, which should be more apt than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are on the market because it had bought the unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program, and has even put the reactor.
Uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, to Damascus.
But that has been disproved by the IAEA from the analysis of the particles.
Since Damascus is refusing to discuss the matter, as well as satellite immediacy.
In addition, a second inspection Transnistrian revizorům in el-Kibar rozbombardované and access to each of the buildings.
But Israel also utterly silent.
"We never comment on ', confirmed recently official position at the time of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been dragging on so miserably since June 2008 and 'growing into a serious problem, given the credibility of the office, "admitted Western diplomat as high in the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - it is, after all, a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons, which oversees the IAEA.
The IAEA is considered key to move forward on the other three plants, which are to be 'in connection with the alleged reactor term' - and unlike yet exist.
So far, neither the controllers did not cite which facilities are, nor what post or why they are suspicious.
According to the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung the IAEA is internally as Marj as-Sultan, the Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derives close again according to the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found the satellite pictures complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Probably be found within or in the immediate proximity of military bases - this is exactly why it refuses to Syria, the IAEA access to these three jobs.
In Vienna, said that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that would be sent to the US to advance the IAEA vypátral military bases.
Jaderní detektivové were alerted to the facilities of the US secret service.
The IAEA has a copy and also satellite images that between these three places and čtvercem for Euphratu transportoval material here and there.
A Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one furnished should be 'in connection with the production of fuel'.
But there are no 'no evidence of senzibilních activities, "that is, about the enrichment of uranium and new processing; the processes that are vital for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by the uranium, which is enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where it later be split the plutonium for the bomb to these central questions there are only likely estimates.
Also, it is not known whether the wreckage which could hide important clues, are shelved in these three places.
It disappeared from the face of the earth hundreds of the cost of freight wagons, nobody seem to have the information, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometres from el-Kibar distant, on the other hand, Euphratu slum-valued salt mine al-Tibni, which left Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable storage of radioactive waste, considers the IAEA as unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley gave him in connection with a reactor in one analysis of satellite images of the London-based Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that, after the IAEA demanded access, carried out by Syria on all suspects places natural work and removed large containers.
It could be a coincidence, but it helped to clear up the suspicions.
In addition, talk of diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months building plan for revizory, which would allow Syria to maintain the military secrets - only the exercise shows how great it is in the interest of secondary-school.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected the proposal.
If even a year ago uklidňovali Western diplomats in Vienna that it is, after all, the reactor destroyed, and that is why this thing nehoří, speaks for a few months, US Ambassador Glyn Davies on the so-called special inspections, which is one of the fiercest of Vienna, which has the authority to enforce the nuclear inspections.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, which would suggest that the inspections have already talked about 'options, which tend to be in the future, "in the meantime, however, is hesitant.
This choice offers great risk: On the one hand, it is a needed majority in guvernérské IAEA board and many of the 35 countries, certainly has no interest in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens when you finally find anything? '
Love in a time of war.
Since Angelina Jolie started in the summer to work on the still anonymous oncosts prvotině, encountered difficulties.
She wrote the script, this is a love story of women and men from Bosnia from Serbia.
Many more have not yet know - but even that is causing unrest.
Consistently talks about the woman, who is Muslim, falls during the war in Yugoslavia in the Serbian man who raped her.
Female managers Croat- immediately protested, so hastily moved the planned recording from Sarajevo in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film was in Hungary and is in postprodukci dotočil in Bosensku, but still objects.
Bakira Hasecic of the female victims of war, wrote via UN-organizace to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, now informed Croat- newspapers - Jolie is also velvyslankyní UN-organizace to help the refugees.
It is not just diplomatic - offered to women already weeks before the meeting in Hungary, but refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In kempech where znásilňovalo stories, students held the position for the victims and Jolie revealing enough about the scenario.
Her organization will therefore recommend UN-organizaci to help refugees to release as Jolie Reinišová, informs the Guardian.
Exactly what the scene wrote Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture had to read the script, eased after the smaller tug-of-war in Sarajevo - recording is not entirely clear why then Jolie yet arrived.
The author points out that in his film is no political intentions, with a great deal of effort into the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, that it wants to show the terrible consequences of the war, and all the parties involved to make room.
Given the content remains vague.
On the Internet, there is one version of the film, which is really quite different: Boyfriends are already knew before the start of the war, and once again, both when she is as Bosnia's Muslim zavlečená in Serbian kempu, where he serves as a guardian.
Which really is quite different than the 'rape victim falls into his tough'.
The fact that Jolie film really begins before the war, it is true.
Jolie correctly, that is to pressure 'which is not fair and is based on erroneous information. "
Now it can escape is already hekeři Hollywood: By illegally published on the Internet, its scenario, as it has already done many times.
Nothing more than gone.

About what it is like to build something somewhere else, he knows that for a half year, Seán O Donovan.
Because 29-letý engineer had no job in Ireland, is now employed, along with the 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.

The fear is that it could, with a loan to catch a good thing?
The moment, Donovan thinks doleje hot tea and says: 'I do not have children, I had to make a living out of it, and I am a young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again'.
Construction engineer does not like lamentations, which is now so often hears.

Common practice of democracy.
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as the support of private enterprise.
Crime is of greater concern than the unemployment rate.
Brazil and many of the regions is considered more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of a survey of Latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and had appeared in The Economist.
Because the poll has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first of these is that Latin America is quite a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in a number of countries on the periphery of the Pacific in South America, has risen sharply (see chart 1).
In Peru, for example, where since 2002, the average economic growth of 6% per year, support for democracy has risen from below 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Rose also in Mexico, where its economy after a deep decline in output in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are Democrats, the conviction which is withdrawing the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the areas were happy with how their democracy works in practice, it is about the same number as last year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it was about 25%, is a big increase (chart 3).
Approximately 34% said that they trusted the worst in their country and 45% trust the government, and, once again, it is about the same number as last year, but it is a big difference in comparison to the year 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, has undermined democracy in Latin America by the economic crisis.
Support came during the global financial crisis is likely to be due to the fact that many Latin American countries have suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net to help protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this week announced that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased only slightly in 2009, and this year, once it has fallen to 32%).
But the mood is changing, in a broad spectrum from country to country (see chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely acclaimed sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been serious, and the situation has deteriorated with violent crime.
Only the second time since the surveys began to see more of the respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives have become victims of crime in the last year, but that is a drop compared with a figure of 38% last year, and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Robust economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: Around 71% of respondents across the area says that private enterprise is necessary for development, this percentage has risen from 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable the development of their countries, this percentage has risen from 47% from last year.
Interesting is that 62% of respondents in Venezuela has the same opinion (and 80% of where supports private enterprise), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, expropriating many private firms.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared with 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, as compared with last year, unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the past year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country, predominantly in Mexico and in large parts of Central America, and Venezuela enjoys success in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Nicaragua.
The elections.
No one expected that the general election will be in Haiti, on 28 November perfect.
But they were far worse than Also-Rans, who are trying to help the country to be afraid of.
The elections marked with the box and recurring vote, voting inter-Member rozmetané after channels, fix the polling and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delays.
Many Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of the earthquake in January, potulovalo around and trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them eventually surrendered.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several prospective předběžců gibbered that this is a sham and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, have spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a very good choice '.
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community care have said they do not believe that these irregularities, whether they were serious, though not necessarily cancel the process'.
In other words, the show goes on.
Electoral body, whose voices are obliged to René Prévalovi, unpopular outgoing President and his candidate Jude Célestinovi, is to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The crucial contest is planned for January.
Election all hope is not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly raper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, walked from its original challenges to the vote were declared invalid.
But a problem can arise if Mr Célestin, which has a small or negligible support among voters, will be labelled Election Commission for a decisive contest.
Řádící because of an epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people who after the earthquake are still living in tents, there were fears that the turnout will be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the dezorganizace they been prevented.
Roughly 250,000 identification documents, which are essential for the vote remained nerozdělené shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians help themselves.
After leaders in the centres
In the weeks when suddenly ovdověla, Cristina Fernández, Argentine president, has benefited from sympathy to the public, when its popularity has grown from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet the reversal of this success in the successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections could depend on whether the injured Mrs Fernándezová muster up my late husband and predecessor and political partner Néstora Kirchner.
And all of these features will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy, and then as his wife successfully became president, he was in the habit of budgeting that foreign tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional revenue as it pleases.
Mrs Fernándezové government lost its majority in Congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and has further destabilised in the death of Mr Kirchner in the attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement they acceded to Ms Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (on which occurred to facial and accusing the government of corruption), Congress has failed to approve a budget for 2011.
"I am not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to the next year, and the president will have more room to spend as it pleases.
The economy is overheating over-utilised: This year, it is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists talk about the issue, which is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than to control inflation.
Has refused to deal with the IMF, the burden on the private sector and cleanse the INDEC, statistical agency, which has started to monitor official inflation statistics.
Judith Fernándezová can now taste of this policy?
Called for negotiations between private business and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit the growth of wages in the next year to 18%.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation eroded growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs Judith Fernándezová that wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with holders of bonds, who earlier rejected a debt restructuring, which Argentina in 2001 it.
Now face Mrs Judith Fernándezová agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this was not in sight of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to the proposed new national spotřebitelsko-cenový index, which will begin to resemble cleaning INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs Judith Fernándezová will want to remain in politics after the end of the term, if the husband is not after its side.
If we want to remain, needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the Argentine's return from their summer holidays, which is held in March, will be a wave of sympathy to decline.
If it wants to win the next election, it will have to decide whether to waive silently many opinions that her husband in politics.
Half the encouragement for China.
Taiwanští voters are closer to the close links with the mainland.
What do you think about her big brother Taiwan despite the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible, voted on 27 November, the mayor and the city council in five urban constituencies, which can be viewed as a wider assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is the representative of a feeling that to land, and have a strong commitment in business relations, including an agreement on the part of the settlement, in the largest free trade relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) ended prize of three of the five offices of the mayor, has failed to win the majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, Howard Democratic Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence Taiwan, won almost 50% of the vote against 45% for the KMT.
If it was about the presidential elections, President Ma difficulties.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party, has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the party, the DPP, together with the KMT in urban councils.
The elections took place as the majority of Taiwan's elections, which include noisy electoral trucks and mass assembly with vlaječkami the scantily oděnými girls.
Even quasi-obligatory non-document was part of an assassination attempt.
Sean Lien Lien Chana, honest, the son of the chairman of the KMT was canvassing for candidates KMT, on the eve of the elections.
A young man in the crowd shot at Mr Lien purely across the face, injuring him and killed a spectator.
It has not been determined whether it should be canceled ozbrojenec intend to hurt Mr Liena or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP, said that shooting influenced the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only great for the winner of the campaign, China.
It was noticeable how to remain in the background, the question of the mainland.
Instead, the candidates zápolili about the plans for the construction of public housing and create jobs.
Taiwan are usually uses its de facto independence and hate the military threat from China.
The KMT has a tendency to avoid links to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrain from vzbuzování anti-čínských positions.
This is a response to reality, and the realisation that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
President Ma for his party confirmed that China's policy is for the majority of Taiwan's acceptable.
From the government in Beijing can be expected to continue in the commercial bribes, along with its strategy to Taiwan lured back into the fold.
China losing time to send negotiators to Taipeje to arrange a summit on the protection of investments and medical collaboration.
It would also like to see the political integration, but in turn.
It will be better to wait for the presidential election in 2012.
In any case, was the DPP party itself.
Two years ago, it was on the wrong level: Its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on charges of corruption.
President in 2000-08 Koran was clear and supporter of independence.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai has developed a new generation, which is modest and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai was shout as DPP candidate for President, such as Su Tseng-changem, who held the post under Mr Chenem.
Their party is currently doing everything possible to demonstrate that it can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai told Taiwan to the public that the party is "a credible alternative to Mr Ma 'hurried approach to China.
Mr Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be a better place if insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
Even ordered Mr Su, pragmatikovi to stand for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr Chena DPP will fight the choice among potential candidates.
The KMT is justified to search their own people.
The assessment of Mr Ma was bad, and despite a rapid rate of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go with him in the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT spokesman says that re-organized its government, as well as the local branches.
Heavily promoted by the proposals to support Taiwan for a rapprochement are limited.
At the same time, as the majority of the people of Taiwan's economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chianga, immigrant publicisty, 'point of no return has passed. "

Microbes with resistance to arsenic raise the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of the strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the scope of the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, and says that this is a sign that life has opportunities that are outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has the dual capacity."
"Growth can either thanks to the phosphorus or arsenic. '
"This is very strange, but this is not proof that it is a form of 'truly' mimozemského life," commented the fact that Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, it was considered essential to the life of the six key elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and síra.
However, the researchers found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California, they are able to continue to grow as the arsenic replace the phosphorus.
"You begin to wonder what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is important in the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognise the life and know how life can look like Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report published on the innovation that has been discussed neprozrazovala details of the discovery, which has raised widespread speculation on the internet, the report reveals the discovery mimozemského life.
This is not the case.
'Discovery shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that set of the elements that we consider the' standard ', may not be so absolutely necessary for life, "explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual, because it shows the replacement of one arm to the other element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure, 'add Cockell.
It was not a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon Astrobiologického of Technology at NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake, because it shows a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements thought, therefore, that controlling, which is exposed to the elements, it may be able to replace the one in the second.
'Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to the phosphorus.'
"The result is that the organisms can very difficult these elements separated."
"However, the arsenic is so different that, as well as phosphorus is not working, when it gets into the body, to begin work on the biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and increasing the concentration of arsenic, bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes to grow better in the phosphorus, but, given that they can survive with substitute arzenem, increasing the possibility that the form of life that use arsenic, which can occur naturally, and that either elsewhere on Earth, or on another planet or months, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a technical assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by a used, is not new, but they will never be found, for example, which this fact has.
Arsenic was more common in the old days at the Earth, she said, and the scientists speculate that it could use previous forms of life.
"This suggests that it could be other ways to create life, not only in the way he created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simona.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of health.

Last year, police training in Beijing, the guide to this training was hijacked and placed on the Internet. In the manual was, among other things, the description of how effectively zmlátit perpetrators no sign of blood.
This year, the trader podomní with melouny in Shanghai in brawls with five policemen and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One videogame full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese policeman, as attacks on the street retailers.
'Chengguan terrorized the government, "the China Daily, the national edition, lament last year, after further discussion about the tactics.
On paper, it "really thoroughly cleaning '.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district wares in October, interest on eight new female policistek, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real obligations or are only withdrawing.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
Okres demanded the female roles in age from 18 to 22 years old with a good figure and 'five facial features in the proper proporci.'
Adeptky should have to adjust higher than the average - higher than the 1.6 metres.
Výslužba at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials have said that the work is mentally too demanding for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one police officer at Rednet.com flatly, though a government Web site.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external quality, which then determine others, these include height, weight and facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and 'internal quality'.
Women are as květinové vázy, he said, and added, "In addition to that, they will also have other vázami responsibility. '
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the leadership of the county town, with the power of this description.
But I would suggest that the demands on the size, are common in China, as well as for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the demand for the halves facial features.
Which means that the issue of good image is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilated certainly CCTB.
'Cannot allow us to serve chromý or hrbatý man, "said Mr Zheng.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, which holds the Tiananmen Baoguang patrol in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces as jablíčka and gently tvarovaná lips.
We do not consider that the emphasis on her appearance could have sexistický character, she said.
'Do you think that, in this uniform vypadám sexy? "she asked with ironickým view.
Its lived with dolíčkama, Xu 21-letá Agong says' Our job is to represent the image of the city. "
They have no objections to their limited performance, said, because their career ambitions are more than just zahánět traders into alleys where they can carry out their work.
Every morning, a group of more than a decade against trhovcům who they are running on foot or riding and trying to sell them as soon as possible and knedlíčků misek tofu before they are thrown out.
'Mr Wangu, you leave.'
"We have already told you very much!" She said, when Ms Xu trhovec began to flee, and at the time he left his round with perhaps with nudlemi.
Police describe their duties as more repetitive than grinding.
"Every day, it is essentially the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in their vacations marketing.
'A great routine. "
One of the reasons is that women do not have the powers to cover as their male counterparts, so that they can seize goods retailers.
Can only threaten the fact that the report their male leaders.
The tendency is to protect them against sudden public expressions of hostility against formality apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of citizens in Kunmingu, the capital of Yunnan province, revolt after spread false rumours that policisti killed the seller.
More than 10 police officers or police officers were injured in the small hours of the night; 14 government vehicles was převráceno or zapáleno.
Xindu yet such violence has been leaked.
But calm can be guaranteed only barely.
Only two blocks from the square, where calm Baoguang this morning should watch to cover street corner gathered more than 50 people.
Police seized a motorbike which opravoval instead on the bird inside supermarkets, as required by the law.
The owner could weep as he wanted.
15 minutový distance from the police, in the guise of September, with the elbow against vehicles and scamper away with motocyklem and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator přičleněný to male group, stayed behind, his white badge to turn to skrylo his name.
As well as the women's cover, coordinators are men over 40 years, who have only a role.
Unlike them, are not educated in the maintenance and uhlazování image.
Sometimes verbally 'fighting'.
'Sometimes physically fighting, "said Mr Li in practical terms.
"Mostly it is the public, which starts with this. '
Prosecutors are accusing Senator Ensigna
Prosecutors Department of Justice, the American Senator John Ensigna of criminal charges on his affair with a former adviser to the campaign, and his efforts to ensure the lobby, announced on Wednesday, Senator lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a Republican, faced nevadský and who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for president in 2012. The affair came to the national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensigna Office said that it was a decision which followed almost annual investigation, "certainly pleased".
Senator could still face disciplinary action for ethics commissions to the Senate.
Mr Ensigna lawyers said that the Department of Justice "to inform us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the aim of the investigation and that it is not in the plan to bring additional charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who argued that there are serious evidence that Mr Ensign was a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
The talks, e-mails and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglasu Hamptonovi, one of his assistants to secure lucrative lobby, which should lead to silence Mr Hamptona and his wife, a relative Hunde senátorově with her.
Mrs Hamptonová once worked as a pokladník Ensigna in the campaign.
Mr. Ensign was in contact with a number of political supporters, to find work for Mr Hamptona and supported their views after Mr Hamptona recruited to lobbied for them, citing documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently asistentem Mr Ensigna was by law from lobbying their former employers or the Senate, on the year.
Ethics experts say that the unusual deal, Mr Ensigna and Mr Hamptona who were behind friends, appeared at odds with the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been published, "it became clear that this is a clear case of violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense of clients who are investigating the government.
While officials at the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensigna, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialising in ethics, said that the department is cautious with regard to the political actions, after a number of setbacks, including the decision of last year to suspend the proceedings against former Senator Stevensovi old allegations of misconduct in the middle of the state prosecutors' offices.
Federal prosecutors' clearly away weapons, "said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (the citizens for responsibility and Ethics in Washington, DC), the advocacy group, which filed a number of complaints against Mr Ensignovi.
"This shows that, in essence, that the high-level government officials, the laws do not apply," he added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Mr Ensigna, in an interview that he was told on Monday called for state representative of the Department of Justice, and then the next day, and I told him that the department neshledalo no charges against his client.
Defence team of Mr Ensigna cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that, as a senator, his office to repeat in Wednesday's statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that convey state representatives.
"It is not nice to be painted me details of my discussions with the Ministry of justice in addition to that, we think we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which provides ethical group accusations that the payment parents Ensigna Hamptonům in the amount of $96,000 in violation of federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money would not anything other than a gift.
One company, for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hamptonovi find lobbying work was firm NV Energy, the main nevadská the company, which has long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that, after Mr Hampton began in society to work as a lobbyist, Mr Ensigna staff - John Lopez - interact with Mr Hamptonem and told him that 'bušil "in the Ministry of the Interior on the subject of the discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended the lunch with Mr Hamptonem and other nevadským confidentiality, Allegiant Air and urged the transport minister, agreed to a meeting on behalf of airlines after najmou Mr Hamptona on lobbying work.
When the last year, for the first time, a report on the affair, Mr Ensign has apologized to his constituents and resigned from his post as the fourth Republican leaders in the Senate.
After months of stagnation Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that it planned to take part in a third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign the aim of the investigation is no longer a criminal offence, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes that ethical Commission will be quickly followed by the Department of Justice and the end of the investigation.
"Senator Ensign has pleased to continue their hard work in the name of the people of Nevada," she said then.
Call Cheshire is turning to Twitter community.
In the ranks of the courtroom, half a dozen in the press.
Minute by minute, sending reports about the horrendous testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that more than 140 000 reports on Twitter of rape and přivazováním saw children to postelím, who was living in the house.
On Thursday, was held for trial Steven J. Hayese, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, families and place official end to impose the death penalty, for which jury voted.
But lawyers for Mr Hayese already filed applications with the court of appeals and arguments that a court probably employed years.
One nejprovokativnějších is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter - created the reporters' cirkusovou 'atmosphere and this widespread, immediate the penetration of information with inflammatory then erected porotu in the details of the decision in terms of influencing public opinion.
This could force the judge to look at the question of whether, with the arrival of new technologies do not demand new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think that there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of fair trial for the individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr Hayese.
The process of Judge Jon C. Blue senior state court rejected claims relating to yield briefly last week, and with the fact that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that would show that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it is not likely to be the last word in this case.
For decades the courts recognise that coverage of these notorious cases may lead to questions about the fairness of the process.
In a regulation from 1966 the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr Sam Shepparda for the murder of his wife, when in his decision, he said that in the case of the Sheppard versus Maxwell, in the process, because of the media was a 'karnevalovou atmosphere'.
Some are convinced that this offence was the inspiration of the television show and the movie 'fugitive'.
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts, which examine Hayesův judgment about half a century later, they could be surprised by the argument that it may be necessary for the new rules, which will determine the way of communication of the courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a common cause for concern about the impact of new media" in the highly sought cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Faculty of Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in the passerby and wrote the report, which said that it was made at random.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be preoccupied with the idea that the restriction on the immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The case of Twitter is just one of the many lawyers outlined by Mr Hayese, who would be able to argue for years to make the judgment.
Advocates also argues, for example, that in the case of Mr Hayese can go about bias when Blue judge refused to allow him to test the potential reaction of the judges, in the selection of the jury to justify criminal photographs of horror.
Some of the judges said they were appalled by photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates argue that also refuse the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge improperly dismissed beautiful, which was critical of the decision and that it wrongly used more pressure on the verdict and směroval porotu to on the weekend.
Porotci were separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
In a point of order against the verdict vzneseném said last month that the case of the reports, and was dominated by the passerby discussed during the election campaign, the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly the flames of emotions in this case.
'Daily influx of media cameras and reporters in front of the court, "the lawyer wrote,' was something here in New Havenu has still not been to see, and it is perhaps also the national raritu. '
Their focus on the interaction of Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later report and from their point of view, should the judicial police to manage the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers asked the appeal courts with often used arguments that the social and technological change require adaptation of the courts.
Lawyers for Mr Hayese seek this right.
In their archives are referred to the decision of the Supreme Court from the 1966 ruling in the case of Dr Shepparda, because of the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," he wrote, "is the case of the Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Courtesy, can bridge the divide?
After a campaign which was remarkable for its urážlivostí and negativismem, this week in Washington, there are a small number of courtesy.
It is the first sign of genuine cooperation between the two political parties or only iluzivní moment before the rapid return to the party in the fight in the city?
Talks Tuesday with President Obama and parliamentary leaders produced no major discoveries about the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a respectful discussion of differences of views of the two sides, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of partisan wrangling.
Wednesday's public session the president's deficit commission was also a civilised, despite political differences between members remain.
It seems that it is clear that the close collaboration for a period of several months to build mutual respect, which transcends the ideological divide, which still divides members.
And it is quite hard to argue that, at the start of a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in a test period - sondují other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also úterní negotiations and its subsequent assessment of the participants carried out with minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a quick change to the conditions that are there in the last two years.
Whether it is on the issue of taxes, spending, health care, or rights, both of the two sides are miles away.
However, the November elections, at least by Washington quickly.
"It is not a question of whether the regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's Administrator, is now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"Those are inevitable after the election.
The elections administration and those emotions faithful then utichli.
This is a good thing. '
In several issues, especially those that are to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts would expire at the end of the year, and nobody sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of this, and permanently or temporarily.
As a likely compromise on unemployment benefits not only because the Republicans cannot look at how to support the tax cuts for the wealthy, while refusing to support the unemployed in unemployment.
Following negotiations Tuesday in the White House is already see greater optimism about the possible agreement on those issues, along with the opening of the ratification of the new treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, noted that the successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties, when 112. Congress convening in January.
Rather, it is likely that a period of friction, or even inevitable, he said.
'Then what do the things that must be done in the short term, psychology to return to one of the confrontations, "he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to lead courtesy is real cooperation.
"I am looking at all of the events between now and 2012 as the shadow boxing, where the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
Reasons largely related to compiling the new Republican majority in the White House, voters and Tea parties who helped draft it.
Republican leaders now faces a danger Over-dramatisation, they know that it must live up to its promises and must reduce costs to the government and to repeal the new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the initial responses to recommendations about the deficit, which include a reform of the tax code and raising some taxes, an increase in the retirement age and a reduction in spending.
Two chairmen, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and, in his opinion, put pressure on the issue of deficit to the programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
They need but 14 votes in 18-ti členné Commission to be able to present their plan as an official recommendation, and fought to get to this figure as possible.
The greatest opposition is between elected officials in part, who proposed that in the case of the financial issues we have, at least today, the small bases or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phase in the battle between the White House and the Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans call Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, when the party will be followed by a period of greater cooperation.
What caused the shift?
Public opinion.
There are a lot of evidence that, despite the partisanship in the last elections, the majority of Americans wants to continue to see the two sides to work together.
If I could go to heel, as was the case in 1995, then both sides are very closely monitor the response of the public.
Anyone would be a reduction of the votes, to change course and probably will seek a compromise.
That may be optimistic view on the matter.
Stranickost and guidelines are now greater than it was in the 1990s, and it turns out that the more ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans, and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides, see 2010 as a prelude to the most important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, which appeared this week, would prefer to many Americans.
It will be a state, but many of the efforts on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide.
The leaked document describes Moscow as a haven of corruption.
The management of the city, is in the hands of the 'rule', and that is part of the corruption and bribes for protecting coming way into Kremlinu, to give the US represented in Russia in February.
The police and the security service, the Federal Reserve, to a large extent, the protective wing, which help to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
Collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called 'vertikála office "- will take their money, when they start to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of John ambasadora Beyrleho, was on Wednesday published by WikiLeaks on their Web site.
The record is based on sources whose names were redigována.
The record was written in a time when it was still mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of the corruption.
He was fired in October President Dmitry Medvedevem, but since then we can monitor only minimal changes in clean.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who own a prominent construction company, for many years, constantly denying the allegations of corruption, and won several lawsuits for false charges for such accusations.
In September, said on Russian television station when he was asked on the testimony of corruption: 'This is crazy, this is špína is svinstvo.'
The Russians with absolute conviction, believes that if their company is corrupt, it will show that the vote.
But it is unusual to meet with such details vyřčenými in such a way, and not in the report, and it is also ambasádní egregious that doing so diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its links with the criminal elements have led some to question it's dysfunctional, 'and confirm that the government operates as a rule, more than the government," says the report.
"Criminal elements of the so-called 'krysha' (the term from the world of prison and the mafia, which literally means' roof 'or protection), which provides them with the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the state prosecutor's office, as well as elsewhere in government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
'Analysts identified and degree structure in Moscow crime-inducing the world.'
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
'The Federal Security Service, the Department of the Interior and the militias are on the second level.
"And, finally, the lowest level of the ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"This is not a system in which criminal groups filling empty seats in some areas since the city does not provide some of the services'.
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest firms and the police is focused on smaller businesses.
One source said that the owners' shops in Moscow recognize that it is better to get protection from the FSB, or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), because they have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law. "
"It is for this reason that the protection from the criminal gangs it is not so, of course. '
The record says that while the choice of money is a comprehensive, protecting itself may have difficulties; even those who pay, can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay enough, their business under various guises by the blind.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but acknowledged that it has made little progress.
Ambasádní the report speaks of the men taking bags, jackets, probably cash into the Kremlinu.
"In its fight against corruption with Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview, Georgy Satarov, head of the Indem Moscow research team.
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because in Russia for the political class, no. '
Without the politicians with no opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationally is corruption Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154. place in a recent survey of global corruption perceptions of the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are among the least after the most corrupt).
The report of the US embassy in Moscow has appeared only in the late evening hours of the Russian government certainly ARCELOR enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Moscow's shortcomings may be accused Luzhkov, it may be for the Kremlin to argue, as the solution to the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry Kingem told Putin that the documents published by WikiLeaks could be counterfeit and May to respond to the statement by the American diplomats call Medvedeva Batman and Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is about our mutual interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, nedomnívali we that it will be done with such arrogance, with such duress, understand and neeticky. '
Khmer Khmérů veterans are forced to come to terms with the past.
In the poorly lit concrete classroom with zašpiněnými and oloupanými walls recall Anlong Veng High School, the director of the school, the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"All of us love Ta Moka. '
"He was a good leader and look after our own people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as' butcher 'for their brutality during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, remains commander in this remote državě of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, where the north-west popular built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where there are still thousands of former soldiers of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered government is nabouraná long-standing loyalties also in Anlong Vengu.
In April, it was the victims in the forum of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission allowed to publicly confront with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the Government has provided books, which explains the children for the first time in the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and court Kambodžský together to make the first of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the judgment, the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng thuggish associations, Kaing Khek Iev, famous as the spirit to 35 years in prison.
With every kind of progress had been increasing unrest among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to bring about reconciliation and their attempts to engage in Cambodian society.
"Between former Khmer Rouge is resentment and fear, but are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them it was a wonderful life between the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become the symbol of evil."
This divides the 'family'.
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or recast.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled Kambodžskou on the border with Thailand.
They launched a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary by guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok kultivoval supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country has been conducted to the first democratic elections in 1993, a large group of fighters of the Khmer Rouge began to switch to the government, which culminated in a scarcely Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and senior Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who stayed, was captured in 1999, the government forces in nedalých Dangrek mountains.
Phnom Penhském died in prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons, most of them already nepečovali former fighters of the Khmer Rouge have already gone down into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically recalls a time of movement.
Although a few of the elite of the Khmer Rouge to maintain their local government's position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people should surrender only the minimum benefit," said shock Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation Commission, which is leading the public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology regime."
'They applaud any ideas about the pursuit of free trade. "
Sor Lim, 55, who came to lent Rouge as teens in 1974, he fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before the dust as a poor farmer in 1998.
'Life under the Khmer Rouge was good, "he said.
'All' the Mok sustenance.
"But now, life is tough, because we all need to ensure ourselves. '
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the start of a trial to investigate Nuon Chea, senior Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leading přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but not said whether it will continue in these four cases.
It was just a little to calm fears in Anlong Vengu.
Recent media speculation focused on im Chaema, 64, who was a leader of the alliance in the province of Banteay Meanchey during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, investigators said of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that oversees the construction of dams Trapeang Thma, the project, which is likely to have killed thousands and forced workers.
The recent parný evening, im Chaem returned from work in the field of wood into his house on the dirty track Anlong Veng outside.
As the sun began to sestupovat and there were shadows across the arid grass, im Chaem refused to talk about their past between the Khmer Rouge.
If it was rejected by the court, would go.
"In Cambodia is peace and it is stable," she said.
"If the whiff of another prosecution will be war '.
The prime minister, Hun Sen, who přeběhl from the Khmer Rouge in 1978 also repeatedly warned that it would lead to instability, if the Court will seek another suspect, although with the experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must vykopat deep hole and bury it in the past," he said.
But a confrontation with the past is just what they have done for the movement forward Cambodia, Youk Chhang said of the Documentation Centre.
'Reconciliation in khmerským circumstances means to cobble together pieces of graffiti, "he said.
"It is our duty to fix these pieces together, so that we may understand."
The center issued the first textbook on the Khmer Khmerech approved by the government, has 75 parties and the title of 'History' democratic Cambodia.
The specialties in Anlong Vengu in June as an addendum to the Ministry of Education, the history of the book, which contains less than four sides to Khmer Khmerech.
Like many people in Cambodia, as well as young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details about the Khmer Khmerech, despite the city's links with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the middle school in Anlong Veng, said that the new textbooks helps students understand the important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically, when they took home the book to the study.
'My family refuses to many parts of the books, and the courts, "he said.
'Are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the Court will prosecute ".
Such opposition is more complex and difficult process of reconciliation, shock Leang said.
But public forum, textbooks and court are beginning to have an impact, said further.
The Khmer Rouge are still strong.
Up in the mountains is zarostlá Dangrek Mountains road surfaces vysypaná odhozenými bottles and bags, which leads to obdélníku of black soot, part zrezivělou plechovou roof.
Body Pol Pot here have been burnt down on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, bookshop mobilů on the edge of the road, said that he did not know much about the man who was at that point, the grave.
"But it has a strong spirit, many of the local people here go and pray for him," she said.
Sothea Nuom birthday, and should be in the plan later to visit a place of rest, Pol Pot, where the union will mature bananas in the hope that it will bring good luck.
Belarus agrees that their stocks of weapons on the basis of uranium.
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world, has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday to give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of a nuclear weapon.
The agreement was made in a joint statement, issued after a security summit, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergeiem Martynov.
The American government has for years sought to persuade Belarus to surrendered highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the stumbling block came last spring.
But American officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months has been with Belarus carried a classified operations, in order to eliminate 187 pounds of uranium from weapons on the basis of research facilities.
This paves the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement has proven to be one of the most important results the 47th Obama's national summit on nuclear security in April, which was ruled Belarus.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republics on the follow-up summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want to place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012. '
"It shows that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for the global security group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement as "an important, very important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised, in Prague in April 2009, ensuring that all sensitive nuclear materials around the world in four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's summit on nuclear security, announced the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that his nation would never give up its enrichment.
"We have the highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what is, in fact, the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," he said then.
"It is our commodity... we are not going to produce dirty bombs and also we are not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, and that is all.
Belarus, however, a few months ago to join the United States, and we have an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first is a commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly ozářen, officials announced.
Naložen was on a special train, which traveled more than 300 miles in the Russian facilities for storage and destruction, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out of the air, the officials said.
The US government spent $13 million for the program, most of it on the delivery of the research institute less enriched uranium, which is not appropriate for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was very carefully and zkoordinováno conducted on the basis of trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, the Department of Energy official working for the Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, to seek the removal of its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained over the years, mainly due to the harsh repression post-Lukashenko human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a thaw.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that greater democracy and respect for human rights in Belarus remains the basis of improving mutual relations and it is essential for progress in the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government has spent years ago, pumps with the CIA.
The Spanish government pumps goes on CIA flights transporting trapped talibance and Al-Qaida members in Guantánamo via the Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegramu envoy to the United States in Madrid.

"
In June 2006, after the announcement of the Council of Europe, which has been blamed on a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, there has been a meeting between the US ambassador and Eduard Aguirre Fernándezovou de la Vegovou.
Deputy Prime Minister, said that the announcement of the Council of Europe 'vyňalo the Zapatero government from the Games' and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
DE la Vegová stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights secret services through its territory.
'Simply want to be informed, "not to be' caught unprepared," Aguirre told in one of the documents.
Also, the foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the American Ambassador, suggested that the Spanish government would "give this matter as soon as possible, but the contours of the fact that this matter was in the hands of judges, had limited opportunities to influence cabinet '.
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González Embassy told that, if its concerns, does not intend to ask the judge to block the initiative odtajnění received the National Centre of the secret services (CNI) and Department of Defense relating to flights.
"This information contains no inkriminovanou component of no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after a conversation with the attorney.
However, the US has expressed concern, rather, because of the 'apparent coordination between Spanish judge and German prosecutors' than odtajnění CNI because of information or the Department of Defense.
'This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments' regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch, the US ambassador, and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaby told the ambassadors that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they considered the appropriate ', has already ordered his associates' instructions to avoid rozohněným mineral-resource-driven with the intention of reducing tensions'.
The ambassador also expresses its concern about the political negotiations, the Partido Popular Party (PP; Czech People's Party - which in this matter.
"Despite its universal pro-American Community-orientated our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take any suggestion that the government tolerated Zapaterova or deliberately ignored the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and that even in the event that this revelation could have negative consequences for the government of the United States," it notes.

PP would gain 4 seats in the House, and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia, which has lost 9 of the seats.)
With results from 28 November, the PP party could be the main floor in municipalities in Léridě Taragona, and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in votes and the number of experienced parliamentarians during recent Self-Governing elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia, which already has the idea of a general election, whether there will be an increase in or not, its prospects are more than positive because the number of votes in the nationwide elections is usually one such freedoms over the elections.
In 2008 gained katalánští PP 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the elections of the autonomous in 2006, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday won the Permanent (Popular Party of Catalonia) 384.091 voice.
If this trend increases, which was supported by the transfer of the votes from the PSC and loyalty PP voters, analysts have calculated that party, that if the elections are held, the Permanent Secretary in the Lords, could get 12 MEPs from the current 8, the party Convergencia and Unió (CiU, Czech agreement and the EU - which would also gained 4 mandates (now has 10), and the PSC would have lost at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia is for the PP and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) of vital importance.
According to this analysis, the ERC FIDES party (the Left of the Republican Party of Catalonia Cavan) lost one - now has 3 - while ICV (The green for Catalonia Cavan) should remain a mandate, or would gain even one another.
However, according to the parliamentary calendar, the nearest dostaveníčko will be held in May 2011, on the occasion of the municipal elections, which could also have a decisive impact on the PP the end of dominance by the Socialists in four major provincial cities, as well as the changes in the Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euro for 2011.
Both nationalists and the PP coincide with the possibility that it could lose PSC Hall in Barcelona, Taragona, Léridě and Geroně, where the Socialists received a majority, and neither would have not been able to turn to his traditional ally, the ERC and ICV.
Due to the debacle of Republicans would be impossible if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona Representation - as it is to gain at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Léridě and Taragona.
Nationalists are convinced that could play a key role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where, along with the governing party of the PP before the current mayor, Josepem Félixem Ballesterosem.
In Léridě PP won only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Ros Angel has very good relations with Mariano Rajoyem - during the last campaign, on several occasions.
A PP also on other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently the PP representation at 34 municipalities in Catalonia, I would like to create a candidate in what is perhaps the most communities.

This floating cell was not the only active, which should jihad network in Europe, and therefore the investigation in addition to the Thai services also participated in other European police forces, and therefore cannot be ruled out that in the coming days will not happen in other European countries to similar intervention, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when they were picked up by the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman Malik Asghar, Jabran, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand to develop further in which Pakistanis were captured Mohammed Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.

This means that the documents had to be men aged between 25 and 45 years old, had to have the force of a few years, be without vyznačených visas.
In investigative documents it is pointed out that they are not aware of any facts that would combine detainees from Catalonia with Massoud in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba ', should be one of the groups that the original passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before that Massoud was shipped from Catalonia anti-abusive agency about $1,000 that were 'dumped' to buy cards for mobile phones that later were used by members of the "commandos", which killed 106 people.

Catalan Joanmariae FIDES has arrived at a meeting with Arturem meat safely 18 parliamentary seats received in the election last Sunday, which is the figure is more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, thus candidate needs CiU that at least one of the formations that make up the opposition abstained in the vote on the appointment of his office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future of the alliance, which would like to keep the nationalists in the House, will take place for the general election, but so far the talks, which results in these days of the masses with the rest of the political leaders, are in Catalan spirit.
If it is embraced by the PP to win her support for the office, 'will have to do away with all sovereign and Liberation speeches', as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - which like CiU leader even to vote in the referendum.
The two leaders wanted to slim down a bloated political apparatus autonomous administration of the estate and darovací and reduce taxes.
Details of the negotiations for the office will be placing Masova deal within the PP Jordi Dolors Cornet and Montserrat.

In addition to the damage being done to the good name of the institution, which can suffer due to the fact that in the criminal activities of the carers, discovered a major threat to the home of La Caritat are now demands for material compensation already calculated legal representatives pozůstalých families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime has gone already in August 2009, and that since then stopped kill
The judge ordered the exhumaci eight bodies clients home for the elderly, with the suspicion that, in many cases, the deceased neprohlížel no doctor personally, but that - given the age and stress-related ill health patients - everything vyřizovalo over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday through its director, resolutely reject the extreme and emphasised that the "lack of action could in no way be the cause of a '.
A legal representative La Caritat add that "in case there are no indications that would be in addition to the defendant's own any third person guilty of misconduct.

The European Central Bank is
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to yesterday's threat Trichet, the President of the European Central Bank, which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react '.
Peripheral diferenciály close, and shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to Err, the euro has risen above the critical value.
This happened yesterday, is typical of the illiquid market which, although there is a downturn, has recovered thanks - but short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time, rather than lose their concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank to read that today, took back the level of liquidity, and tomorrow will be the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the closure of the plan to buy government debt for inefficiency, and the elimination of all the extraordinary levels of liquidity in the deadline and keep unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the level of liquidity 'forecasts at least until March' and keep the three-month licitaci with unlimited access to the end in order to provide liquidity trimester at least until June.
We also hope that it will continue its programme of buying bonds and that even announce its intensification.
Nenaplní-li created expectations will again by the response from the markets yesterday, and will continue to blindly continue withdrawing liquidity extent, God with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where he argued that even thinking about purchasing bonds, and there has been a collapse of the markets - tomorrow could history repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and steadfast.
In May it announced pancéřová fist on Monday, and on Wednesday said that they had already bought much, thereby setting off another meltdown of the market.
Yesterday's gates holdings to one year in Portugal was very poor.
EL Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5,28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus interest rates in Portugal fell about 30 points lower, odrážejíce so change of mood in the market, which occurred after Trichet said.
In Ireland was published figures represent a loss of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts are roughly 10,000 million in short-term securities and other potential 15.000, in February, have a chance to become private equity, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, then what is the problem in July, nor from tests, the amounts are in the aid plan acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to win the approval of the new Parliament and still does not have enough support, so in Ireland remain a uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of his speech to release tension in the face for the next meeting of EU leaders to be held on 14 December, at which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would have shown that the Union and we are all in the same boat.

In Spain, Prime Minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan of action, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous areas and financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment - to the ears of investors that sounds like a Four seasons from Vivaldiho.
Double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, which is double than other European exchanges.
Unlike February was the reaction of the government and the national banks fast and convincing - apparently benefiting from the effect of a surprise.
Today we have a key licitaci bond for three years, which will be the beneficiary effect Trichet, which we hope will be a big demand for it, which will help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinance.
Ask for a rescue plan would be for Spain self-sacrifice.
Give us the cash that we do not need - in El Tesoro is available 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March, as well as high rates and access to markets, we should be able to conclude a sine die.
However, it is important to continue to use the strategy Cesarovy women - 'not prosper, but also by zdáti'.
We can do it.

Mixing Red triumphs in formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since mixing Red vpadnul series to Formula 1 in 2004, his history in the state of the world, the speed is characterised by surprise and success.
Initially no one took very seriously the possibility of a new "team, and, despite an upward trend in recent times, we are all alike in the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonsa.
Without the ability to reduce equestrian-sports champion, Germans Sebastiana Vettela, or the possibility of Renault, which is powered by the engine of his car, in the world of Formula 1 legend was born 'secret weapon', which multinational Siemens piled into the hands of mixing Bullu that it did so, the winning team.
This is, in fact, the CEO of software simulující marches, which the German firm said on the market in 2007, for the purposes of very distant motor sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software the device is used to draw up the assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in terms of energy industries and for appliances with a high degree of accuracy.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce product or simulate process before it created, and thus can avoid unnecessary errors and spending.
PLM facilitate development fotoaparátu Canon, aircraft Su-30k or iconic commercial vehicles Nissan brand.
Motor Russwurm, the leading industrial Taurinense Siemens, explains that the use of this software machines allow mixing Red 'team place within a few hours, in almost real time' modifications and improvements, which otherwise detekují during the race and tests.
Russwurm says that, in 1992, on average, 10 fold employed engineers, who were able to make a maximum of three or four better during one period.
In mixing Red team working today to 180 young highly skilled professionals Rezé information technology executive who analyzed and suggest each type of danger of GM vehicles.
Leaders of Siemens PLM explained that the software is able to analyse and improve all the elements of danger of mixing Red vehicles, with the exception of an engine, for fully accountable to Renault.
Consolidating the materials, fuel, aerodynamika and security features.
Change is possible to transfer from the virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to the advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autokláv.
The only limit of this technical achievements is the amount of $40 million, which is the maximum that anyone can take the Formula 1 team for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Mixing Red established around 50 km from the London race to the top of the technology for the design and production of their danger of vehicles.
It is about the two buildings, which are restricted the entry of Hollywood - especially journalists.
What is happening here, is considered "a mystery".
The list of the project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettela and Marek Webbera.
Mixing Bullu hero is in formula 1 without doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
For the unfathomable technological means that label energy drinks stepped into his participation in danger of categories, of course, there are other actors whose help is invaluable, and while no one knows.
The head of manufacturing technology Steve Nevey says that five years ago, it was impossible to say that the advances in research and development of vehicles contribute to victory from 50%, and the rest was thanks to Horsemen.
At the moment, this ratio changed and the technology behind the achievements of 85%, while pilots contribution from 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, because they are 'nepředvídatelní gladiátoři'.
HP up during the two years of the 20 own shops in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in cooperation with its trading partner Pont Reyes vowed yesterday opened its first exclusive ticket in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 shops on land 80 to 100 square metres that the multinational company in Spain is planned to open in the next two years.
These shops will be placed in 16 existing trading houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El CORTE Inglés.
Viceprezidentka Spanish HP Helena Herrerová said, as an example of the newly přestavěnou ticket to Barcelona gran Vía Pont Reyes, belonging to the company, which is working with HP already 30 years.
The North American company přichystala plan for the establishment of 200 sales jobs in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), trade in Barcelona is the third.
Herrerová did not reveal where the other shops will be open, however, admitted that Madrid could be one of the few jobs.
Herrerová, which also leads personnel systems, HP sure that philosophy opening shops will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
American firm advises here with an exclusive styling equipment shops (with products that it is possible to test interaktivně), which will be in Europe is identical.
In addition, HP also covers ensuring staff for business.
Helena Herrerová denied that it was a franchising, and emphasised that the exclusive network of outlets and aims to improve the service, "zákaznický services to small and medium-sized businesses in the purchase, the operator, after-sales service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of a pilot programme pionýrského at world level, which aims to tackle any problems with the computer equipment in the guarantee.
The online service is connected with technical centre located in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"So we will be able to resolve the issues during the 10 minutes that might otherwise take up to two days.
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large firms already have contractual service, technical assistance," stressed yesterday Helena Herrerová.
Sabadell betting on the fact that the 'stolen' during the three years of its competitors million clients.
More optimistic than other bosses delegovaný bank Banco Sabadell councillor, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be difficult for the Bank, but refuses to a new liquidity crisis and predicts passive end of the war.
Yet it is the reduction of interest rates, but they will try to compensate for slevněním bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell, it is expected that he will be able to during the three years to get a million private clients.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and will not be able to survive in the tough economic conditions.
In 2011 the bank will trigger a new strategic plan in 2007 to three years.
The aim is that in addition to survive without recourse to the public aid in FROB gain market share podchycením million new private clients - or 700.000, odečtou-li those who leave or bank - because until now ai Cantacuzino rather hýčkal small and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises than retail clients.
This year has already had 250,000 private bank clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its share of the market is, when it comes to private clients 3.5%, while for corporate zákazníku this is more than 10%.
Another feature of the fundamental ideas of the plan is a commitment to productivity, or we can also say that, in order to reduce the costs of sobriety, whose challenge to the Bank, when it will present the results of the period.
Few banking institutions in this time, dares to set targets and to publish them because of the financial crisis has changed all of the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell shut down its programme this year, Optima set four years ago, even though it was originally for three years, but the situation on the markets require extending for another term.
Clients who leave from L, their main target group.
At a meeting convened by APIE Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be "difficult and very important '.
Indeed, I think that the way out of the crisis in Spain will be "protracted".
In addition, it will be in two or three years' very difficult to create employment ", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although believes that passive war - which reduces margins - away, the price of premiums for the risk that banks and savings to pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity has already shifted to the price of credit, thereby compensated by a reduction in the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will be pressure on the loans' factor.
"We turn off, but diferenciály are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increased prices diferenciálů - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
Also recognised that trends in banking 'now is to reduce commissions', but there is the framework of the 'competitive'.
The strategic plan for banks Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for nothing did he assures that, in Spain "will demand greater size".
"Next year will be left on stone unturned," he assured.
Confirms that the needs of the capital are "much reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions comes between red numbers.
And she points out that, FROB can replace the collection of funds in the market before the new measure of capital.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, remains a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a liquidity crisis.
It notes that there is no issue, but, in contrast to what it was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through the repo rates, which lessens the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers &
CEO CECA refused yesterday that should be another wave of mergers & and once again insisted that the speed with which it is being carried out by the reorganisation of the sector.
When the association started the process of the Spanish savings, a few of the institutions that assured that this first phase of the ceremonies, and the wait for a second round.
However, the Director General of the Confederation (CECA Loan), José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled that should rise to a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that the majority of the merger has already been carried out, inkorporaci Cajasolu into the Banca Cívica cannot be considered second round, what is happening is the convention."
"The majority of the business is carried out, it is possible that, instead of 17 institutions will go to 13 or 14, but all the great processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well in this matter," said the director.
In their statements, at a meeting of the Association of the ADEA (and executive officers Aragonu Cavan Olavarrieta revealed that the concentration of the process is "the highest possible speed and we have to be very pleased, as exhibits in installments, which at the time, not now emerged in commercial plans will face the National Bank of Poland," he pointed out.
'Move from 45 L, with an average amount of assets 28.000 million to 17 million is a process of 75.500, which is unprecedented in the history of comparison, redukujíce so the number of institutions on 62%, so that these were larger, and thus, in accordance with the Treaty of Basel II, "underline that point.
Olavarrieta recognised that "there are a number of very fortunate views on the slowness of the process," which shows a lack of seriousness and 'understanding', because 'what does the Spanish National Bank is a memorial to the fact that we need to be before the end of the year in the term'.
CEO CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday that Spain has the highest financial system throughout Europe and 'probably' and in the world, and those who question awarded 'lack of knowledge. "
The director said that in the current favourable economic situation "can be assured" on the financial institutions and Loan and a system that has sufficient resources' very important 'process' concentration and which is the highest possible speed. "
I also recall that the Spanish banking became very well from stress-causing tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and German red line.
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on markets provoked double the government's response.
On the one hand, he suggested José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses, despite the regulation of private zprostředkovacích agencies or the abolition of 426 the euro without benefits for the unemployed, up to 49% of the privatisation (AENA Spanish airports and air traffic management - Cavan) and El Prat airport manager made and 30% of the national lottery.
Elena ViceChair Salgadová, with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the critiques about Chancellor Angela Merkel, due to its responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret these feelings?
A witness said that Merkel is not the fault of the position in its communications policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefinice the euro.
And Germany has radically new vision of what it is to be his future, which runs on the idea of respect for the old traditions, which is a big part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance in Germany begins to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of these is the strong euro, which would be part of it, but also, for example, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, while the Southern States should leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although now it may seem like scifi, this version has broad public support, the approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals recast the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, fiscal stringency, fines for offending States, possible delay payments for some of them, and with the extension of the possible cost of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time, so for now defines evasion is not space.
First of all, when in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission had encouraged deficits, pulled out of the basement, the German government's constitutional reform, in order to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of conflict between what was Germany for the right (plans for fiscal stringency and the stability of public finances), and thus what within its European partners, including France.
The second showed the Central European country, when Merkel painfully spinning the decision on the rescue of Greece.
Back then, it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and in public opinion, which was also published, have been strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October Merkel once again with a clear position, when called for the reform of the European Union to allow the bailout of any member state, and at the same time, to have a private creditors to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because the speed of the Irish crisis and everything else.
But her proposal, although in somewhat zmírněné form was agreed and, over the next few months should monitor the reform process of the Union, which would from 2013 enable these measures.
Germany took the red line, which is going to go.
And everyone tells us that, although we now need to do, which is probably not, since that date will be the end of the old functioning of the euro.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone, in which nations will breach of the rules and can be severely penalised forced to announce a postponement of payments, and the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to give a firm path of growth, the increase in the rate of savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another possibility was based on, and the building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which governed in the years of the boom in the growth of Spain, simply not going to be tolerated.
Supply is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we understood that.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we want is a much tougher.
And the worst thing is that under these circumstances, we might ourselves zmýlíme.
I hope that these current turbulence replace the greater calm.
And that will give us the opportunity to spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood and his dual statements (reforms promised after meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of the new measures), it suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel opened up the idea that there is a need to put things in order.
But the red line, which Germany itself, there is, and that it wanted to move.
And of the possibilities which can be considered to be leaving the euro area full of very serious countries ruled out.
Now, Germany will always be able to say that we have been warned.
Sport and circumvent the rules.
Finty what showed Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajaxem, show ingenuity not intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly contrived exclusion of two players real Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against supporters of 23 November has caused that it was written about whether Sea brushes this is or is not nesportovní behavior, and whether players should perhaps both footballers to punish.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly vyhraný) appointed players after the second one intentionally losing time at a moment when Fowler should play so sudího was instigated by, and that they have shown a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the appropriate sentence in the next match against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in their group in the forefront - and deprived of the cards will be able to continue to the next phase.
By the end of the disciplinary commission UEFA trenéru José Mourinhovi punishment to two games and provinilí players got the money to pay a fine.
Provoking yellow card for similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less normal in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, the rules that are customary, but watching.
Part of the debate in this case arose due to the fact that it was part of the Real Madrid team (which is in its anthem boasts magnanimity and honors, and which has a similar actions of their players fined) and, it seems, also thanks to dramatizaci led Mourinhem, which so adds to its long history of buffoon and provokatéra another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of negotiations, which is not the rules explicitly banned, is in conflict with the principles of the sport, is whether these words in there to circumvent the law; it is, in fact, the actions that respect the rules of the sport, whose sense, however, it seems, is trying to wriggle out of.
With what type of damage such negotiations are sporting spirit.
One of the details of the sporting behaviour is physical integrity protihráčů, which was not in breach of these cases, there was a violent game.
Another of these details describing clean the game is to avoid the players through its offence against the rival team had the advantage - which also did not happen.
Ironically, the action of players real Madrid is the fact that this did not happen, what normally charakterizujeme as a trick or to circumvent the law, there is no such breach of the rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this should be seen as much as possible, in order to receive the penalty.
And like to wait for death.
Another question, however, is what advantage of guilty from his deliberate offence will have.
Here it is necessary to say that the lack of a rival handicaps, and in the actual match get any benefit, as the obvious implication is that the team will have fewer players.
And even this is not a useful strategy to another struggle, because the club will not be able to count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the future of the game.
But it is an advantage to take a long-term perspective and with some degree of unfortunate, then, at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and beyond that in this negotiations the odbudou players punishment, and switch to a second round, in which the card to the exclusion of just one card less than in the first round.
So how will the wheels continue, will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations go against the spirit of Sport, which is to make the strategic decisions that will enable us to obtain the maximum benefit under the rules.
In the event that we are dealing with here, not players for the goal of avoiding the death (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chosen when he faced.
Make strategic decisions without avoid punishment or before fleeing.
Although it is the line between wit and bypassing the rules clear, I believe that in this case, it was a savvy.
It seems to me that the controversy arises from two reasons: Because it was about two samovyloučení and because of the way it was with the instructions to transfer their provocation from the leadership.
Damage to the sporting principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
The offers on the holding of Christmas parties in Barcelona
Though the calendar year, a spate of reserves, concentrated on 16 and 17 December.
Quickly mount, all employees of the celebrations themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 of the euro.
As well as the Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of the December once again come pre-Christmas street, which still operates as a bombshell kyslíková for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but, thanks to the crisis, have resulted in the fight to win customers by reducing prices for food: Almost all want to spend 20 to 30 of the euro agree dotázaní entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To finish the numbers of complications, zkoncentroval calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) applications for a week since 13 December, giving rise to a flurry of bookings for days on top of the (16 and 17.), while in the previous week was almost no traffic.
As has happened since the start of 2008, when the lean years, many of the firms that collective street from the budgetary reasons to lift.
To abandon tradition, many employees, is counting on a cocktail of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demanding prices on the verge, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
Representative patronage restaurant facilities at this point does not dare to predict what will be celebrations this month.
"People think twice before becoming a booking than do. '
"They want to, but when it comes to the subject of food are careful," he adds.
Those deals will go well, "who would offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says, and suggests that, thanks to the crisis, consumers have tended to be a degree of mines and most zákazníku now wants to spend around 25 euros.
In various establishments, the survey shows that the greatest strain requests for tickets is on the evening of December 17.
The group espouses Soteras real boom reservations on Friday, with most of the requirements is to spend 30 euro, which adapt the menu, whose overall prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
In other major companies which is Andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (the Hostal de la Rita, magazine, La Fonda and other) brought a peculiarity of the calendar more early booking and have been since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible possible, in order to keep prices from last year, and our menu, from which it would have to choose each range from 19,95 to 30 euro," they say.
In An Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic QuQu, and a total of 23 companies remain optimistic, having seen since the second half of the year, an increase in profits and have relatively solid prospects for the Christmas sales.
Sources insisted that the company also 18 December it will be a day of relief, since the pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
Six clan menu added to its menu of Christmas, with a budget to 30 euros or more, as seen in comparison with the previous year, the guests tend to spend about 10% more in exchange for other items, such as the cava (Spanish šumivé wine - Cavan).
Note also that some firms that once again zvou their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Vicepresident society Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of bars, restaurants and leisure centres in Barcelona) Enric thousand-member believes that is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and says that the number of tigers' boring ', although clients' bargain at best. "
This impression even during Christmas celebrations, whether it be known, who are paying attention.
Pakistan's nuclear program has produced a great deal of unrest in the US.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons' at a faster rate than any other country ".
Wikileaks documents show links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the US State Department published portal Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary turmoil in Washington gives the Pakistani nuclear program.
Alongside objasňujících and important details that offer about the content of the communications and ideas of Representatives North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries, when it comes to nuclear security, instead of increasing, 'is on the wane, and that this unstable Asian country produces' more nuclear weapons than any other state. "
The specificity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are smontovány store, but after the components to be znesnadněna their destruction in the case of the attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington.
This eclectic ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Pattersonová in one report ahead of a visit by the then national security adviser, James Jones, said: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
An increase in the number of people connected with the nuclear arsenály and cruise missile programme is no longer observable only the US, but also in Russia, such as the widening and a reason to be wary.
"Pakistan had to protect nuclear facilities to recruit staff with strict religious faith; given the decline in the level of education and culture have extremist organisations more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programmes or programmes cruise missiles," said Yuri Korolev expert from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with their counterparts from the US.
The biggest new documents published by Juliana Assange is increasingly less cooperation between the US and Pakistan issues in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Ambasádou cables released in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as a "frustrating," saying: "There is often no transparency; offers of assistance remain unchallenged or are rejected.
In another report, notes Peter Lavoy, the national intelligence officer for South Asia that "despite the economic disaster produces Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as they have no other country in the world".
Ambassador Pettersonová also is asking Washington to during a visit by the head of the army General Ashfaqa Kayaniho, "very well," explained that "Pakistan's army must break with the quiet support of terrorist groups".
Hunt for the head of the Wikileaks
Obama nominates senior member of staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, to avoid the new tax information.
Interpol issued a red 'challenge' to track down and identify where Assange could be.
Everything on the Wikileaks and its founder, Juliana Assange are complicated maze, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday 'emergency call' so-called mixing notice, 'lokalizování and monitoring the movement of the' Assange.
But it is not a classic order for the detention.
In addition, this call is not new, but dating back to the 20th of November.
And it has nothing to do with the recent releases of more than a quarter of a million of the diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse, which faces Australian in Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of Wikileaks assures the inventor Mark Stephens' police knows where and how to contact with Mr Assangem '.
It was the 20th of November, when the international police force, based in the French Lyon issued the order at the request of the Swedish, kept him up until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
For this situation has 188 countries Interpol guidelines for identification or location "Assange to impose on him a temporary link and give him '.
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of people, which relates to the red challenge many of the Member States, as the organisation explained, however, consider the so-called mixing notice for allowing the arrest carried out - it must be ensured the national component of the police - especially in cases where countries are mutual agreement on extradition of detainees, as is the case in the case of Sweden and England, where it would probably be engine-house Assange.
This step pohoršil Assengeho attorneys, who yesterday published writing, which claim that the founder of the WikiLeaks devětatřicetiletý shown a willingness to answer questions the Swedish authorities through video conferencing.
Recall, too, that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from of his case, that comparisons with legendary Lavrentijem Pavlovičem Berijou, Stalin's head of security.
"This is the race and not legal persecution," the letter states.
While it is looking for the rest of the world - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is increasingly in an unknown place, but silent.
On Monday sent through Skype interview from unknown, editor-in-chief of the magazine Time - in this interview has resigned, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If that was responsible for the behest of the US diplomats to engage in espionage in breach of the UN and international conventions that have signed the United States, should resign," he said.
His view was yesterday rejected by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbsem kvalifikoval call that demise as' ridiculous and absurd ".
"I am not sure why you should care about the opinion of individuals, which runs a Web site," he said on CNN.
Obama himself has appointed senior member of staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse to stop another evasion documents.
The spokesman for President Barack Obama to stop adding Assangemu contrasts with the views on the importance of that in these days of the avowedly conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of Congress, who will chair the Committee since January to national security in the Commons chamber, the Foreign Ministry asked to look into the possibility of including Wikileaks between the terrorist organisation, "in order to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who would assist them financially or otherwise provide assistance".
Further went to Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should 'be killed, "which, in turn, had to withdraw it.
"Obama would call on him to pay to use the aircraft or drones or something '.
Who did was Mike Huckabee, a former priest, baptistický guvernátor Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the release of the information to the treachery and any other punishment than the execution would be too lenient," he said on Fox station.
Puigcercós looking calm in the ERC 'pomrkáváním' supporters Caroda
The Republican leader to the secret vote on its remaining.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and after schůzovního system.
Joan Puigcercós probably find a recipe, as combat already několikátou internal rebellion in the ranks of the Republican Party and the Left of Catalonia (ERC Cavan bezvýslednou), because of the loss of 11 members, and half of the votes.
The party is aware that his gesture seems to be about the demise of the former leader's supporters to Josep Lluís Caroda-Roviry inadequate, and also knows that the impact of this sector is now already weakened himself as its leader, and that he absolutely cannot do such concerns, what with other living currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will seek to gain new criticism by pomrkávání, which will help to shield the municipal elections.
First Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee, will be able to speak to his staying in office.
With ballot papers, not catch the eye.
If they want to give the supporters a voice Caroda President will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, it wants to avoid schism in the head and the subjugation of its people.
In several conversations, argued that it would not consider endorsed by half of the votes, and one, moreover, but add, without defining percent that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria."
Supporters Caroda demand after the President more than to give its function - which is seen as a gesture that has no weight since Puigcercós sjezdech controls on the body.
But, given that they do not have sufficient majority to be able to enforce 1999, will seek to executive Memorialized plan from now until May.
Due to expect that they will participate in the drafting of the document on the strategic reorientation, which will vote on the leadership of the National Council of the day in 18 months.
Their aim is to encourage Puigcercóse in exchange for the promise of Congress in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that 'mnohohlasnost' Mutilates stability, and that his aim is to once and for all, the organization has been able to launder their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be symptomatic of the article, which the current advisor to Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After having taken into account the Puigcercósův ideologue, this adviser for innovation was a fait accompli, that the leader will be confirmed, "in exchange for a few goals.
And those appointed five, two stand out.
The first is the 'překomponování' executive, so that was at least 90% of its members, which means also include the new faces who are from pro-business Carodovi sector.
The second target may be big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC completely end schůzovnictvím as a mechanism to function.
And so is fighting for reform of the constitution to be held by forming the delegates selected the vote.
Model schůzovního system, to end the opt-out in the Spanish system of political parties, it is intended to Puigcercósova team, which, in this direction has already fought on two recent sjezdech.
However, cramped Assembly in 2008 decided that schůzovnictví must be considered at a special congress of reform of the constitution.
This matter is still particularly as the situation inside the dissuaded from resolving this issue.
Now, without strivers critical sectors, would be a good time to address this issue and try to close it once and for all.

However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebrasky, has stated that he will vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiany, expressed his support for the law.
Supporters of the Dream Act because they need to get a few Republicans on the case that other Democrats have decided to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators, with whom most supporters, are negotiating from Maine Senator Olympia Snoweová and Susan Colinsová, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, which added mandate Senator Mela Martínez.
Other Republicans, who have in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utahu and Kay Bailey Hutchisonová from Texas, but they said that the next time there will no longer support him.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, in the moment, even myself.
Although the House of Representatives is sympathetic to the other version, according to most analysts Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Insert a finger into the wounds with literature (' poner el dedo en la llaga 'translated' to put a finger to the wounds "is the equivalent of the Czech 'strike hit the nail on the head - Cavan.)
The second round of the cycle of pleasure from the language was promenádou, where participants displayed a gala presentation of literary
'Sex in a language I understand, but... a finger into the wounds? What awaits me?, "asked the novelist Luisa Valenzuelová, which was invited to start the second round at the language of the cycle, which has been celebrating the literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as podtitulek another Exhibition (on the table have devoted to the subject of sex in a language to explain).
Finger into the 'brings us to close, "commented líbezně Argentine writer to the audience, made up mostly of young people who had gathered at the International Exhibition of literary in Guadalajara to vyslechlo this debate table moderovanou Marisol Schultzovou and with the participation of Valenzuelové, Sergio Ramírez, Mayry Monterové and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuelová to read the text, which devoted Gonzalu Celoriovi Schultzová, and then called for the excellent povídku in which was Luisa in the first person as protagonistka that in the search for knowledge, what is' blow 'go from doctor to doctor, from which she received the answer, although traces of the same story, yes.
Since leaving infektologa convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, this may be my morning '.
Eventually, after frustration with traumatologem, which has picked up steam in the middle of the road, but explain that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst, which will reveal the secrets of this morning: "This represents a truly rozevřené and the symbolic is' wound.
Protagonistka odlehčeně povzdychla, and concluded that 'the wound, she managed to learn much that is what is really rozevřeným and that there is no', but, due to the belief that the pleasure and pitfalls in language must go hand in hand.
The novelist Valenzuelová played with both.
Nikaragujec Silvestris Ramírez also spoke with rozkošným tale, which called the praise of invention, in which there is no finger in the coup appointed, but in one moment they emerge.
With elements of the magical realism focuses on the famous čarodějce, which played the clouds, brought back to the people who have moved away or napravovala počestnost, which has lost one panna, this story, which is then turned to speak America, a great novel in which, since the beginning of his own nechyběli kronikáři, who told him, and there is a quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, which is critical in any exaggeration narrative captains.
Cervantes', which all of us (writer) invented, mocking fingovaným testimony in the case, which has been presented as true, but in a different way, has never failed to tell the story of America with such obrazotvorností, which lacked even shame '.
However, stress, 'they are not fools and liars who are more creative', and that is where the parents and lie, where already knows what the story belongs to one of the group, and the other, the fictional literature at its peak.
This is called a 'cervantovskou tradition'.
"Thanks to his legacy, we are what we are."
Subsequently Mayra Monterová stressed and praised the diversity of interpretation that the invitation of the International Exhibition of the book, with its besedou finger to allow the wounds.
Kubánsko-portorická novelist has its finger on a major blow to the social violence, which is undergoing its countries - and shares to Latin America - and this is the result of trade disputes, and the sale of drugs.
"I think that a good literature, good poetry and good song struck quiet compromise, which, of course, it is intended," she said, after it said that the reality of the literature is communications and dimensions of a compromise, which creates between the author and the reader - and in their 'chemical reaction ".
The evening concluded the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also placed the emphasis on the 'finger into the writer zavázaného writer. "
He said that, in the world, who live in haste, also in intellectual habits and control of Gaza, which, on a forgotten dogmatismy, 'that for every yes is small and not for every denial is also small yes'.
'We were masters of our ideas and reality: Spin and spin means many times to put a finger to the wounds and bother those individuals who are much more convenient, because thinks karikaturách, in black-and-white in fixed ideas and without colouring, and to the authority, which also show that this a black and white world, "he said, to encourage the sense of writing.

Rubén has already lost two in the final against the 'Red ďáblům' from Toluky and one against Monterrey, his future rival, therefore, would like to avoid the same fate and he sacked curse, and could be celebrating a first title, although he says that, for him, is the most important institution.

In living memory the previous final, in which, as many have learned, 'we have learned the lesson that until referee nezapíská the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared to take action, as well as players, because the last time the two penaltami, we were ready to celebrate vyběhnout, and I think that we have learned, until the end of the match, we cannot celebrate. "
It is not that this series could decide in criminal stříleních, believes his players: "Never try to be a series of criminal kopů, try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and it needs to be ready in the last tournament, we are ready to have, unfortunately, but the fate of us přichystal bad move, perhaps because nervům or anxiety, which we felt was the title in our hands, but we have lost it, is something left in us and let us hope that this time, something like this to happen."
Romano is in the hands of the chance to be the second, and the taste of glory for the first time, bringing titles.

Dupont partly fool
Quebecký radio host at Stéphane Dupont suffered a setback before the Canadian Council for standard radio and television broadcasting (RRTV) because of controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to gross expression during broadcasting.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting, Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM have the right to express their views, but some of the statements included "inaccurate information on social assistance and unduly negative portray Haitians gross expression, which is broadcasting vysílanému 'during the day.
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including posting the names of the two people who have taken out life break the rules for radio broadcasts.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting has received a number of complaints relating to comments made during the broadcast, posted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after complaints EU-Sri benefeciaries Communist-front social support to secede.
The group complained that the amounts listed in broadcasting, were inaccurate.
Moderátoři must produce reliable information, not false.
When it comes to suicide, Stéphane a Dupont thought that suicide is a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that transmitted the report was that suicide can be seen as the solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The Commission believes that the most contentious episodes of Workers' treasury Dupontových reports' hit on the delicate subject of an impartial and appropriate manner."
Not against him was no conservative.
The latest controversy involving the statements that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort, gave to the media a shootout, which has produced many of the responses.
Newsweek CHOI said that no send a gift to help Haitians because we cannot know for sure that I really needed to get the money.
The Commission believes that these comments were unwarranted, but their cumulative effect of improperly creates a negative image of the Haitians.

"My daughter is intact for one and a half years," he remarked.
In all of the decisions of the Commission refuses to use in broadcasting crude expression.
In any case, the radio broadcasts CHOI-FM cooperated 'beyond their duties'.
For the station, which will have to, among other things, to announce the decision twice during the main broadcasting within three days, the consequences are minimal.

"In my case, I am looking for the matches so a little bit of everywhere, because for those who do not like the game in the country, which appears in the combat sports competition, are rare in North America."
Recently this man, who works as an assistant and stamps as for company UPS just add to their rivals the bad news, when he won two gold medals at the World Cup in the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, Edimburgu, in Scotland.

450 nasmlouvaných million without public competitions.
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering hydroelektrický Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert on the project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 of the contracts, it is made up of a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor, which have gained the most important contract, contract management of the entire project in a total of 295 million dollars without public competition.
This consortium on Énergie gérance was in 2004 zplnomocněno in parallel with the selection of companies, Hydro-Québec svěřilo to the private sector, their responsibility for the management of this significant hydroelektrického the project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005 'consortium Énergie gérance inspiured' lucrative contract without any declaration of a public competition.
For Quebeckou party complaint to a consortium of businesses before us is a serious problem of ethical character, which runs the exclusion of competition and rising prices.
"This is a new way to implement koluzi and destroy competition."
"This means that people are already doing deals in secret, now do it openly," he said yesterday, a member of the PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
A little earlier this morning, M. Simard the National Assembly to ask this question because, he says, is how hard it can be sold to the public interest in this way.
The minister for natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau afternoon, argue forcefully popírajíc it was in this contract on koluzi.
"I had my own way," hromovala and claimed that PQ was "dishonest" and "lack of rigour".
She said that "this would be the smallest 'that PQ apologised.
A recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually the alliance, limited in time, which will allow the two companies to regroup or a few of their mutual expertisy to be able to respond to the invitation to tender for a comprehensive project.
Eastmain is a very complicated project with a view to obsáhlost work.
Construction already running and must be rozvržena by 2012.
However, the treaty was introduced without competition could act; it was a trade.
Also, it must be acknowledged that same consortia is no longer the exception, and not even secede for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, consortiums in the same area in engineeringu advice is the subject of an investigation in the government.
Přelétneme-li in the speed of commercial register quebeckých firms, that will allow us to identify more than 200 consortia, while some seem to be created permanent.
Dessau this company works in partnership with the majority of its major competitors; life-say CIMA + Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the legal one and the same person, and that is the Dessau.
When it comes to the consortium Énergie gérance Minister Normandeauová underscored the fact that the 'territory la Baie James is typical of special dynamism of the labor force, and that the Hydro-Québec has responded to since the 1970's.
The main patron Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from energy companies Baie James (SEBJ), an explanation that make us svraštit front over the fact that the Treaty on the management of the project has been reached by mutual agreement.
'If jdeš to public competition and, if it is too little competition, making participants supply, tails offered prices may be higher. "
"You have a choice of two options: I.e. that sebereš the people who appear in the tender as participants in the competition, and that řekneš: 'Let us conclude a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of the people ', confirmed Mr Laporte.
This Treaty granted to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which received secede Party.
Contracts were closed to companies on a project or Hydro-Québec SEBJ Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification Le Devoir count 109 contracts for advice in the field concluded engineeringu between 2002 and March 2010, with firms or their branches, especially with the Dr., and analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin shrábl 22 contracts, Génivar of them received 16, 14 and 10 Tecsult Dessau, without should share in the 'Énergie gérance'.
All contracts were closed.
Together account for 449 783 $344, including contract companies Énergie gérance to 295 2564 $131.
Sylvain Simard, he indicated that the four firms, which are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM) and the Axor are 'very good' secede known of the Liberal Party.
Minister Normandeauová delete the message that PQ is also linked to the firms that "finance", before specify that this is more about its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - 'green' label does not inspire confidence.
More green, but openly sceptical.
Quebecký consumer confidence very few players of sustainable development, but also to the 'impartial' trust and ecological EMAS-certified, to be followed by the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even when koupeme in the media space, which urges and calls on us to the socially responsible consumption, laments the media space over a lack of credible information, a failure to act, even qualifies as a brake on its commitment to responsible consumption, says Baromètre, whose first article has emerged yesterday.
Although in 2010 increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products, the people who are trying to secede is to sell them still too believes
Two thirds of us, in fact, they say, because they do not trust the promises of the firms on the environment, simply because the green advertising companies, ascertains measuring instrument, which was drawn up by the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of all consumers have doubts about the credibility of the official certification přikládaných on the so-called fair products, but it is also about the credibility of the products and brands, which are supposed to be environmentally responsible, says Barometre.
In the same way as politicians debate on this subject is taken as a serious user-taxpayers secede 14.6% of the population.
Information about responsible consumption appears to be the first, however, to stimulate consumption revived the site currently quebeckých almost a third of the consumer.
Indeed, a vacuum and dubious nature of the information would make the enthusiasm of the 46% of consumers.
This is the second break, which identified Baromètre, after higher prices for these products.
After all, a third of the population opposes Quebekuse onward to the reported data on products or 'green' services, which are looking for is to let go of our hands.
On the other hand, in the year 2010, it was almost half of consumers willing to change their habits and particularly to change the brand of one or a few of the products, thereby respond to their beliefs.
As many as 61% of them favoring purchases for traders from their neighborhoods and prefer buying food, cultivated in their region, says Baromètre.
More 'green' and responsible - responsible consumption index is up 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québeku to itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to what the smallest impact on the environment by cares about animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: In 2010, barely 28% of the population secede said that the use of public transport or recommend the use of cars to ride at least two people, in the interests of the protection of nature.
Walking round and also supported on 39,1% of the participants in this wide-ranging survey behavior, who used this cliché.
State loan to buy complex cinemas eXcentris
Secede, which we have asked the government for financial participation to buy complex cinemas eXcentris Society Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the part, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Developperská society 'Angus et le Parallèle', which focus on the gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture in the redemption of cinematic complex on the tabloids Saint-Laurenta, which has shown its mission as milovníka film art, did as requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the dossier, but on their own terms.
The Government is proposing a gift rather than a loan to secede, which would be lower, there was the original expectations that could build the foundation for a viable solution for favourable conditions and resources coming from the state.
The first plan of action, and the requirement to 12.8 million has already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The plan of action and sent Minister St-Pierre Society president for business development in culture (SODEC), François Macerola kinematografický eXcentris, who directs the project.
The final report was sent 10 days ago.
But the government's announcement came into society SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have time until 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that hypothesis gift from the law really must be rejected.
Let us remember that, of the Association of Arts centres in cinemas and secede, punching against direct investment law, in order to promote buying eXcentrisu, judging that the culture minister, has financed the project on the property when it has done so for other kinosály.
But several of the participants in the debate on the contrary, demanded a major economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, has a room of its cinemas during the 10 years of the art of filmmaking after he funded the construction of the complex, which could be a reason for the revision of financial advice on the part of the state.
The lack of room for independent films is gaudy in Montréalu and eXcentris genius to obtain permanent clientele.
Company Angus et le Parallèle, with Christianem Yaccarini in his head, the campaign for the release of the funds in the private sector, in the belief that utrží 700 000 $protlačení for acquisitions.
In the spring of 2009, the only one of the three movie companies, Le Parallèle, continues in the distribution of films for eXcentris.
The aim is to open the future nabyvatelů again all three rooms on 27 February of next year, and to show the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Muži and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini reference to the Le Devoir and ignores, with he and his group thinks about the proposals for the reduction, which are made to him.
Zvednutá Curtain in Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources in America, known by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regarded as Canadians inferiority complex against the Americans, but the same whiplash reveal their sense of superiority the latter appointed to Canada.
American diplomats are wondering why that every Canadian voters lies at the heart of the kanadsko-americké relations, when it comes to vote, and I believe that President Obama's visit to a Conservative government to its budget was adopted in 2009!
Four of the new report, which were American ambasádou in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday, the sheer look at the public, provide sensitive details, to each other "under the skin".
Communication with the date of 22 September 2008, in the middle of an election campaign, specify at what point the United States is not part of the betting, which discussed the political leaders.
To the surprise of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkinse.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations to this situation.
'Canadian inferiority complex, almost utkvělý, perhaps making political leaders to speak about internal betting instead to realise that these elections will also apply to the United States (as in the campaign to free trade in 1988), "she writes.
"The United States is a 'closed' elephant mine in these elections: Ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about them.
Ambasador understand this' ohlušujícímu 'silence on less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or, even better, the head of the party to follow these important relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of the importance of this can be read in the report, which was sent on 22 January 2009, Terry Breese, Charge d'Affaires in Ottawa at Ottawa preparing President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
'Your trip will help to ensure the preservation of the government in a confidence vote at the beginning of February, on the federal budget, which Canada publicly acknowledge its first deficit for more than ten years, because of the recovery plan of $30 billion to $40 billion, "writes M. Breese.
Not a mention of the fact that the government has had to shelve pre-Christmas session of Parliament that could not be defeated coalition and that the opposition parties in terms of their survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from the January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkinsem, highlights Washington on ever more negative image, which the United States cast a dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
Ambasador is concerned about the broadcasts BMW Swan Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be seen not too ingenious references to the Syrian Arar, 'or' No-Fly-List also on the abduction for the purposes of violent interrogation for the CIA.
Another report on how well that, during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton to ask his French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is ready to accept some of the detainees from Guantánamo Bay.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of 'a case-by-case basis. "
At the end of the meeting, it says, 'to give a paper on Omar Khadr, a Canadian 15-letého Muslim origin, the Secretary of State. "
'Secretary accepted that component of the term'.
Public-private finally, that those concerned with WikiLeaks, palms.
The Flanagan, a former advisor to very close to the Stephen Harperovi, said waves on CBC, the person responsible for this massive capital should be "destroyed".
Rozhlásilo it and sounds, and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to restore the lighting
Yesterday the UN has proposed a plan in Cancun on the recovery of the domestic lighting, lighting stores and industrial space in 100 countries, with the aim of limiting the greenhouse effect (GES), which is the equivalent of nearly one third of further restrictions, which is needed to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of big concrete projects, which wants to push the UN in Cancun, to compensate for the lack of a viable difficult to reduce commitments on the part of the industrialised countries.
Yesterday, according to the plan, if heated monopolize light bulbs which still 50% to 70% of the market, replacing žárovkami fluokompaktními or, even better, žárovkami with elektroluminiscentními diodami (del or 'LEDs' in English), the principal amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) GES high-growth-rate emissions on the planet because of the lighting would odbouralo.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, the big countries with a significant share of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, involved in voluntary plans to reduce, which should enable the decline in global emissions of 53 GES GT to 49 GT.
But it will need to be added to the balance sheets of even the 5 GT, to be achieved by the year 2020, stabilizing the climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude that get out of control.
In rozžhavených 95% of the energy, especially with the rest in the form of heat and rest, i.e. 5%, it is the product of the lights.
With fluokompaktními žárovkami energy consumption reduced by 75%, and with new žárovkami with del, zredukujeme this consumption even twice.
Fluokompaktní bulbs last, on average, from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New light bulbs with del, which said this week in the production of Philips - this company allegedly participated in a study by the United Nations - have estimated life span of 25 000 hours and consumes about 80% less energy than rozžhavená light bulb, which gives us a picture of the possible compensation Energy-saving with the plan, which would be aplikoval in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with reostaty and exudes less heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Some experts expressed reservations about the fluokompaktním žárovkám, because they contain mercury, and it needs to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still possible in developing countries unless manufacturers have established sběrny.
But, as the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is fluokompaktní light bulb, but rather thermo-insulation coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity needed in the teeth, especially rozžhavených.
Only in the United States, these headquarters put into circulation 25 000 tons of mercury each year.
The report also detailed the profits, which would make this the international agenda each country.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
The Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, claimed the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast following the expiration of the set deadlines.
"The Secretary-General of the need for independent Electoral Commission has completed its work and immediately announced the preliminary results of stress, the spokesman for the president of the United Nations."
'Calls on all parties in the Ivory Coast and institutions to their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results. "
Despite the pressures, made some foreign governments allowed the electoral commission to pass the ultimate date - Wednesday midnight - without results, published three days after Sunday's skrutiniu.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline President CEI in television confirmed that the Commission "continues to work 'to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, all over the world have challenges that CEI finally declared the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and Ouattara Alassanem a member of the opposition.
But Gbagbo camp is counting on the nullification of Constitutional Council for 'misleading' vote in the north, which is administered by the former rebels of the New Army (FN) from the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Djamena Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the intimidation of voters, which practiced the FN (A) and the army in the north of the country, deterring supporters, the president of the Ivory Coast to go to vote.
Elections could be avoided if the Constitutional Council close to the complaint, which filed a Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo have for the fact that the Supreme Court is not a neutral country, since it is governed by Paul Yao N'Djamena Dré, very close to the political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man from the north, which dementuje any links with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of results as' unacceptable 'and asked Gbagba that is respected, but sets so far that it demanded victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, because he knows that suffered a loss, and that the file a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after defending the election commission odvysílat results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, the ongoing on Sunday, was seen as a coronation process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that for years has been split into two half.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the political faction of the Ivory Coast that could be made responsible for the violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner, with 38% of the votes compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattaru, which has received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Show how the French leaders sought to persuade Washington that the release of a young French was compensation against release Majida Kakavanda, Iranians held in France and hledaného American justice for illicit trafficking of material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, the effectiveness of the sharp světlu way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to akreditovali idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad, has played a central role in the liberation of Klotildy Reissové.
In fact, it has not done anything.
Diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran: The French comments on the way for a solution in the case of the hostages".
From the Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Afrikua the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the head of US diplomacy Allegrone.
He explains the French method.
I recommend the Americans do, as much for that dopraven back to the country of their own nationals violence detained in Iran.
Do 'noise', they say, 'keep strongly vyslovujte' in the media, the words' fundamental rights of man ',' innocence ',' 'immediate release.
There is a need to bring in trouble the Iranian regime, is sensitive to its image.
'Do it all the more, the more you will ask you to stop. "
As attempts were made to the negotiations through diskrétních channels' silence solves nothing, "the Iranians are masters at 'evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier recalls that the arrests of foreigners is' Iranian family tactic: Taking hostages for political purposes "blackmail".
Announcing that the liberation of Klotildy Reissové (which will come on 16 August in the day when it will provide refuge in the French embassy) are also represented 'will require large sums of money to pay for the Iranians' 230, 000 euros (dollars).
And announce that get palace anticipuje hostage cases, the phenomenon of 'which will vyostřovat'.
The Iranians' could, in the future other arrested about 1,800 people living in Iran, "it says.
On 28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left prison for 12 days, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Majid Kakavand man, which the United States claim that he was deported for illegal trade with the sensitive electronic equipment in relation to Iran, is in Paris is released on the basis of a decision of the judge.
The US Embassy, as well as many observers questioning on this worrying consensus.
For Washington, which is illegal, the Iranian network to obtain materials for a nuclear programme, is pitting Majida Khakavanda the bad news.
France settled for bargaining?
The liberation of Iranians for the liberation of a young French?
In another interview with suggests Allegrone 4 September, François Richier assures that is not the case.
Get the palace, as it says, has not only been "shocked by the decision of the judge," but sought a chance to stand up against that.
"Talks have been held between the presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie, the French government), but "cannot change the decision of the court," it notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is' limited 'under the supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser vytáčí telephone number zavěšuje telephone handset and then informs the American top that man is currently in Paris buildings administered the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of the arrests Klotildy Reissové in Iran is making efforts to get the palace, negotiating through the communiqué and organised "leaks" in the media, in order to persuade the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has' important 'and' influential 'role as a' facilitator '.
Americans see this kind of activity is not without irony, and stating that the manipulation of bears fruit, because a number of articles in the press that reflects French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009, suggesting the media 'blest' French officials'.
The rate is based on a "debt of gratitude" to vyjadřovaná M. Assadovi, asks Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their declarations full chvalořečí French official officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians in fact done '.
The document will then deals with the reasons that forced the palace to pay get in this fiction.
Intense communication "is heading for the Validation policies of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria," analyses.
The policy pursued in 2008 'was pozorována many critical voices in France and abroad, and marked as premature and stars'.
The exaggeration ', as the Syrian role, "Paris is trying to" demonstrate Syria, what can advance, when it plays a constructive role in the region ".
It also aims to "instill grain nesváru between Syria and Iran.
American represented knows it from a very good resources.
11 August, François Richier, he confessed: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians do something, whether it is anything '.
"But yet we thanked them. '
"This should at least bring chaos and confusion between the Iranians'.
Klotilda Reissová returning to France on 16 May 2010.
It is Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace.
In a communiqué thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria, for their 'active role in favour of the liberation of our krajanky'.
The end of online games for young Korean after midnight.
But South Korean government adopts a law called 'Peciválský' which will prohibit adolescentům play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December, so that he can ask the companies operating online games to block access to these Games after midnight, the younger persons 16 years, said the leaders of the ministry of culture and the Treasury for the family.
"Many children playing these games all night and then have problems with learning in school, and they are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary for it to be ensured their health and their right to sleep," said AFP for Jo Rin, a leading official at the State Department, which is in charge of the draft law.
Online games are newly available since 6 o'clock this morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, the accusation.
The Government also assumes that it will ask the company to limit daily time access to these games for young people whose parents request it, added a responsible worker.
It can also be available to people who request it, free of charge, to reduce the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by 'and' daily press regularly brings different facts associated with the intensity of the use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in the world championships in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, and in the face of the 58 other nations.
The World Cup: The FIFA in 2018-2022 establishes the host country.
Full of unrest because of suspicion of corruption laid FIFA's executive committee on Thursday, the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the choice of sovereignly politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risk being overtaken by the technical criteria.
Thing is certain, the Royal competition in the 2007 FIFA 2018se will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Španělsko-Portugalsko, Nizozemí-Belgie).
In the year 2022 World Cup will be much exotičtější, while the International Federation is hoping that it can conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its opening night on the African continent in 2010, or continue to take place in the United States or to the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of people who will take part in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives us the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the economic and political betting around the world.
The negotiations behind the scenes, faces the risk that will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish the hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the reports of the FIFA documentation English, španělsko-portugalská (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons not to have too much weight to the 22 members of the executive Commission in the hour of the vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to suspendování / CE two members of the European Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adam) may destroy the chances of their country, the birthplace of the football, which has hosted the World Cup just once, in a year.
The BBC on Monday, deploying the crown when broadcast document 'wriggling on špendlík' CE (three influential members of the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz, and Issa Hayatou.
How to make the FIFA nespokojenou and bring into difficulty English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move, which was made by his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, which in 2005, has managed to obtain the organisation for the London Olympic Games in 2012.
This intense activity will be enough for England to add a new luster to his name on the European Commission's CE (?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the twin Španělsko-Portugalsko chips is already prepared stadiums, his bill (the World Cup in Spain in 1982, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions cold sprchu.
Possible retaliatory measures against default today and doubts about the capacity of Spain and Portugal have only increased the position of Russia, which was an outsider, despite the gap in its documentation (stadiums, hotels and transport).
But the Prime Minister, Vladimir Poutin decided that the World Cup into Curichu nepřemístí and publicly declared "unfair competition" in the run-up to the vote, in the verbal insinuation hardly pokroucených on the English press charges against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We are going after them, we are going to try to tar blátem is fearsome," said Mr Poutin.
For the year 2022, seem to be a logical favourite in the United States with significant experience in 1994.
The performance of the economy in the world, the seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country has a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which separately, vyhotovily beautiful project.
But these candidacy appear to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002, in particular, have suffered "test."
Another threat: The World Cup 2026 China, which has warmly wants FIFA made Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With Katarem, which pulled out of a major bargaining chip in the form of a futuristic stadium, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries are more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pykat for weak charges TV (because of the time shift) paid European countries, as a driving force for the FIFA.
A second mandate: Zřejmost (security).
De Gaulle really hesitate.
Mitterrand aroused the appearance that Hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
Mandate Elysejskému Palace calling someone else.
The current head of state, will be a candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost not in good line with the proportion of the secrecy of the posts.
It is to be done, as the doubts constantly persisted.
In one sense, in the second.
In 2006, without this trust, Jacques Chirac friends wanted to make claims to a third mandate has not been ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that 'sometimes decide in the autumn of 2011.
As reminiscent of members of parliament from the UMP Wednesday evening in the Élysée Palace, the prospect of the 'two mandates' planted little horečný situation.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not far from that.
Just to remind the president that the adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 to limit the number of pictures of the two terms of office.
It was from his party only 8.2.2, no announcement.
This is not the first time at such meetings humorným reminiscent of the tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you are still seven and a half years with me ', threw in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: 'Do not think that neuvažuji to the next stage. "
His předvčerejší statements do not make him a candidate more than the previous day; it is not a candidate or less.
If we give the comments, this is due to the double the truth.
Speeding up the journey to bid to the PA, on the one hand.
But this does not enter the ring Ségolèna Royala what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is, therefore, that his candidacy in 2012, it is obvious that many of the PA want in order to combat assemblies rather premature than intended.
A survey on the other side.
Firstly, voters would prefer candidacy right, Francois Fillon, before the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the Express BVA-L ').
'We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP, "responded immediately and break from the nearest people around the Prime Minister.
"If possible, believes the defeat will not stand," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
'Will continue to believe that we can win, "Alain Juppé repairs, balanced with zřejmostí.
The euro: The European Central Bank to continue its purchases of titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central in 2009 should be an opportunity for a clarification of the conditions for the lifting of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges Institute for issuing securities will undoubtedly will not be able to afford to be so categorical under threat of deterioration of the situation in the already tense on the European markets, with the securities.
The political cost, in this case, it was higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde to pay tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of a solution to the crisis claims European states.
It did not say whether he thinks that the bank could do more, for example, that it would increase its program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my account for my European partners (...)."
The night before, in Brussels, when his interrogation of a Commission for economic and monetary affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has showed as výřečnější regarding its intentions, and downshifted that said that the programme of buying state titles on the secondary market, "continues", and that "we will see how we will decide 'during the meeting, which is being held this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep a sharp eye on their basic fixed interest rate to 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the underlying bond purchases from the European Central Bank, in the last week, have doubled to almost 1,35 billion euros.
And thanks to the impracticality dohodců in the market for new purchases made yesterday, Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central banks have bought the Eurosystem to 67 billion euros from May 2010.
Between dohodci anticipace in the market about the continuation of the purchases they bar no doubt see Party (29).
Even the economists do not expect any significant change in the rate.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, the Bank of the latter is appointed to the unlimited provision of liquidity, according to the generous terms and duration from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that this would significantly changed their agenda."
"If not, it would mean to take the risk of provoking a short new tensions," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
'Progressive way announced during the first quarter of 2011, it seems likely, "added Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the market with the public debt, "to the European Central Bank to keep the volume of purchase of its bonds to revive sluggish market," joins Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to the markets of sovereign debt in the euro zone continue to have no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market.
'Needs at any price to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way to prevent the outbreak spreading borrower-paid States belonging among the most fragile, "testified yesterday, a bond manager.
Because if interest rates vzlétly, States on this matter more to reduce its debt, rather than stabilise it.
It is saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi hrbí back.
After the beginning of the week for the Italy worrying the situation a bit, released yesterday by the Flux obligačních interest for 10 years.
A return to the temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the prime minister for the economy and the regions have said that they have heard Giulio Tremonti, as defined the situation as a 'nerozřešitelnou' expected 'and' unexpected weekend, which then zúčastněny dementoval.
In any event, on Tuesday, deviation from the long German payments reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of contracts to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points in Rome, which has caused some excitement.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain deviation with the German interest rates were higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, by Gianni Letta, in itself, has said that it is' too occupied 'development' turbulent markets and the possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, a third of the economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland '.
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and nešifrovaně, its problem is the lack of growth and weak fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts were for the Government to Brussels cold shower.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget, which is available on its analysis of the Senate, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, plays the European Commission, will represent the deficit in public finances even 4.3% of gross domestic product in the next year (3.9%), and the government projected 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of the new additions to a summary of the state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, a $7 billion euros.
"If it is needed, will have to be adopted stringent new measures' judge Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
'The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time, "assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term because, despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), is the effort to stabilize the required in Italy smaller than the effort required from other countries' notes, Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE chief economist.
The question remains of political instability.
14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and then after that it can begin to organise the elections, which is at the end of March.
Launched this period, little appropriate for the decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde, yesterday again underlined in a press conference in Paris: "I think that the Europeans on Sunday demonstrated throughout the day and night, and are obviously very sympathetic determined committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone '.
Although everything is relative, yesterday, noted the expansion of the interest in European government bonds, produced water at the hands of governments and the European Central Bank.
But we cannot yet speak about normalization of the beginning.
Office for notaci Standard & Poor's announced that could record a debt downgrade of Portugal, the goal of which is most focused different speculation.
'Because in May is a real lack of transparent and clear policy, especially in the banking systems, "says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
The more that 'political clock is ticking more slowly than the time of the market'.
Aware of this danger and adjourned, which hides, intensifying the debate, European countries to strengthen the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale, with their counterparts from the G20, they are going very well.
And with regard to the meeting of the Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and clustering of Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the eurozone, with a focus on markets (see above).
When it comes to the European fund of the Treasury (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, zapořčal on Tuesday in Singapore the way to Asia, to inform investors from the Far East on the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the purpose of this trip is to raise funds, they certainly the way to achieve this goal.
The first emissions securities FESF is foreseen for next month.
Yesterday's official representative of the agency, told Reuters that the United States will support any increase in funds mobilized additional direct engagement in the FMI.
The country, which it is, first and foremost, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, especially when it comes to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms to join the strict measures with the rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid different path than use Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid at all costs that have requested international assistance before they apply their own budgetary korektivy and before deciding on the structural reforms needed to once again have a permanent confidence.
Participants in the capital of the European funds finally talk about the options, clampdown for accelerating the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.

Subways Grand Paris: The first of the financial proposals.
Since when is a discussion about the modernisation of transport on the Ile-de-France in full swing, rain billion.
At least during the discussion.
We particularly 23 billion on subways Grand Paris, which is to build a society Société du Grand Paris.
To this construction could be launched, announced the state providing subsidies amounting to 4 billion euros.
In the abstract, it is amount, which would then allow the companies to use part of the financing of the SGP on the orders of its double resources.
Now, finally, we come to the first amendments.
Rektifikační law on the finances of the year 2010, which investigates financial committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set to guarantee these funds.
There are two: The creation of a special tax on equipment and increase taxes on the offices of the Ile-de-France.
First, because, in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is in favour of public institutions Société du Grand Paris'.
It is calculated that: "The revenue from this interest is 117 million euros a year.
The second is the rates for the office, which already exists "to be modernised, to increase the revenue it generated for this increase and affect companies Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it brought?
A pipe dream.
This is not the vyčísleno in the text.
We have far to 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources to go to 4 billion euros of capital subsidies, which will be mobilised by the state and put into society Société du Grand Paris, according to the project", can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We in society SGP this system seems shocking.
"From the moment when we created the income taxes (both), can cover ndlr study for three years and then hrábnout to 4 billion, explains here. '
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used my needs."
Society SGP is that 4 billion will připsány up in 2013 for the year 2014.
This mechanism, which promised 4 billion are still absent abonentům, risks causing a lot of parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Mstiví hackers and přičinliví vyzvědači
The case of the WikiLeaks has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal exposed the scandal, which seems to be the only scandal in the face of the hypocrisy of the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it says everything about the profound changes in the international level, and anticipates future ruled by the regression.
But let us move popořádku.
The first aspect of the WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document drawn up by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively from press cuts.
'Extraordinary revelations about the way the Americans' sexual life Berlusconi is announcing what they have for months, everyone could read newspapers (all embarked in addition to these two Berlusconi own), and the infamous karikaturní profile Kadáfího was already long for the cabaret artist device for skeče.
The rule, according to secret documents which may consist only of reports already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go to a bookstore, which devotes ezoterické literature, you will see that each work repeats (Graalu, záhadě Rennes-le-Château, Templářích or Zednářích) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only that, the author of the occult texts are not after new information (not even know where to look for the report on the non-existent), but because those who devote occultists believes only do what they know, and what this confirms what previously learned.
This is a mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
The same is true of secret documents.
Informátor is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit), the head of the secret service (and if not, it could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération), which considers the true only what he admits.
With high confidential information about Berlusconi, the American Embassy sent home state, were the same that Newsweek published a week before.
So, why is the revelation of these documents likely much fuss?
On the one hand, to say what everyone already knows, cultured man, and that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since when can the heads of state of the phone or on the plane to fly a joint dinner, lost its diplomatic post and, with the exception of a few small exercise in representation have been transformed in the center of a spy.
Any viewer watching films on investigations knows very well that, just from this seemingly ignoring crumble.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly vilified duty hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain classified information the most powerful country in the world is a tough blow, not significant, for prestige of this state home.
Scandal affects both victims, as well as his' prompting '.
But let us move on from there to the profound truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell, it was possible to hold all the power, like a big brother, who controlled every movement of its people.
Orvellovo prophecy has been demonstrated since the ability to control every movement, every transaction, thanks to the phone's session, the hotel, used the motorway, and so on and so forth, has become a victim of a Russian citizen of absolute power.
But when demonstrujeme, as is happening now, that even the 'information' tomb with nejtajnějšími powerful cannot resist intervention some hackera control the report, it is no longer a one-way street and becoming oběžníkem.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as mstitel citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can maintain power, which is no longer able to maintain its own secrecy?
It is true that the already Georg Simmel, said that the real mystery is bereft secrecy (and bereft secrets will never be able to be detected); it is also true that all the information on the nature of the Berlusconi or Merkel is really meaningless ran secret because it is vytaženo from public life; but to discover, as I did, that the secret of WikiLeaks Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými legend, means odnímat him all the power.
WikiLeaks did no mistake with Sarkozy and Merkel, but carried something great Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of the wounds inflicted powers so significant?
It is clear that, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be tantamount to its publication vylepeném on a poster on a street corner.
But it is also quite clear that the current technology is useless to hope that we can maintain the secrecy of the news over the phone.
There is nothing better than to find out if and when the head of state, traveling by plane and teamed up with some of his colleagues.
How will in future be maintained in secret private and sensitive news?
Well, I know that, for the moment, has forecast falls into science fiction, and therefore, it is fantastic, but I imagine the government officials who transported discreetly after the formalities of uncontrollable routes and wear only those reports that they know by heart, or rather rare hide information in podpatku shoes.
The information will be retained in unikátních copies in zásuvkách closed the key: By and large, the attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write, that the technology is now moving forward, and that means moving elsewhere.
A century later, when the wireless telegraph mean a revolution in communications, Internet Milosevic-era telegraph based on drátech (the telephone).
Videokazety (analogové) enabled milovníkům Italian cinema film, step by step, move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets of a while now CDs (číslicové) allow only switch after chapters that means after makroporcích.
Through the ingenuity fast from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the road and air transport, which includes need three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that a policy and communications technology, will come back to the cars behind horses.
The last comment.
Sometimes the press to try to understand what happened in secret by the Israeli Embassy.
Now the embassy, which require confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hackla on the financing of its promises.
A year after the Copenhagen agreement is the time to try to respect promises to quickly odblokovaná funding (řečená with the fast start financing (fast start) or premature), by developed countries.
And the great French hacky were uncovered.
In the Copenhagen agreement with developed countries committed to provide $30 billion for 2010-12 years.
The European Union has promised to 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the launch of the EU's big ace COP16 draws to persuade its partners on the practicalities of its commitment to the fast start financing: The report detailed action of its member states, the press conference, the grand side event, distributing brožurek...
Transparent operation inestimable and overpriced on their real value: The developed countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries and civil society do the same, with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU is announcing that 2010 release 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on track to honour its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we see that things are much more complex.
These funds are, in the Copenhagen agreement "new and additional" to ensure that it is done, without increased burden would be to the detriment of Public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what it means to "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed the harmonisation of some member states, among others, as well as France, the process down.
Today everyone chooses a reference here, which suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, was deemed a reference 2009: International financing to maintain it, and to make it even adds 150 million in three years, as the financing of the fast start.
Other countries choose similar reference to the annual payment dates or with dates on the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France has for funding for 'all new projects' 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous term or to global level Public aid for development d Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of aid to developing countries, France can stay the same (or even lower), has to keep his commitment to funding the "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division of the gifts and loans.
There is no rule, and everyone can choose its own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, considering that loaned €1 to €darovanému 1.
Obviously, it is difficult to verifiable: Contriving přirovnatelná is not.
If the loans can be proven for certain investments, which are cost-effective (often on projects related to the reduction in emissions, a combination of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one of the euro, which come as the equivalent of one euro, which we..., we should not be seen from the title of their obligations, but as the cost of borrowing for creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only give a recital: 'Respect' their commitment of $420 million euros, making 91.5% of the loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36,1 million euros) - see the document the EU to think that they can be verified.
It is the only country in the European Union, which on the scale uses the loan.
Germany has claimed 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) to abide by its commitments to 100% of the donation.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union to €1 on the satisfaction of its promise to give France only 10 centimů and considers this effort for comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský piece!
In summary, in their financing 'fast start' France operates with dual šejdířstvím: On the one hand with the development of the shares at the time, and on the other hand, with real financial burdens.
Although spends only 36,1 million euros, can persuade that publishes 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to their promises.
Manipulation finance minister (because it seems to me that, although it is the Bercy, who was such a decision) could have a double negative impact at the same time within the EU (why should the Member States to continue to donate, when I only need to borrow?) and in the negotiations because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on the early financing is little otázečkou, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of discussions about the change.
But it could be a crumb of sand in a huge machine, which is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to this is the first year of funding.
Possible should France to announce the change in the way of leadership on accounting EU-sourced years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for their commitment and decency and fairness to other European Union countries.
But above all, France should avoid discussion of deposits into the long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): The issue of 'labors dodatečnosti' or posting on how loans.
France should change its attitude that has become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as it is on the other.
Hope is all stuff into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizetové, which arrives in Cancunu next week.
The surprising announcement on the fast start and France about its vision of 'dodatečnosti' and the use of loans could cause an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to be able to continue to make progress in the discussions.
The alarm on pesticides, which children have digested.
České gobbles a child one day, 81 of different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of future generations (ex- Movement for rights and preservation of the future generations).
The association, which points out that its results are strong statistical value in the light of the small number of samples analysed, but are characterised zpracovávanou issue ', bought between July and September, food normally consumed in four dishes and one easy meal as lightly svačinu on one child roughly 10-year in supermarkets in l Oise and in Paris.
This typical dishes, including official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as cookies were analysed Dr. on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants officials.
The balance sheet is heartbreaking dishes: 81 chemical substances, 42, is among possible carcinogenic substances, or likely, and five agents are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances which could act as a disruptive for cancer, with the internal endocrine (PE), according to the studies of the few institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are exceeded in our research well, we can see that the reality in exposure to consumers, possibly carcinogenic substances kontaminujícím and / or odd it is amazing," says the association.
Breakfast butter and tea with milk contain themselves about ten résiduí with possible carcinogenic effects and three identified as a carcinogen, as is the case with about 20 MRLs that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The bones, imported from Brazil, cited studies as a small svačinka contains traces of six chemicals, including in France banned fungicidní a means to an end.
The same is true for green fazolky of Kenyi, lunch included in the study, which appeared in the footprints of the strong insecticides banned in the EU.
Moreover, biftek of minced meat in a tuna, and even houska and chewing gum were punctuated with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroformu.
The salmon steak for dinner was' richest 'with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even analysis plastového plates used to ohřátí food in the microwave oven no analysis.
The final risk for consumers' kontaminujících of a cocktail of substances' is probably the most underestimated, "results from the study.
The war-party eco-modernisation Evropa-Zelení (EE-LV) proposed 'in the face of the urgent situation' to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the rise of civilisation 'disease'.
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has been investigating the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, from 76 in cereáliích.
