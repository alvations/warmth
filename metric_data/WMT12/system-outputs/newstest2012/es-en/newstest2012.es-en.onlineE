The parliament did not support an amendment to free to Tymoshenko
The Parliament of Ukraine has rejected today the proposal to abrogate the amendment of the section of the Penal Code in which is condemned the leader of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko.
The modification would open the doors to the release of the exprimer minister, but the parliamentary rejected the proposal to reduce the griefs by economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the presumed firm of an agreement with Russia unfavorable for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas.
The sentence not yet is firm, the court of appeal has the obligation to revise it in December.
Tymoshenko was shown convinced that was a matter of a political revenge of the state, and even in West doubts on the impartiality of the court have arisen.
The proposal that withdrew the paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with the one that was condemned the former prime minister was supported by 147 representatives in the voting.
For its approval 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The history of the liberation Libya, or of the rebellion Libya, already has its losers.
Muammar the-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him already there is not war.
It remains for defining who is the winner
As it is already custom in the region, the pro-islamic won the elections, but now is a matter of clarifying if is a matter of moderates or radical
The National Counsel of Transition has done to go into effect the traditional law, the sharía, that already in a way know.
Libya will become a country without delinquency, because to the thieves will be cut them the hand.
The women already can go forgetting of being emancipated and the apostates expecting their execution and so on.
In place by the person of the dictator, the company, composed of tribes army jackets, will unite for the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that us not neither to imagine and that certainly do not we be able.
Nevertheless, our form of life is not neither the unique one neither objectively the best and, probably, did not agree, on the other hand, the Libyans already mentioned.
The certain thing is that not to stops surprising that the Islamic combatants accepted you thanked the aid of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, since their point of view, the attacks of the NATO not an American, but large general directed them be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each one of the successful interventions.
When winners in Libya are sought, West is not among them.
We are trapped in a cross-fire of the one that are served the pro-islamic and our politicians to be get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without there be guarantees to obtain benefits.
After the recent evils experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, to the localities does not suppose a problem to expel to the "crusaders"
But, without occupation ¿they will obtain the tankers to be done with the oil alone Libyan with good words?
It is quite possible not, but can be that finally West can presume to protect the human rights.
Provided that the followers of the sharía they be not crossed us.

Daily menu of an obese boy: does not have breakfast and to have supper stuffed
More than one third of the children with ages understood between the 9 and 13 years have problems of excess, where the excess affects to the 9% of the school population and the obesity to the 5%.
The obese children proceed mostly of families with a way of life that is not healthy, according to is removed of current investigations.
It is shown again which is the importance of the environment where grows itself for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve of reference.
On the table, the obsessed children are fed, for example, of stuffed at least with the double one of frequency that the children of families with normal weight.
To have dinner, more than the 19% of the obese french fries had dinner the day before the analysis, which is linked to the program of prevention "The obesity is not a coincidence".
In the families of children with excess not custom to practice sports exists, which is applicable to the majority of the where alone, current families the 15% of the children responded that their parents, at least once a week, they find time for the physical exercise.
Survey carried out to 900 children
The survey was carried out to ends of the past school year and they participated in the same one almost 900 children of Basic Education of every Chequia.
Already it was the second edition of the program of "The obesity of is not a coincidence", that supports the General Sanitary insurance Company and the business Unilever.
Up to now, they have participated in the project more than 12 thousand children since the 4º to the 8º course.
A diet adequate and enough exercise in family are determinant factors, that cause they diminish notably the number of children with excess and even obesity.
"Alone the half of the polled children they have responded that they have five daily foods according to the state: breakfast, lunch, food, afternoon snack and supper, that is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", collects one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast but with stuffed to have dinner
The specialists notify that, in a healthy development, they are important, besides, the details, that also count, as for example to have a fixed hour for the breakfast in family.
In Chequia, nevertheless, alone the 23% of the families of students they have breakfast to the same hour.
In the majority of the families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worse thing was to discover that in the 10% of the homes has breakfast nothing.
The breakfast is, nevertheless, the base of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children they are consumed with a lot of more frequency the insane french fries.
Almost all - independently of the weight - drink daily sweet refreshments (70%).
By guideline they do sport more than the 40% of the polled children, nevertheless, among its parents this result is reduced to less than the half, alone the 15%.
You manufacture you your diet
The following phase of the study enabled that the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) were created their own diets from all the possible offerings according to their inclinations and opinions.
"The eating preferences of the Czech children in ages understood between the 12 and 15 years, since the point of view of a healthy diet, they are very far away of the ideal thing."
Among their favorite food the paste, the meat and the candies are found
"It is above all alarming the popularity of the sweet refreshments", is notified in the final report of the study.
As main food is carried the palm the paste and the meat of bird continues him closely.
Practically, the children reject always the legume and the flavor by the fish and the greenness is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that the children are willing to change its eating habits if receive the just information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, that filled the questionnaire after finishing the program of prevention" The obesity is not a coincidence", was given in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet", is aimed in the results of the study.
It calls the attention, for example, the relating to the sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer the current and normal water.
The children would also elect with more frequency in the questionnaire the meat of bird and the fish for the main food and they would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the by-products of flour.
The stylist should be also a good psychologist, they maintain the professionals
In the introductory article, How do they learn the stylists, already I complained a little that the initial lessons already were quite loaded.
Did not have neither idea of how would go that.
Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress problematic personages and, besides, a seminar on how functions in the show business.
And will be worse.
The more fence they are the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course develops each Saturday and Sunday, no longer fits a pin.
We are time we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how dress the woman that does not have a perfect symmetry.
And thus is the great majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a figure stylized without the adequate curves and someone suffers excess.
The stylist should know to smooth out optically some wide shoulders, to extend a neck or to amuse the necessary curves
Certain tricks have given us on how cause to emphasize the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of chests and enormous hips but waist I tighten and at the same time not to dress it of a too defiant way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or the pants do not adapt, is worth while to cause to sew at least an extra fabric piece to measure.
Without doubt they will not repent, because the clothes that sits down perfectly is unpayable.
With a skirt to measure he will feel a lot better than with a that not for to be moved, to be raised, he dances in the waist, etc.
The body stylized can be permitted to dress clothes with folds, decorations, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many types of diverse informations and of bodies, so I am happy that I have all the week to sort out my head all this information.
And even thus, I am afraid that with the task assigned, already I have more than to spare.
To each participant in the course they have been assigned him two famous, to the ones that should design two wardrobes: one for the day and another for the night.
One must keep in mind the current aspect, the fashionable style that be adapted the person in question.
It has touched me "to dress" to Miranda Kerr, perhaps know it of the campaign of Victory' s Secret.
Shout inside, for me is a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Eyrie, that ultimately there will be grown fat some a hundred kilograms (please, they keep in mind the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gómez.
The dresses we have to trim them of the magazines or to seek them on the internet and to print them, for later devise them graphic.
The moodboard, that is like is called to the espresso, complete result besides our personal style and our relation with the graphic design.
Is important also to think about the graphic part of the fashion design.
The stylist, therefore, did not you see alone physically, but also is occupied, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (of concrete themes, like tendencies, bags, shelters, etc.).
Of all it spoke us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this already remains for Sunday.
The stylist should have a global vision.
The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with informations above all type of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashionable photographer Ben.
Jakub recalled us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know him to remove party to this.
And a good stylist knows to work with a same article of clothing of diverse forms.
The changeability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the such raincoat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can dress to it classic with cattlemen and undershirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with high-heeled shoes and to photograph it as if were in reality a dress.
Or well it suffices to tuck it and to rise the neck to obtain a completely different image.
"You play with it", he insisted us.
What more I value is the following counsel: "To begin to work, does lack that first know all the rules".
"Then already you can break them", he said Jakub.
At last it remains me clearly why do we memorize all those formulae, what combines with what, why, if then it so happens that in the fashion magazines we find us different results.
That without speaking of the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve of the one that intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashionable history that have ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), one must have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes functions in combination with other tokens, all they different to the ones that are used in the reality.
All it one must keep in mind at the moment of to design the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and the style suppose they alone, in many cases, the half of the success.
Suffices to look at to Madonna, that is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have done of her a world star.
In Chequia, for the moment, there is not still a clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
To the famous personages also they find the useless (my abilities suffice me, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
And when someone ask us our services, one must keep in mind that is very probable that they indicate us a very different size to his real (smaller).
Then alone it remains guglear and to ascertain if the gossip magazines already have written on the theme, if a certain fame grows fat/makeed thin, etc.
Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted us that to the stylist does not suffice him to be oriented in the fashion, but he has to understand of outfit.
During its work, above all should communicate with the people to which you saw, for which is fundamental to be a good psychologist.
It knows to value to the people, itself is not done of less, defends its opinions.
"When a director hires you so that classify him the wardrobe and are completed it with pretty tokens, cannot catch and to throw everything that there was and to say: "Huy what horror"".
"You find at least a pair of things that can praise and to recommend so that someone can be put them", he says Mario.
He himself also showed us that all he should fit in the call "placovka", that is to say, the market of work.
This themselves fixed around the waist and have there all the necessary tools.
They are objects like scissors, as scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There is also thread of nylon (that serves the stylist during the products photos session such that bags or caps), special pincers of coupling of tokens in front, if this was greater (the pins and another type of couplings they are not permitted, therefore they would be able to damage the weaving), or a play of dressmaking.
For remain us not in it passive listens and to put something in practice, we have learned to cover the sole with the shoes.
Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and a lot more still the outside.
And we did not do more than covering and to cover.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors for damage them not by accident.
So there was that to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a happiness upon praising my work without reserves.
The truth is that themselves they are not given me very well those abilities.
This is alone a small part of all the ones that have listened during all the weekend, in the second part of the course.
Already I have given me account that to dedicate me to the fashion design to professional level is not a road of rose, but gives me exactly equal what the people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes for every America.
It reviews
A trip, in unworried principle, is complicated on account of a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during the shift of tomorrow.
To a certain extent managed to cover itself the expectations, but it does not serve you're welcome, if, in reality, did not intend to do extraordinary nothing.
The new delivery, to which to the title is added The Run, awoke large expectations already before its premiere.
It promised that would give new air to the old saga of careers Need for Speed and, because of it shown, appears like a play that should not finish being again a kind of action without more.
Also we feel curious by knowing how would remain the scenes inserted, where the main personage descends of the car and he walks for his own foot.
As it is used to happening in the series of NFS, the results do not vary much with respect to what we expected us.
There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in the total computation points on account of absurd failures are lost, that already come appearing in the series since years ago.
In reality not itself neither to call errors, but rather, it is a matter of the incomprehensible reluctance of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
It is introduced you in a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to resolve them, him is offered to participate in an illegal career for every America.
You sit down to the steering wheel in the western coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive the first to New York.
The idea is to offer somewhat interesting.
The route is divided into ten phases and, then, in more than fifty careers.
Of it it is deduced that each career considers place a different route and the phases are located in different environments, that turn out to be quite diverse and interesting.
That way, one does not have neither vaguely the sensation that the play offer always the same thing.
Some of the environments they turn out to be even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, is not swum of the other world.
But the walk by the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Besides, the careers are diversified occasionally by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find you a sandstorm that diminishes the visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains one must be careful so that you not an avalanche bury.
According to that, each one of the careers is very well developed.
Alone there is a pair of models, but with that suffices.
During a moment, you try to be in advance of a quantity of rival required (the normal thing in a classical career), later try to win time (classical sorrow timed) and then a sorrow against a single adversary expects you.
In the middle of all this the police appears at times, that does not do but to complicate still more the things.
The news are the landscapes out of the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, should escape from someone and you have to help it, always pressing the at the moment just just button.
Complicated nothing.
It turns out to be surprising, nevertheless, that have enough less landscapes in the play of what goatish to expect (in concrete there is alone three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not come be uncomfortable and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that do that the play turn out to be more interesting.
The model of conduction continues the tracks of the previous episodes.
That means that to day of today no longer be much, but itself cannot be affirmed that be evil.
If you seek a realistic simulation, already can seek in another part.
But to a career conceived with plenty of action agrees the enough this style of conduction, although we will be able to find somewhat better among the play of the competence.
To here, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
As opposed to the correct thing of the models of conduction, no longer the same thing with the collisions occurs.
Of play of this type it is not possible to expect that amuse deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not all is in order.
It is typical that, upon doing a very adjusted progress or to circulate the car with a so alone, normal traffic there be light close contacts, but in other almost identical situations, your car finishes doing pirouettes descontroladas.
Or even it finishes completely destroyed.
Thanks to the system of reseteo, not large problems arise, but can put you in a bad mood.
The reseteos are planned in such a way that, when you have an accident or leave the trail, the play returns you to the last point of rescue in the trail.
Nevertheless, in each alone career has five reseteos available.
If you consume them all, have to resume the career since the principle.
Thus therefore is not more than an aid in the event that something go not well, but is not very to give credit.
At times, neither the reseteo helps, alone aid the to be learned the phase given by memory.
A great disadvantage of the play is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one must enter of a specific way; of another way, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find you in some place vehicles "civil" always with the same configuration, although be the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or later.
This does of rabiar above all in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the encounter in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when arrive, should rotate or well to brake.
It is equal when arrive, because is planned because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The adversaries have besides an advantage more.
During all the departure you will arrive at places where, without keep in mind the moment, always the same adversary in the same place will advance you.
Besides this occurs in the end of the departure, in a long bridge, which results still more shocking.
Your opponent should arrive before that you, to the price that be.
When it goes in front of you, the vision of the cars complicates you that come forward, so at the beginning you can do baby food the car.
The idea to create he can be understood a play with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you immediately.
And is a grief, because although the model of the trip be simple, the play is amused and with action, so that often is not possible to continue to the detail what happens neither where.
And really it gives equal, if the merit is carried the idea with fifty exclusive trails or the classification in the career so that fit not the boredom, or any another thing.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the careers.
You have to be attentive to the gas pumps next to the highway, because exactly there have to change of car, although in the great majority of the cases will suffice you what have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are adequate for urban zones, the self-strong American for the straight freeways and the exotic superdeportivos for a technical conduction, for example, by highways of mountain with curves.
Besides main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is to say, there are careers in concrete places that you will know for the histories.
Here you will obtain not alone medals, but also points of experience for your profile, that serves so much for the challenges as the stories.
Upon reaching the upper level, the conductor are opened him several possibilities, beginning for the car and to putting an end to funds for the profile.
At the same time, to have connected a function Autolog in line, that compares your results with the of other players and disponibiliza other common functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how is done the last career in the history.
With the car you arrive to the tunnel of the meter (even), where begin to run in the dark by the ways (even).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (even) and, suddenly, from behind the convoy of the meter arrives you and is carried you in front without more.
In the editing surely we will have a discussion on this during several days, on if during the programming of the not a single play thought even a little or if the authors truly take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the play is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in pleasant most cases, at times to proud.
Therefore what a pity that, in the most tense moments the quality of image is reduced and, from time to time, of a serious way.
This affects above all to the accidents where to have involved many participants, when the quality of continuous image no longer is valid.
The audio is well and the soundtrack is a question of inclinations.
In order to that be of the I please to most of the youthful group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of its father and of its mother", but can be supposed that nobody would buy the alone play by its music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the play avoided absolutely foolish errors, we would have problems in affirming that The Run is the best play of NFS of recent years.
It gives the sensation that the play be not concluded.
The diversion is insured, but you prepare you because the errors will strike you in the eyes with the force of some reflectors of airport.

The ambassador before the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativistas and Eurosceptic.
"The they tried Lisbon has affected significantly to the equilibrium among the individual institutions"
"Did not he expect me that an all-out war was mounted".
"It will last five, six years, before the situation be stabilized a little, calm and the new players be accustomed to its new roles", thus began with conviction its conference in the Faculty of Right the Czech ambassador before the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How be not taken in serious its motto "clear and openly on Europe", that said already in the first part of its conference, when each organ of the EU he managed to describe and its relations with such precision and clarity, therefore would be the envy of many conferenciantes of the Faculty of Right of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also praised the work from of the new permanent president of the European Counsel, Herman go Rompuy:
"The first thing the criticisms arise, that if is insipid, a capable, gray official to assume any role, but I should to say that left all disconcerted, because assumes its roles to the perfection".
"It is a man that knows to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, to be communicated with them and that he has a very clear vision from where should go the EU".
The new position of representative of the foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: "¿Who is this EU? Why number I can call it?". Treats therefore of an important step toward the unification and the clarification from of the political union with a view toward States as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit us the cheese of Olomouc
Vicenová has been occupied also of the agenda continued, continues and will continue the European Counsel in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs were in charge of the emerging economic crisis, they resolved the crisis of the gas and they organized a summit for the Oriental Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified like a very negative aspect, that affected seriously to Chequia.
The Czech representation in the EU considers the moment many commitments.
In words of the ambassador: "A good disturbance", not alone the presidency, but also the financial crisis, that is treating now.
On the other hand, one must approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current a lot more complicated, economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and effective, ¿what sectors will take precedence, what countries will receive greater support and which less? That is something that been present in the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador recalled also his main mottoes, with the ones that he arrived at Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The certain thing is that i do not they like the ugly abbreviations, the foreign expressions or the slangs that the people does not understand".
"¿How does it be able a citizen to understand that in Brussels not the cucumbers are invented truly the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of diverse sizes or that nobody is going to prohibit us the cheese of Olomouc?".
Also it intends to remove more benefit of the environment of the EU and to approach more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
The Europe of the velocities expects us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have fame of Eurosceptics and the people perceives more well the negative aspects that the positive.
Besides, regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is of multitude of factors, like the modesty of our candidates, her incapacity to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czechs.
Besides the success of the Czech presidency, put of relief the force and the contribution of the Group of Visegrad.
"Créanme that when they respond to me a Pole and a Hungarian and itself me about a Slovak, a French beside me tells me: “¿Qué, already you have remained, the of the Group of Visegrad?", and is seen that him not any grace does".
In the future, to the EU, according to Vicenová, new very hard regulations of budget policies for the member States they await him.
It is perceived like something very real of the concept of the two velocities, if they are not more, in Europe, more than the new one of "the European Confederacy".
"We have countries in the euro Zone and countries out of the euro Zone".
"We have the space Schengen and we have besides the procedure of cooperation reinforced".
"It was told for the first time that alone they cooperate the countries that quieran and the not, that remain was".
"These procedures will be each time more and they will reinforce the Europe of the two velocities", expects Vicenová.
In this sense, also emphasized the role of Chequia and of Herman they go Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the themes that affect to the totality of the EU should debate among the not alone, member states among the members of the euro Zone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM initiates its second century of existence
If someone sought a term that to define with great precision the strategy of IBM, the most approximate one he would be "long time limit".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a business that is perceived like current and, nevertheless, already they have elapsed a hundred years since their foundation.
The base of this character largoplacista put it the first leader of the firm, the visionary one Thomas J. Watson Mr.
Already he minted the motto that many problems of the world have solution if the people is willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its seal, around which will go building the life of the gigantic future (was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was besides the base of a culture of business carefully raised.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement in direction to the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years by that reason, because was maintained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing to the changes around.
That has permitted us, during our first century, to transform the technology, the business and the company.
We expect to prosper still more in our second century", affirmed during its anniversary, the current director of the business Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the years 30, worried of the care of their employees as the businessman of in Chequia (the employees of IBM were of the first American operatives that enjoyed sure, full holidays, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewarded the better inventors and salespersons.
The same long-term sophistication maintains it IBM in the relation with the client.
Already since the principle the business knew to discover talents (upon being one of the first world businesses in put an end to any type of discrimination, could elect without problems).
In the line of the strategy antidiscriminación is the current plan of IBM, by the one that to Palmisano a woman will substitute her next year: Virginia Rometty.
She already carries working thirty years in IBM, where he has been a sales manager, marketing and strategies.
During the last years IBM has participated of the calls virtual encounters, rain of ideas in line, of the one that arise infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not to surprise that exceed ideas, therefore in the firm they work almost half million of people.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides to the company a strong external and internal image.
"Since the principle, IBM maintained a concept of institution more than of technological business", affirms the economist teacher of the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological business, but a business that tries to resolve problems of business for users of the technology", states George Colony of the consulting one Forrester Research.
As the own business says exists a difference among entering the business and to create directly a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it he is known in the United States family on account of his logo, he has become the last a hundred years in one of the greater businesses of the world.
Is possibly the most versatile technological business (develops as much teams as programs, infrastructures and web lodging services inside an extensive range of services, that go from servants to nanotechnology).
It shows off the major number of patents of all the American technological businesses and five of its employees have received the Nobel prize.
Among their inventions they are found the ATM, the cards of payment, the financial exchanges, the bar codes and the disquetes.
IBM will invoice this year 220 thousand million dollars. This year has become the second signs technological by capitalization of market (the first one is Apple), when surpassed for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking at to the future
Not all the products and innovations have just satisfied the flavor of the clients and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, YOU/2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).
"If its business is based on advancing, cannot be anchored emotionally in the past", recognized Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM does not have problems in building its bases in other platforms (and likewise, if do not they function, abandons them).
And it the difference of the competence, Microsoft, that basically is maintained and falls always exclusively with Windows.
Technology of future
In question of sales, IBM is dedicated above all to services, of the ones that approximately a fifth part they are of programs and another fifth one of teams.
With all, still in 1990 the teams they represented more than the half of the quota of the suppliers.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold assets of low performance by a total value of 15 thousand million dollars. During in the same period, has invested 58 thousand million dollars in the future technology purchase.
The investments have followed since 2008, when for the first time the modern world financial crisis was declared.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first leader, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29 enlarged the investments.
It seems that up to now the business IBM has known to escape the crisis.
The value of the actions of IBM since the start of the year 2008 has grown stratospherically to a 120%, the net profit of the business has not left to enlarge.
The currency of IBM is to change it all, save its value.
It is able, therefore, to expect that when come the following crisis, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: since the cutter of cheeses to the spatial flights
The business IBM (International Business Machines) was based on New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is adopted already in the year 1924 - originally was a matter of a mark utilized in the branch offices of Canada and South America.
The base that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises of the fusion of four businesses that went back to the decade of 1880.
It possessed inventions as the famous one "timeclock", that permits to control the entrance and exit of the employees.
The architect of the new business was the businessman Chat Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also he presided his counsel supervisor.
Flint put on file the leader of a business of the competence, Thomas J. Watson, so that helped it with the management of the business.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson continue being the firm base on the one that are supported the culture and corporate identity).
Watson directed the business to the year 1952.
IBM, just as indicates its name, began with the production and sale of all kinds of apparatuses for business, from cutters of meat and cheese to boxes cash registers.
During the four first years that Watson directed the business, the billing was duplicated in 9 million dollars and began the great expansion of the business by the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the business that, almost after forty years occupying the chair of the leader, was substituted by its son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began to work in the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the years 60 the personnel and the computers of IBM helped the NASA to guide the flights to the space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.
The classics "pecés", that established the standard of computers of that time, they arrived at the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese business Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the part of consultancy of the business Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and services of highly value added.
The strategy that has paid IBM these three last years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is to say, "a more intelligent planet".
Its objective is to do a rationaler use of the technology, although not yet the areas have been planned neither has improved the circumstances, for example, in the relating to the transportation and the administration of cities.
For the sector of the commerce, IBM presented does not do a lot of the platform "Smart Commerce" that permits the retailers to negotiate the complete commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch office in the Czechoslovakia of then, the first country that had it in the Europe Central and Oriental.
Today here, the IBM operates besides the strategic center of outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Europe Central and Oriental has he is in Prague. Also here there is a world fame investigation team that works with the recognition of voice.
About its unfaithful husband:
Vat, you remain you to that donkey, that no longer I want it!
Darina (53) he said ¡he was finished!
After its husband Josef (53) had become the unique protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also its lover, Darina he continued having the hope that Josef awoke of its dream rose and would return home.
Nevertheless already it is not going to expect and has established clear rules for the life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer as my couple", explained.
When Darina received during the summer to Bartošové in its house, did not be able neither to be imagined how would finish its marriage.
In spite of the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
Until it declared publicly that loved it.
With time, Darina was resigned, apparently accepted the relation of its husband and even said goodbye to him for always.
To does not it import her with who goes to bed its woman.
If a day to break with Bartošová, its woman would not expect her at home with the open arms.
It is the biological father of my children and, if the remainder of its life in our house wants to live, nobody will throw him".
"But here he would live not already as my darling and old donkey that was mistaken, but like a man to which certain ties they unite me", he said and he added that already he had been unhitched of his husband and he insisted only in the mutual respect.
To Josef up to now her does not import that herself woman have her closed the back door.
"I accept the decision of my wife".
"I will be with Iveta and there is not possible change".
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I her respect".
"The business continues in vigor, I do the arrangements of house, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases".
"Darina and I we speak us with normality, the unique thing is that we do not share bed, he said.
If he found a new love, he he would not be opposed.
"Do not we sleep together and she does not interest me, neither where does he go neither if he has some boyfriend.
Already I know that is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I assume all the responsibility", concludes Josef.
The worst vices of the women: Also they refer you?
If you ask the men that be capable of citing some typical vices of the women, in general each one of them will name them without thinking.
Beloved women, ¿you recognize you in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to cause to boil the blood to the males?
Going shopping
It reproaches to its orange average that has dependence of the purchases?
It has to be bought at least a get-up in week?
He likes to buy from change in the discounts?
Then in its case can be told that to go shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that should appease their passion by the purchases, at least a little.
But to see, ¿what woman would be able to resist the temptation to stroll without more by the stores of clothes, to seek well adjusted tokens and later to test them to him all in the changing room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for the majority of the women to go shopping is a hobby, for the men can be converted practically in a hell.
Alone it recall how many times already has said to its couple that better expect it in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"¿I am not too fat?"
"It would need to make thin at least five kilograms - ¿should begin to do exercise?"
"¿Truly you flavor?"
Him not these phrases they sound?
To that yes?
Then it is one of those women obsessed by its aspect.
It is not that you owe to stop taking care of, but many men are allergic to listen to their couple to be complained all the time of their physical aspect.
The strong sex also agrees that the more enlarges the frequency of the complaints, more bother you return the women.
The order and the cleaning in the first place
Is like an infinite carousel.
Cleaning the windows, to pass the vacuum, to scrub the floor, to remove the dust, to scrub the bathtub and all that at least two times for week.
It reproaches to its couple that have stepped the clean floor with a dirty foot, to its children that have dirtied a washroom recently cleaned and a bookcase with doors of glass that so much cost him to clean?
In the event that you suffer this "deviation", test to be conscious that nothing should be exaggerated and that the order and the cleaning surely should not occupy to be fundamental in the family.
This inoffensive desire of cleaning would be able to threaten its relations and the family welfare.
Commenting unpleasant
"The shorts used are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to put you also tomorrow those socks used"
"¡The cloth wet is not left on the ground!"
If it does those cometarios to its couple more times to the day, know that thus will manage to remove it of its booths.
Naturally. You does not mean anything bad, alone wants to obtain that all be in order.
Perhaps, if the men knew this, the women, in turn, would not do so many comments.
You slander and gossips
To some women go them also the slanders, the gossips, but also the offenses and the conspiracy against someone.
The women concentrate on the relations, therefore he likes to speak meetings of things of the type who, where, with who, how and why.
Maybe to each one of we at times escapes him itself a small and inoffensive gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is own of almost all the women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those that themselves they are not controlled, to the ones that charms to gossip and they do it often, they despise to all and they turn out to be dangerous for the ones that they surround them, above all in a female labor team.
Jágr and they helped with their assistances to conquer to the Philadelphia
The forward one of hockey Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the encounter of NHL with two assistances that brought the victory on the Philadelphia 5:3 in the court of Carolina and puts again the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the move of the star of 39 years, and took a step more and was declared better player of the party.
It was judged two assistances in the party and also the companion of Jágr, Jakub.
After the encounter, Jágr affirmed before the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Already before the party had said him that would do triplete".
"It felt it".
"At times ambushes seem", explained Jágr, after its action gave a goal to Giroux, because of the first shot of the Flyers.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trace.
It was done with the disk behind the entrance of the Hurricanes and moved it among the circles to Maxim Talbot, that put goal.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the principle of the second part already they dominated the Flyers.
Concretely by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr put the third goal, after its shot was strained for the room of the entrance of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him".
"Do not I mean that be the best player of the court, but without doubt is among the three better", praised Jágr to its head office.
"Never itself me would have occurred that in the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman as he".
"I am very satisfied of it".
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results", adds Jágr.
Carolina still converted the party in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and after new of Dwyer, of penalty, to being put to a goal of distance.
Matt Read did not permit more complications, although they finished surpassed in number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good action in our field".
"It cleared the disk, I took velocity and Read went toward the most far away part".
"I tried to get it right to the disk and I am happy because I obtained it", described the last goal of the party just as lived it.
With its victory, Philadelphia has itself placed in head of the Conference This.
The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav did not he play to the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew for a wound in the upper part of the body.
The Canadiens not alone lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec did not know to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the great quantity of injured in the last row, and to play the alone party with five defenses.
"That is evil".
"We play the alone party with a veteran player, the remainder they were new".
"In short, but it is that against that nothing can be done, we have to fight with it", he said Jacques Martin.
"So much to rotate to the players returned against us, him we could not resist".
"We had to simplify more still the play, to remove the disk of our field".
"And thus we leave holes", explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
The goalkeeper Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the matted Hair Bay.
The goals of Jets were marked by five players that put thus end to a series of routs that already five parties lasted.
How have they evolved the prices of the trips since 1989
Until 1989 there were in the Czechoslovakia of then alone five authorized state travel agencies: Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that moment sold in most cases travel alone to the socialist block, therefore the trips to West were very restricted.
The Czech tourists went, therefore, of holidays to the beaches of the REV (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period understood between 1962 and 1972, when could travel to Yugoslavia, nevertheless, later the Yugoslavian state inclined toward the west and the trips of the Czech tourists were then enough restricted.
A great paradox of the socialism was the fact that to the citizens of the socialist block (that is to say, also to the Checoeslovacos) be not to permitted them to travel free and individually not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
The travel agencies offered in those times also travel to the West, but one should be put to the queue with a bag to sleep and to pass thus all the night, or to have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Even so not all was earned.
The call "promise of change" that was the condition for the trips to the West, itself was not granted to the "reliable politically little people", that thus could not travel at all.
The czechoslovakian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, unsecured of change, was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to West.
The great majority of the Czechs they passed their holidays in their own country, for which there was a great number of cabins and summer homes, that the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way to travel from the Czechs has suffered since 1989 an authentic revolution.
While until 1989 for us was the does not go more to spend the holiday in the REV or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs did 4.5 million trips of holidays to countries of the entire world.
It results nna great paradox, of the one that nowadays no longer we are conscious, the fact that to the at present favorite destiny, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel itself freely, because formed part of the Yugoslavia of then.
At the beginning of the years 90 the exemption of visas was imposed to travel to the neighboring States of Europe western, what caused an enormous wave of visits of short term, above all to Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, for a long time, himself not enough of the excursions to the West were seen, everyone he wanted to see the him less for a moment.
For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs in the parks in tents slept, since our incomes of then us did not permit to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was it to be carried with himself the food (preserves, stuffed, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, thus our tourists were able finally, after decades, to buy freely western currency.
Our standard of living enlarged and with him also the salaries media, what around 1997 caused an increase in the demand of trips.
With the increase of the demand of trips they began the agencies, from 1997 with regularity, to prepare the trips using the connections of charter flights, what caused descended incredibly the prices of the trips in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
To ends from the 90 of last century, already the Czechs travelled without visa to almost all the countries developed, except United States, which simplified still more our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of the pursuit-revolutionary tourism happened already in the 2000, when was organized, thanks to an enormous demand, the first flight direct from Chequia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, leave every year direct charter flights with Czech tourists did warm and distant countries. This winter already will fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinies.
The exotic countries visit them at present near 100 thousand Czechs to the year.
Another interesting moment of this epoch, that symbolizes our pursuit-revolutionary development, arrived in the year 2008.
November 17, 2008, United States eliminated the visas for the Czech tourists, with what our country passed to be among the most developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, they have passed more than the half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in their history, they have been spent in trips abroad more than 15 thousand Czech crowns by head, including the expenses in the place of stay.
It called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, that would be able to have just new in break-even point.
Since almost five months ago the Czech soccer is without president and is probable that the successor of Ivan Hasšek as the President of the Czech Confederacy of Soccer will not be known neither after the assembly of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, not yet has arrived at an agreement on the rules of voting to continue.
Without the same, itself it will not be able to vote even to elect among the three candidates.
Them they interested to preside the Czech soccer they are Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
It hasšek renounced its charge in June not without before call its colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person that knew to be in charge of the soccer in the future.
Nevertheless, after concluding was Has itšek, a controversy between the two confederacies of the incapable association was untied of arriving at an agreement to choose a common candidate.
It remained in evidence September 16 when had to be chosen the new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní situated in the neighborhood praguense of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not alone as for the method of election.
Itself arrived at no consensus neither as for who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment and due to this only point, a partial agreement was produced, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Right, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible.
Nevertheless, the disputes on the electoral code continue open.
More light on the situation no longer could throw neither the executive board that, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility to vote has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point continues being the same one.
The question is the following one: Of what way to proceed in the third round to avoid the break-even point?
"The dispute revolves around if should proceed according to the statutes or to find another model", says Dušthey go Svoboda, one of the three vice president of the one that, since the direction of the association, represents the professional soccer.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win that candidate that have greater percentage of support in the confederacy to which will present its candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is willing to arrive at a commitment so that can win that candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both confederacies.
Bohemia splits it, nevertheless, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should to have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would remove him, nevertheless, the sense at two o'clock you patrol previous and would deny completely the concept of bicameral system", thus is like Svoboda understands the objections of it splits morava, according to which the best would be not to touch the order and to vote according to the applicable statutes.
With it they said, surprisingly, agrees also Takesš Paclík, although is supposed that the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all the candidates agrees more to Pelta.
"I would like that voted to the maximum according to the statutes".
"So that himself they be not invented any foolishness about the representatives as in the last General Assembly", the owner of Victory says Plzen, that is advanced for the first time like the candidate and that he directs his observations chiefly against Pelta.
Pelta continues being an optimist.
According to him, in Nymburk will be decided on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future cooperated in a constructive way.
"All the passions will be appeased with the party of today of our national team in the European Championship.
"The soccer will be again protagonist, and thus he cooperated more to flavor" he affirms the representative of the Jablonice, that of the three candidates has more experience in management of the soccer, so much to professional as regional level.
Rajchl is the most reluctant one.
"I expect that arrive at an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is a lot more complicated."
"Does not it be a matter of the conflict between bohemians and moravos, but there are intents to adjust the rules to its own convenience."
"This can have as consequence a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"At any rate, I expect that the common sense will be imposed", said Rajchl.
No longer remains a lot of time so that all the parts arrive at an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be carried out in Montenegro, but ¿who can know until he harms the party if the team of soccer will be complete?
The special airplane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice president Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, not this morning by technical problems in Prague has left, having that to be sought an alternative to transport to part of the executive board to the place where will take place the party of classification.
Quizas the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place to ministerial level, that, they as count, this Wednesday will be celebrated.
To Josef Dobeš, minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like a lot to incorporate to the parts divided to the most powerful sports organization of the country so that arrive at an agreement.
There is a lot in play: the state subsidies, the credibility of the soccer and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the czechoslovakian confederacy of the sport that will try to endow of a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of lotteries Sazka.
Paclík will fight for reaching the presidency, because does not find a more adequate candidate.
If the leader of the footballers of Beer, Takesš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly to know the name of an adequate candidate that satisficiese all its ideas on the new president of the Czech Confederacy of Soccer neither would be presented like the candidate to a so prominent position.
"If there it was an adequate person, would be fighting for her and me would not present as the candidate to the elections."
"But to the day of today himself not a person has been able to be found thus", he said Paclík for the Agency of Czech News
What motivates to Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility to block to Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, that opens the road to the presidency of the Czech Confederacy of Soccer.
Paclík also states that, in case to conquer, would remain in the charge of alone president until 2013, when the shift of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that charge he would like to see an expert and good manager that be not too much related to the soccer events.
"Already I have spoken with some people to the ones that would be able to keep in mind".
"For it was an insanity to hear to some to say that at this time not even they desire to be identified with the Czech soccer."
"I would like to change that vision", adds.
What supposedly more I bother to Paclík at this time is the relation of Pelta with the President of the Association of Regional Soccer of Beer Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, acquaintance out of the world as a powerful one lobista with capacity to influence in the voting of the delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík is so unacceptable to see Pelta seated in the presidential chair.
"In the event that win, the status would be maintained in force and nothing in the soccer will change".
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, the soccer will remove still less benefit", said Paclík.
It mentions also the fact that some years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a listens telephone during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta left unpunished.
"Do not I know what prestige to the soccer would be able to bring the victory of Pelta."
"And with what eyes the UEFA will look at us and the FIFA", said Paclík, that also takes with certain precaution its previous statement that "would sell the Club Beer if Pelta become president".
In the case to win the elections on Thursday, Paclík would be able to be presented the cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, that has been supported for Paclík before the General Assembly of September that finished in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one to which he would continue".
"Is very capable."
"Would be able it me to imagine, for example, like the leader of the representation".
"But not as the manager of an association".
"I do neither put the noses there where me do not I feel capable", added Paclík, that in September stirred up a lot of attention by supporting the suspension of the Commission of Referees presided by Ludek Macel, substituted later by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that would dare to negotiate the association.
It resorts to his capacities of management of the private enterprises, therefore since last summer is also the Director of the Beer, that with his support he celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have force to change some things in the environment of soccer and to contribute to its sure practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, that probably tend to influence in the decisions of the disciplinary committee and of appeal, producing unpleasant situations, he said Paclík without hide his dislikes toward the president of the Sparta Daniel.
One of the priorities would also be that of consolidating the relation between the and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the aid of which exercised pressure on the political leaders so that they destine more money to the sport of the taxes of the lottery.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If they enlarged the taxes on the games of chance, as the political parties announce it, would support its arguments, but, frankly, they have that to tell us where is going to stop all this money", indicates.
Ademas, Paclík now does not keep in mind even its association with the Club Pilsner, although he himself affirms that the President of it should be "not partisan".
Pelta is at the same time associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"Is not ideal."
"But I do not see sense to the fact to yield hipócritamente my actions of the Club of Beer to another person in order then to return there after a year and a half", he said Paclík.
Pelta promised to the new statutes that to would put an end to the break-even point of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Soccer one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in case of to be elected, would guarantee that had it some new statutes that to serve finally to solve, in the future, the controversies as for the electoral regulation.
The representative of the Jablonec is an optimist as for the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and he believes that the pre-election conflict would be able to advance toward a solution today with the possible victory of the team of soccer.
Already before the elections done not carry out in September, Pelta promised to be centered, in case of to be elected, exactly in the representation and in collecting funds.
It decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, for which this postponement of two months would be able him to go well to defend and to present, in a more extensive context, its ideas on the management of the soccer.
"The people of all the levels is in charge of the soccer already a long time ago and wait to know this Thursday to the new President."
"They feel that the hour has arrived that someone negotiate the association", he thinks the man that associates chiefly with the Club of Jablonice, but that worked in the Sparta and in the executive board of the Association.
For that reason, he believes to have sufficient experience to negotiate the Czech soccer.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the elation that reigned in the epoch of Ivan Hasšek.
"Sadly, in the general Assembly of June they were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as all they thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already from September", notified Pelta.
Exactly the retraining of the most important document of the Civic Association was used like decoy to be won the delegates.
"If they choose me president, I will take it me as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in the event that this fail."
"It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist", he says Pelta.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to become with his opponents.
Already in the past had notified that was seen collaborating with Henry Rajchl, to which respects for his formation in Right, being conscious that his opponent would be besides its first vice president.
Already it carried a lot of time without attacking to Thomas Paclík who, contrary to Pelta, did not leave puppet with head.
"It carries more than one year in the world of soccer, and already has achieved some successes."
"Its attacks but were shameful and many people remained surprised by the electoral campaign."
"Therefore many of them doubt on its true character", its opposing one told Pelta, that continues being faithful to the statements announced already in September.
Its more powerful weapon is, according to him, its knowledge of the soccer, since the lowest competitions to the superiors.
This last one should be shop window of promotion of the soccer.
"Likewise, he would try to solve all the scandals that arose on account of the Bohemians as a result of the last year corruption scandal."
"Immediately later it would involve me in the negotiations with the public sector and the private one, to assure that there be sufficient money for all the soccer", the the candidate of 46 years said two months ago.
Subsequently also it promised that his appointment as the president of the soccer would not behave any personal modification of the staff.
"It would have that to know first the tasks of each employee", said being referred to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable agitation reigns.
In spite of the current disastrous settings that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, without doubt we will manage to surpass it.
"The soccer needs credibility, which will recover alone if at last has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in its career of representative, Pelta continues being an optimist.
Rajchl promises, that under its leadership, would begin it to work with desires.
If in the quarter General Assembly leaves chosen the current vice president Jindrich Rajchl as new president of the Association of many, Czech Soccer people would be shown surely resentful.
Rajchl promises that, in case of to be elected, would work itself hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and to do that the members of the executive board be responsible for each area of the soccer individually.
Also it compromises to resolve the case of the Bohemians, to improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, to obtain more money for the soccer and to continue with the work initiated by the previous president Ivan Hasšek.
"As the president, i would like to dedicate me completely to the soccer".
"Since the international contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection, passing for the professional soccer or the training of young footballers of highly performance."
"With this do not I mean that would do it all alone", said Rajchl in an interview for the.
"I am a player of team and I want to divide the competences of the executive board in such a way that each member can be dedicated to an area specifies."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that the soccer be able, in each one of those segments, to continue ahead with a lot of impulse".
"To many people this probably he will not like, because will signify to begin to work very hard and not only to criticize the work of the others", added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the soccer movement, he is said that he has considered the possibility of be not presented again as the candidate.
"All they know, that I work 20 daily hours."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will not be people behind my that will impede me and will hinder at every step", explained thus the motives of its indecision.
"Many people has said me that I should not give up, because then they would give up also the others".
"It is a matter of having faith for abandon not thus, without more", said.
They as say, motivates him also to continue the work that already began with Hasšek.
"During those two years, a great part of the work was finished that do not want that now be lost".
"Processes exist that had begun and that will have its effect inside a pair of years and i would not like that someone stop them", he announced worried by the circumstance of that, if to choose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again just as was before the epoch of Hasšek.
"I believe in the order, and is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not capable of maintaining.
"Behind him is above all all that people that would be in charge of the soccer so that was alone a privilege for a few chosen."
"It can be reproached me a pile of things, but not the fact that I am in favor of someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to do a soccer for all, because alone thus they will feel well all and not alone the chosen", he said Rajchl.
It rejects also the idea that alone serious bohemian the president.
"Although some people try to affirm the contrary thing, I have in mind to do it maximum by Moravia."
"For example, is hour to think about the fact to divide the second division in a Czech part and in another morava, whose winners would go to the first division".
"Not the current situation would be given in which we have alone three teams of Moravia, what represents a problem for the players moravos young", said Rajchl.
Although to the fight of the presidential elections added Takesš Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl not to stops believing in its possibilities of to be elected.
"Still I feel to have a strong support of the Czech Confederacy, which chose me as their vice president and that knows that behind me there are clear successes", said Rajchl, whose successes understand the savings of some scores of millions of crowns of unfavorable contracts, the negotiations of television contracts and the negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, recognizes its part of fault in which the confederacy be not united.
And while it proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to recover the confidence in the Czech soccer", considers to the other rival one, Paclík, as a strong candidate that yes has something that to offer to the soccer.
"Nobody can deny that did a great work by the Beer that year".
"In the case that be chosen, probably will continue what already began Ivan Hasšek and not foreign exchange in a significant way the staff of the personnel in the committees."
"Do not I want to use that to my favor", evaluates thus to its rival Rajchl.
The prettiest pools of Europe
Leap to the blue one
by Julia Stanek
Pools since a viewpoint incredible, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Who visit Europe can live its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, to rest its tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where is found the best welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder carried out a trip of investigation during last year and a half, there was something that could not lack in its luggage, a bather.
It fallen of backs on the water, looked at the artistic dome in the high thing, swam toward the angelotes of marble, that expected it in the edge of the pool and was amazed before the modernist indoor swimming pool restored meticulously.
It liked the bath, took note in its notebook to the moment of all the interesting details on the style and the history of the building.
The historiadora architectural Meder explored more than 200 pools in this manner and presents them in its recent book "Badefreuden" : the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bath in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
It carried out its "trip through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" for 13 countries: Besides Germany, Austria and Swiss, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This German of 46 years is a true enthusiast of the culture of the bath.
It wants to have nothing to do with the sport, says Meder, alone the water is different.
Alone I bother that the fans to the bath have that to be comply with blue tiles and stench to chlorine, while the fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of the forests of firs or to listen the happy trills of the birds in the park.
"A day I asked me why the pools have to be always so ugly", affirms this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I began to collect pretty pools."
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of welfare in the pools is so large because all the are attended senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder endeavors, the indoor swimming pools can be a true gift for the view: "Instead of floor, in the baths has a surface of water."
"By a part is transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of all the building."
All doubles optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colors, the springboards.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and the art history in the historic oasis of the welfare, but, chiefly, gives desires to jump to the blue one.
Meder, the collector of pools discovers the noticeable copies in his investigations in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath of Széchenyi of Budapest, of 100 years, the water with nitrates in a singular cavity are found kárstica (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some termas, whose pools are of alkaline water and they are found in a building with form of bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many discovered pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city puts the eyes in the pool roofed of Zurich, can look at to Arlberb, covered with snow, since the exterior pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window since the one that the practice in the trails can be observed of ski.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary wait to the clients in Längenfeld: The cathedral of the water of Ötztal seems a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
Of three open sources vapor in winter rises, while of fund the mountains of Ötztal are raised in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
To Meder, the collector of pools, him did not invade the smell to chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague to diesel oil is so strong that the people believes to have arrived at a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal water that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose mud is hit to the skin upon entering the pool, an enjoyment of the in a way special welfare.
Iris Meder also was disappointed in a place in its search of pretty places for the bath, when wanted to visit discovered pools and baths of sun in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, was found with a land blocked.
The bath from 1902 of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked at through them decayed windows of the yellow white, red, and modernist building, saw the weeds to grow among the tiles.
The decadence counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction after of itself; not alone can be discovered elements neorománicos of times of their construction in 1844, if not also an Arabian foyer of style Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the collector of pools, Iris Meder, and not alone because be natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to fuse different architectural styles in a so fantastic unit", affirms Meder.
In a palace thus the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have a lot of importance.
Agrarian speculation
The Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of the commodities
By Christian Teevs
Resigns the Deutsche Bank to its business with agricultural commodities?
According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has entrusted a working party to verify the consequences of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the leader of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, at 84 percent of the Germans does not seem them acceptable that the banks speculate with the agricultural commodities as the wheat or the corn.
Two thirds of the polled claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw of this business because intensifies the problems of the poorest of the world.
This is the result of a survey by assignment of the organization of consumers Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch to the middle of October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the markets of global commodities cause rise the prices, and the banks charge with the responsibility of the world problem of the hunger.
The campaign of the defender of the consumer is directed in concrete to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although the large banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act of way seemed.
Originally, the bets on commodities thought to protect the merchants of the oscillations of the prices.
The main experts agree that the players have been disconnected of the supply and demand, and remove profits of the prices of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted before the criticisms of different form that the American competitors: It promised to revise the demands and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good fame of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working party is revising the demands of the report of Foodwatch.
The analysis should be finalized to ends of year, then the results to the board of directors of the Deutsche will be presented Bank, along with the recommendation of how handle the matter.
To ends of January, the direction of the bank will report of the consequences.
In the end would be able to be given a reduction of the business of the commodities, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix its image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed its criticisms to the financial sector: "The bets to growing prices of food show of especially drastic way how the merciless banks damage at present the public welfare."
Ackermann he is found like the major banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank should annul all the investments of its accounts receivable in which put in play the money for bets of eating prices", affirmed Bode.
"It gives equal if Ackermann treats the theme of the people that passes hunger or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann turns out to be surprising at first sight, but is of course the leader of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his position.
Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the president of the board of directors will change somewhat different to him done not plan in the board meeting.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation can perfect its image.
And it needs that barely possible losses they import him, of that its successor will be occupied.
Two thirds would annul the investment in commodities
Foodwatch endeavors in maintaining high the pressure on the manager.
Up to now, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the campaign of the organization.
Tuesday, Bode published the survey for the one that the Institute Forsa had asked 1,001 people the 7 and 8 of November.
Barely the 10 percent considered legitimate that the Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which the prices of the food were wagered.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences upon discovering that its bank participated in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would annul all the investments of the ones that money of the agrarian speculation leaves.
The 43 percent would dissuade a bank thus to its acquaintances, the 49 percent would request, after reflecting, to annul its account and would change to another institute.
The house 21 in Vienna
The building transferred
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy end, the building of the Austrian World's Fair of Brussels of 1958 obtained prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and decayed.
Now reopens as house of expositions.
The architecture of postgerra modern impassions, the clear forms, the halls of crystal, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of the thought on the technical progress, for what, the Austrian building of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the World's Fair of Brussels of 1958 is a known and adequate example.
The Building of Schwanzer obtained then the Grand Prix of Architecture by its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is considered to the present time a contemporary milestone of the architecture.
It did the so known architect that also built the building of Austria in the following World's Fair.
With its legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW more the adjacent building leveled in Munich, passed to internationally to be known.
Its building, designed as a temporary construction for expositions raised itself after the World's Fair in the Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the century was inaugurated 20, was called the "house 20".
The building was adapted but lacked the spaces and adequate technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, neither a good environment.
In spite of it was utilized until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and each time decays more.
At present, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the building, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday afternoon the museum gazebo was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exposition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arch, the new director of the gallery Austrian gazebo since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-arch, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among others things, patinadora artistic on ice in its youth, later in Sotheby, the museum Guggenheim and director founder of the museum of modern art of Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.
Except for the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor are exposed Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation, there should be a café and a bookstore and besides to be built a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best election to do it.
Not alone because reformed in a sensitive way the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and him was judged the contest, if not because studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the building was for him an "important and immense place", in which contemplated "almost all weekends" the expositions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, that disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of utilization with generosity and facility.
In the current reforms there are large problems, the building was "a devouring one of energy", said Krischanitz.
It changed the profile of the windows of the facade of crystal, an insulating crystal was installed reinforced with fiberglass and the ceiling of crystal by a special safety glass was replaced.
The thermal bridges and the beams of steel were reinforced or they replaced and the ceilings of asbestos they were rehabilitated.
Two basements were employed for the new use, a board of light descended among the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter to the almost new building, but still the building of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old tones mahogany and protected against the oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as was before.
And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a reduction budget.
"Often it had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked to the monuments protection office", affirms Krischanitz and notifies of a rough floor in the basement.
In spite of all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building is maintained flexible and light.
That business about the building "that came of Brussels" has been difficult, affirmed does little Krischanitz, a typical one "coincidental apparition in the history of the city".
An architecture thus is "always in the wrong place" and therefore wanted "to awake the adequate conscience".
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has happened an urban development stroke of luck. The completely new one and planned "neighborhood of the central station", with dwellings and offices, is found next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps happen another stroke of luck: The house 21 would be able to receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, therefore the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary art of berlin and, as is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.

The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also it applies to Citigroup, that obliged a payment of 20.5 million dollars.

Warren Buffett contributes with 10 billion to IBM
The guru of the finances, Buffett, invests with force in the business of information technologies IBM.
From March has acquired shares by a value of more than ten thousand million dollars.
Up to now the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in businesses of computers neither information technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of the businesses are negatives.
But it has read the commercial report of IBM and changed its opinion on investing in the sector.
He should understand long before that IBM offers above all services and tries systems of computers for the departments of information technologies of other businesses.
In the financial world, an investment of Warren Buffett is considered like a honor.
Therefore, the primitive one of information technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett was watchful at present in the radio station of economy CNBC that has acquired shares of IBM by a value of 10.7 thousands of million dollars from March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway of investments has elevated with it to one of the greater shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent participation.
Buffett said that IBM knew up to now nothing of the commitment.
It praised to the direction that was in charge of the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They have done a genial work", affirmed Buffett on the strategy.
IBM established for some time the services of lucrative information technologies as the operation of computer centers.
The old data processing pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful teams for businesses.
Buffett avoided the businesses of technology to date.
He said that alone he invested in whose businesses business to understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant-maker or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway possesses near approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of all a series of large consortiums as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, old Münchener Rück.
Buffett, of 81 years, took charge of the small business textile Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and, with wise investments, expanded it to becoming one of the most valuable businesses of the world.
Nevertheless, its way of life is humble.
Therefore is an idol for innumerable investors of the entire world.
Its express train and infallible felt to win money has supplied him the nickname of "oracle of Omaha".
After discovering the investment of Buffett, the actions of IBM in market rose one percent.
"The blue giant", like he is known to IBM, he has a value in market of more than 220 thousand million dollars and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable businesses of technology of the world.
With Microsoft, affirmed Buffett, does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat itself concrete
After the discovery of "the cell of Zwickau", the Turkish mass media doubt of the German democracy.
A newspaper speech of a "bloody ideology" that be revived again.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and worry before this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin a ghost returns that dead was believed time ago, since the attacks with form of fires in Mölln in November of 1992 and in Solingen in May of 1993, not episodes of violence with background of far right against Turks had occurred more.
Nevertheless, never it has been questioned that in Germany exist xenofobia.
The network discovered extreme right-winger reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, neither much less, foreseeable.
"¿Be revived again the bloody ideology?", regular the edition by internet of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" stands out on the contrary that one of the authors of the crime was an informing one of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is shown worried about that the German authorities can be implied in the marshland extreme right-winger.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with sensibleness, the weekend recalled the victims of the racist violence with a wakefulness before the Door of Brandenburgo.
Two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin along with the German politicians and Turks reflected in a solemn act of the fifty anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The contact was put in scene with happy colors, like a history with happy end.
The information arrived at some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift by the fifty anniversary", the title of an article in the Turkish platform of internet says "there to Be X", being referred to the background of the chain of murders.
The German emission "Hürriyet" does neither insist on drawing this mental connection.
"It begins to smell badly", the title of the column says of Ahmet Külahci.
It stands out that them murdered were people that paid their taxes and they did an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the forums of internet of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not sought long before suspects in the circle of the far right.
Some it is shown as much as less rhetorical as for the drastic media: "From now on here is lost, to the immigrants does not remain them more than the self-defense and the armament".
"This will be the best autoprotección".
"The internal peace of Germany depends hardly of the quality of the explanation and of the adaptation of the sanction to all the network"., writes "Selen".
What signifies that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen they will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been engraved in the Turkish and German memories.
No another event showed more clearly the Turks that live here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that the distrust and the distance can flow into in the violence.
The attacks intensify the feeling of group of the Turkish part.
Repeat not the errors of the past
In the Turkish press the deficiency of the German politics after the attacks was criticized then chiefly, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack with form of fire of Solingen sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, its minister of Exterior Matters, substituted it in the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in their speech what contribute with the taxes the Turks of Germany.
It remains clearly how the value of a person according to the amount of its taxes is calculated.
The current information of the Turkish media shows again the deep thing that is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
Besides the effort of an extensive explanation and of a revaloración of the terrorism of far right in Germany, this time they cause lacks clear words.
The bank of the scandal of the lake of Zurich
The most it risked bank of Europe is not found in Italy neither France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost entered bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then slid of a crisis to the following one.
Now a German directs it.
Sure that Axel Weber had not thought it.
After his spectacular departure of the summit of the federal bank, in July he was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new one and almost likewise of spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is happy publicly, praises Switzerland by its beauty and to the UBS by its recently acquired solidity and drops kind observations on its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization".
"It is happy me to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
In September remained of course all would be completely different.
A financial user of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and he defrauded 1.7 billion euro.
Oswald Grübel, general director of the USB, a banker not alone acquaintance in Switzerland, had to respond.
The president of the administrative council of the USB was considered since then likewise touched, and all they asked: When arrives Axel Weber?
He was known that Weber should assess to the bank from February of 2012.
And it will take charge of the presidency of the administrative council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, like the bank communicated Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
Is not a banker, more well, professor of economy and counselor and he has had a period of surely necessary adaptation.
Of blow holds responsible itself of the strategy of a bank, that has just tested again that deserves the title "the major bank of the scandal of Europe" since time ago.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until does little was the major administrator of world goods, and on the other hand, since years ago, he slides of a scandal to the following one.
Nothing, thus seems it, him is saved to the long ago so proud Swiss bank.
Began the financial crisis.
The USB had an excellent fame until 2007.
The image of the administrator of discreet Swiss goods and solid, but also handy, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a great number in the investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB negotiates more money of wealthy clients that any another bank of the world.
And on the other hand, advanced as investment bank in the league of the large banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the old banker and subsequent professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, always I have qualified to the USB as model of a good bank."
"Since the current point of view, one is asked: How would it be able to mistake me?"
Was in a great error.
In the year 2007 left to the light that something left very badly in the USB.
In the middle of year, Peter Wuffli, general director, that up till then was considered as a very intelligent and genial banker, resigned surprisingly.
Some months later, the reason he suspected himself.
The investment fund of the bank embarked upon losses with high-risk titles and had to pay off thousands of millions.
To charge with this, the USB announced an injection of capital you're welcome less than of 13 billion Franks.
For this he found investors, naturally that some they looked at with contempt to a short time before: an Asian state fund and opaque of Singapore and a so discreet, Arabian state fund, that never its name had heard itself.
This was alone the first blow.
In April of 2008, got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second better paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October of 2008, continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many thousands of millions, the Swiss Confederation gave six thousands of millions of Franks by an obligatorily convertible bond, by means of the one that became joint-owner of the bank.
Every Switzerland was affected, the dramatic thing was affirmed that was this for a small country, if lodges to so large banks.
Finally the sum of the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more than five greater times that the economic results of Switzerland (to see graphic).
"We cannot rescue again to the UBS", Geiger, expert in banking said.
To the first catastrophe united the second.
Few months later, the UBS surrendered in a fiscal conflict with America and was shown willing to deliver the data of the wealthy clients, that possibly had defrauded taxes with aid of the bank.
Besides, it approves a figure of 780 thousands of million dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted benefits of these business with a compensation by payment.
With it, the UBS confessed more or less to have helped in the tax dodge.
Simultaneously it lost something that had been always its capital in the competence by rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank no longer is the same one.
To this continued the resignation of the president of the board of directors and of the president of the administrative council.
And the exodus of the funds of the clients.
In this manner, in few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the banking of investments by means of the erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods by means of the aid to the tax dodge.
And just when it was again something more tranquil, just when thought that the UBS to obtain it again, happens this unhappy history of the user, an individual user defrauded 1.7 billion euro, before the bank realized that something went badly.
And it was watchful, by it seen, this does not yet function well with the management of risk in the banking of investments.
"With the case Adoboli is declared that the controls of risk have changed too little", affirms Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finances in the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a great German bank also is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that does not dominate the controls of risk".
For which the idea of the precaution arose, with the one that the Swiss bankers were presented since time ago, to be the guardians of the greater goods of the world: no too large risk, on the other hand, the security of the money wants to break on the other side of the alpine republic.
The deposits of security of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unbreakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The head office of the UBS in Zurich does not insert with the cliché of the solid alone, Swiss private bank is a little greater.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters on the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, that goes since the main station directly to the lake of Zurich, framed by the summits covered with snow of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest of Europe.
Here jewelry stores are found like Tiffany`s among Swiss traditional business as the sweetshop Sprüngli.
Here they reside since years ago the Swiss banks: since the national bank, passing for the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär.
Enters the room of reception of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, before large chairs of leather are found, next to the logo of the bank there is a great sign to indicate the "security".
The UBS knows what the client seeks here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, in some moment they have displaced the idea of the great Swiss bank, or they have betraied it, like the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
It prefers not to read its name in the newspaper, when all is said and done does, as all the Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has done itself too large, thinks, chiefly in the banking of investments, where the Anglo-saxon have earned earthly.
There the Swiss did not have nothing but to say.
"And they have accustomed for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-saxon."
In fact, the UBS changed the banking of Anglo-saxon investments, delivered its first one great profit and then came the disaster, any European financial company had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the great Swiss bank.
October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of its nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in its book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
The politicians granted until 68 thousands of millions of Franks or approximately 45 thousands of millions of euro to save to the great bank of the bankruptcy.
How occurs them itself?
It is spoken with the Swiss bankers, thus they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June of 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks fuse in a powerful consortium.
A bank arises that, due to the fusion, was too large for the small one Switzerland, and continues growing.
For which it served so that the two different banks precursors of the UBS were complemented: a rich but asleep bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and an internacionalización poorer but stronger.
Suddenly, the investment banks internationalized arrived from opportune way with a lot of money, with the one that could cause to roll a great financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this ascent of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, leader of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"Always I thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team", the expert in banking says Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that understands a lot of models and statistical, and Ospel, the intuitive one that step since the learning in the bank to the summit managed to open."
Finally, Ospel trust Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli committed probably a decisive error: "It thought that its models were a reality", Geiger says.
"Is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Is clear: The blunder arrived before the case.
The employees of the UBS agree clearly of the meetings of executives, in which Wuffli, the leader of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Descending of the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be in the summit.
Some steps you left him well.
In the operations of currencies and in the negotiation of actions was in the higher.
Nevertheless, the management consultants in charge put of relief a weak point: In the business of the international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is an enormous compensation for the large banks.
The UBS has empty in the American mortgage products.
To fill these empty, the UBS began an adventure that almost its existence costs him.
Avid of growth, they invested so much the same bank as one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to entitle American mortgage loans and to sell them subsequently, maintaining you determined risks to own account.
And also, like other banks sought the lowering for a long time.
"In summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there", Geiger, expert in banking said.
So large the elation, so deep the fall.
A manager had to be gone, since the intent to order turned out to be more complicated of what expected.
The positions in the UBS became seats ejector and they are insecure to the present time.
At present, who directs a great bank, has an almost impossible work.
He should find a strategy for a bank, before the one that all the models of logical business be lost.
Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, to put an end to the banking of investments, to be concentrate on the administration of goods, to return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to arrive so far away (still).
But the banking of investments should diminish a lot, is clear at present.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In reality, alone thought itself about the Italian-Swiss one of 51 years as a transitory solution, since the bank the bank was separated surprisingly of its ancestor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he was imposed: It should direct in a permanent way the business of the UBS, communicated the bank of Zurich Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its state in the middle of the ninety.
It suppresses 3,500 positions.
But this does not suffice.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is?
With what wants to win money?
These they are the questions that sure is done Axel Weber at present.
Up to now alone he says that first he will seek a dwelling with his woman in Zurich.
The following year.

Europe cannot free itself so quickly of a recession, besides there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of the investments, alone confirmed this precaution, yet is not clear if Europe is it sufficient strong to do all that is needed for put an end to the crisis, affirmed in an interview for the CNBC.
Therefore, since its point of view is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead of that, it throws for the gunwale a decade of old principles and enters the American technological sector.

Intelligent rooks extend in the cities
In many places the rooks are considered "problematic birds" : themselves is not expelled to these inteligentísimos animal of the cities for a long time, they affirm the experts.
To some they like, other they want to be freed very fast of them, the rooks belong since years ago to the image of the city, but in many municipalities they accumulate the complaints of the neighbors by the mess and the noise of the animals.
Although no middle has appeared against the "problematic birds" up to now.
The rooks no longer leave the cities, they affirm the experts in the first symposium on rooks in Reading, Friesland oriental.
There the specialists of all the national territory discuss on possible solutions.
They seek alternatives in the cities
The ecologists attribute the problems from the cities to the migration of the field of you determined rooks protected; the chemical applications in the agriculture finish visibly with the traditional living spaces.
The hunt, the growing building and the fall of trees that lodge they complicate them the life of the birds.
The rooks are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 reproductive couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Reading.
There in 2005 it jumped the negative holders of the press a controversial project to kill in mass to the rooks of the district.
The critics have qualified the hunt of the animals by means of traps for birds and the murder with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expelling them and scaring away in a normal way itself nothing is obtained" declared Werner Klöver, town planner and landscape painter of Reading.
Shooting with water to the nests or to throw the trees are used to being consequences done not desire, affirms also Manfred Kaiser, expert in environment of Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies of divide and they distribute in other places."
Scare away alone is imaginable like exception in hospitals, residences of elders or schools.
"We should live with them, no longer we trap them."
Without the outskirts, itself not the problem in the cities is solved, thinks Wolfgang Kellner, mayor to Read.
It is possible a combination to scare away to the animals of sensitive residential areas and baits so that be written down again in other places.
"Informative boards instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist does publicity against in order to that treat to the animals of a completely different form: "The best is that we can endure a peak in the face with poise."
Jürgens cofounded in Schleswig-Holstein the circuit of teaching on the rooks of Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of the intelligent birds.
In the meantime, the project is accepted for the tourists.
Jürgens has also its own opinion on the criticisms by the noise of the birds: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot that to say."
The intelligence and ability of these animals they are legendary, the not alone rooks take advantage of the resources to agree to bites schists, if that do not they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etólogos of the University of Cambridge they verified in four rooks to where the intelligence of the birds arrives.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that should drop a stone on a platform for thus reach a larva of moth.
Without a lot of training, they recognized with decision the size and the form that should have the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the astute rooks should resolve a complicated problem.
The investigators placed a small bucket with a larva of moth in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not arrive at their prey with the peak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With the one that the four animals formed a hook, with the one that fished the bucket in the marksman of the pipe.
Three of the fours rooks obtained it in the first intent.

Massacre to personal level
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow) : An intimate history about the First World War, "begins with a long one dramatis personae of the type that can do that to one the soul to the feet fall.
I have here some counsels of action: Start gently this page and become its mark pages.
It will come know very well these people in the narration fiction of the Mister Englund, and this dramatis personae will function like its GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, be confused and deserted in the fog of the war.
The Mister Englund is a historian and swedish journalist.
Also it is the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, that grants the Nobel Prize of Literature.
What has written here is an unusual book, that describes, wise, as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some notable names, important or famous treaties you battle; practically there are not ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what occurred, explains, as "a book about how occurred". Treats about "feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor".
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" combines the experiences in times of war of more or less 20 men and ordinary women, to both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, conductors of ambulance and administrative.
Some of these people they will become heroes.
Some they will become prisoners of war, or they will lose their members, they will go crazy or they will die.
Its lives blink here as on votive candles in a church; some new are added to the mixture while other they are put out.
The book of the Mister Englund is a deviation of the books of standard history.
Is also a corrective one to the notion that the First alone World War was the ill-fated trench warfare in the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves from expert form through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the oriental front, Mesopotamia, Africa of the east.
To the soldiers in this book fall them on top the hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse-tse are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost since the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that infects to cordite.
When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you are a woman that is at home with your children, ¿remain or flee?
Of all forms ¿who comes?
Hardly anybody understands what is happening, not even why this war he has to fight himself.
"Lack in fact", observes the Mister Englund, "he has been filled with conjectures, suppositions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of the conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the deep-sea fleet.
Its histories have been obtained in their greater part by memory, letters and another material already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are fuller of life in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, of the Mister Englund.
Many of these are about hardships and to fix them to him with what there is.
About counting the history of a German schoolgirl says: "Substitute, all over substitute".
"Substitute of coffee, false aluminum, rubber of imitation, bandages of role, buttons of wood."
It continues speaking of the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "done meat from rice stew and pressed in grease of ram (and concluded with a bone false fact of wood); done tobacco of roots and peelings of dry potatos; shoes with soles of wood".
There is, observes, "837 replacements permitted of the meat in the production of sausages, 511 replacements of the registered coffee".
Some histories are about the honor and the value.
An American recognizes his own impulse toward the savagery and he declares about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what the men are conceived and not to be sat down in chairs with a cigar and a whisky, the newspaper in the afternoon or a best seller, and to intend that that varnish signifies civilization and that there is not a barbarian behind that shirt front starched and studded."
On the other hand a British soldier realizes that probably he will die, and that nobody will be informed or he will import him.
"Once one it is resigned to the thought to be sacrificed, to one he would like to think that would be able to occur in front of the public", writes.
On the other hand, horribly is seemed "to a condemned being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old one Europe disappearing, and about of new types of terror.
"The conflict has been converted each time more in an economic competition", writes the Mister Englund, "a war among factories".
It reflects the arrival of what calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The murderer in eloquent mass and convinced ideologically with clothes of good making that executes his meat market while he is seated behind a desk".
The people behaves in an unexpected way; there is so much ignoble as heroic behavior.
The Mister Englund speaks of the soldiers that tried actively to catch a venereal illness of prostitutes as a way of to evade the service in the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the commerce of pus gonocócico, that the soldiers buy and they besmear with it his genitals with the hope to finish in the hospital", he writes.
"Those that are truly desperate they rub it on its eyes, what often gives rise to a blindness by life."
In this translation of the Swede done by Peter Serious, the prose of the Mister Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to its human task.
In dozens of small reflected scenes the way in which the war to "untied exceptionally uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
The people begins ask why its leaders are causing them fighting.
The better books about the First World War often have been indirect, as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as as usual in the front of Erich María Rebrand, instead of integral histories.
The volume of the Mister Englund joins with a conventional little pantheon.
Its book has one of the most devastating ends than I can recall in a work of not fiction.
It I will not reveal.
But is as if to have arrived since its book, started from among your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and it to have burned with a match.
After a step in false prior, a robbery planned to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of they carrying riot helmets.
The night was chosen on Monday to Tuesday because the park Zuccotti would be emptier.
The operation was maintained in secret save for a few officials of highly rank, saying initially to the others that they were being joined with an exercise.
The inspector of police Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, its presence underlined how the operation plagued itself of challenges for the department of police.
They could not be repeated the episodes of recent weeks, like the crushing of espray pepper on the demonstrators, infringing the norms of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy toward the "okupas".
And because of it the police operation to clear the park Zuccotti of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared seeing as they had developed the occupations in other cities.
A semblance of greater catastrophe was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking at toward Zuccotti.
The agents increased the disorders training call - measures contraterroristas that implied to mobilize quickly to a great police officials number - to be centered in the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, in the side of Manhattan of the river East.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute", someone he said familiarized with the orders, that they referred to the alone mission as "an exercise".
"To the few cops that know that were calls for this, him did not they tell that was to enter the park Zuccotti", the person said, that he spoke of anonymous form.
"The only people that knew that were going to enter in the park Zuccotti were in the highest levels of the department."
A reason for the excessive secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they desisted when hundreds of demonstrators arose before time after to have heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday implied agents of several police units, including you force special of all the municipal district - scores of mobile agents that habitually were used to flooding the neighborhoods with highly index of criminality.
The Mister Kelly said that many people, like those that travel daily at work, they had been going and coming from the park during the day, doing from the 1 to.m. a good hour to enter.
"It was appropriated to do it when was the smaller number of people in the park", said.
Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with foci and loudspeakers congregated in the crossing of Pike Briefs with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before leaving.
The lights and the messages pregrabados that resounded since the loudspeakers they seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
The agents of common matters went to the park with their windbreak blue space, many demonstrators simply collected their things and they were themselves.
Himself not any store to the 1:45 was touched to.m., the police said, giving time to the demonstrators to collect his belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen being met in the perimeter to enter if was needed to do detentions in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the Police head of the department spokesman, he said that he was by his security.
But many journalists said that he tried to avoid that to see the police to enter action in the park, and that had been treaties unceremoniously by the agents.
The Mister Browne said that the mobile units of television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
To the extent that the police moved toward the west through the dense tangle of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggages and trash bags of role and of plastic packed of clothes, teams of the Department of Cleaning continued them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators that refused to be moved were dragged was, appearing on the Internet little images time later.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the zone of kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some they did a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Around some 10 people in the epicenter of the camp they were locked among them by the arms.
And two people were chained to trees, the Mister said Kelly.
The agents of the service of emergencies were calls to cut the padlocks.
Himself not arrests in the park were done to more or except the 3:30 to.m., the Mister said Kelly.
The operation of clearness was complete some 75 minutes later, the police said.
The Mister Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests they were by "alteration of the law and order and resistance to the authority", he said.
The highest-ranking agent in the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the uniformed upper official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the leader of detectives of the department, also was there.
The Mister Kelly, while been present, "was not directing the operations", the Mister said Browne.
A second group of agents expected along the oriental side of Broadway, among the streets Liberty and Cedar, in the event that they had that to enter.
Barricades were raised on the street Cortlandt, a block to the north of the park, and on the street Pine, a block to the south.
Since those positions, the police expanding was seen the perimeter even beyond the park Zuccotti.
In a moment given, a series of agents, many of them with shields, they were seen pushing to the people toward outside.
There was some 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the noisiest action at night took place to the south of the park.
In around at 5 o'clock to.m., to the south of the street Pine, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a car of police, and to other he was seen him removing the air of the wheels of a van of police.
In a moment given, a piece of plywood left flying since the multitude.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The support workers union will demand to the city by the dismissals
The union that represents to hundreds of workers of school support that lost its jobs last month plans to demand to the city Wednesday, alleging that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on the schools that attend poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort by revoking the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two assistants of the school, the coordinators of parents and other employees that were among the worst-paid of the city lost their work October 7, in a movement that the union leaders have described as a political revenge by their refusal to permit, last spring, the access on the part of the city to a fund of health care in charge of working parties To close their budgetary gap.
The municipal authorities have denied categorically that accusation.
In an audience in the City Hall last month, the counselor of education, Dennis M. Walcott, he said that the dismissals were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Counsel counterattacked telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the personnel of support of the school said good-bye.
Officials of the municipal district 37 said that they presented the claim in writing, notifying to the Department of Education that would be demanded. A press conference Wednesday will be celebrated to announce the official presentation of the demand, in the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include the Mr. Walcott and to the Department of Education of the city as accused, and counts on eight workers said good-bye like the plaintiffs, all they black or latin American women, just like the majority of the assistants that lost its jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, he said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a rough draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has been centered in the number of dismissals in the schools of poor zones of the city to support a claim by unjust deal, saying that the poor schools lost more assistant, since insufficiently they had been subsidized of chronic form.
It is indicated that though did not there were dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in the schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 they said good-bye in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx.
Keeping in mind the loss of five of the eight employed assistants by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where the 68 percent of the students they live in the poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents that can collect funds to cover the budgetary deficit".
P D. The budget of the district 36 was reduced in 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the form in which calculates the additional financing for each registration by poor student in the schools.
The union also affirms that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memo that authorizes the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memo utilized the word "surplus" to describe the action, in spite of the fact that "surplus" describes with greater frequency the act to transfer to a teacher of the payroll from a school to a market of work, whose salaries are full by the headquarters.
"Sixty-six coordinators of parents said good-bye", the rough draft of the complaint says, "and not only in surplus".
Mission finished, the Congress prepared to arrive at an agreement on Libya
Seems that finally republican and democrats in the Capitol are willing to be come to an agreement on something related to the lifting in Libya.
Everything that it was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi to be captured and murdered and the participation U.S. arrived at its end.
Tuesday, the Committee of Exterior Matters of the Senate is going to consider a resolution, sponsored by the president John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), along with the senators John McCain (republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans by its successful rebellion and to the troops of United States by its "bravery".
"This resolution is to honor to the brave of Libya, upon beginning to reconstruct its country", said Kerry.
"Is an affirmation of two-party support for its democratic aspirations."
The language can seem inoffensive, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy up to now.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought themselves between itself and with the White House on the editing of a series of resolutions to approve or to reject the role of the soldiers of United States in the mission of the NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the military use limited of forces of United States in Libya.
The government bill was defeated in the Camera by an extensive two-party margin, and that never came be voted in the Senate.
But the same day in which the government bill was rejected in the Camera, the camera also rejected a measure that would have trimmed the funds for the American operations in Libya.
That left the mission of United States in a species of legislative purgatory - with the Congress it sufficiently I bother as to criticize the management on the part of Obama of the mission, but not so angry like for in reality to reap the herb under its feet.
Subsequently, the indecision of the Congress was surpassed by the events.
Tripoli fell in the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered October 20.
The mission of the NATO finished officially October 31.
Now the Senate would be able to be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee of Exterior Matters "congratulates to the town of Libya by its tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to be freed to itself" and "praises the men and women of the Armed Forces U.S. and to its associates of the coalition that participated in military operations to protect to the town of Libya by its extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition toward the democracy in Libya."
It will win the new measure the complete support of the commission of Exterior Matters, or will divide the legislators as did the government bill of June?
The last version was rejected by the senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main republican of the committee.
The spokesman of Place said Monday that had not seen still the final version of the new government bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the Camera is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a stable budget, a legislative priority for almost all the republican congresspersons and some democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the republican one Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any another theme that in fact achieve a voting of all the assembly in the Camera or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators done not be successful up to now to cause to arrive their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of intents.
That of Goodlatte is alone one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, that they cover an extensive range of themes.
Some they are duplicates - the same government bill is proposed so much in the Camera as in the Senate - and other with light variations among itself.
There is at least 15 versions of the amendment of the so alone budgetary equilibrium in the Camera, and another handful that "will control the federal expense."
Some of those government bills also they are identical among itself, but give its sponsors - above all inexperienced republicans that seek to refine their currículums - the opportunity to be boasted that they were the "authors" of measured happiness.
The Budget Control Law, that was approved in August, requirió that so much the Camera as the Senate they voted an amendment of the budgetary equilibrium.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a not binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, various members want to limit the number of mandates that the members of the Congress can comply, while the representative José E. Mountain (democratic by New York), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to an education of quality and sanitary attention, among others themes.
An amendment that prohíbe the homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as a that prohíbe burns it of flags.
Some legislators also want to permit the annulment of the federal laws if they are rejected for two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that have been the members at the moment of to propose amendments, themselves they are not moving to a faster rhythm than in previous years.
In the 111º Congress, the legislators proposed 77 modifications, and they presented 66 in the 110º.
The rhythm is unacceptable in comparison with that of the decade of 1990, when the members presented regularly more than 150 amendments every other year, according to well-proportioned figures by the Library of the Senate.
But they did not have a lot more success then of what have it now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposal by the Congress in 1789.
"It struck but done not defeat," Giffords speaks in its first interview in TV since the cross-fire
Ten months after a gunman shot point blank in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democratic by Arizona) appeared in the national television the night on Monday, he sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway "The sun will leave tomorrow" and said that wanted to be recovered more than what wanted to return to the Congress.
In its apparition in ABC News “20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed aid for walk.
The program documented its difficult road of return of the caused damages by a bullet that the skull fractured him and perforated the left side of its brain, and that step since the front to the subsequent part of its head.
Three months ago, returned for surprise to the Camera to emit its triumphant vote in the agreement of the ceiling of debt.
In its first television interview since the cross-fire of January, that killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, itself rio and sang - and described its recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how feels, Giffords, of 41 years, responded: "Well enough".
The interview with Giffords and its husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" of an hour of duration, that the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple was emitted," Gabby: A history of courage and hope".
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the cross-fire of January 8.
In engraved videos by Kelly in the first weeks, it he is seen in his bed of hospital, with the shaved head and a long scar crossing his front.
She only can maintain one or two fingers straightened up, while its husband encourages it.
Months later, he is seen Giffords seated in a wheelchair while the therapists teach him how to carry out simple actions.
A movement of head.
A gather of the lips.
And then, its first word: "What".
In few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "toast", a request of change in its menu of breakfast.
Videos diffused by ABC show that the music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congressperson singing along with the therapists is seen the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" of Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours ago of therapy every day, he said that he does not recall the day of the cross-fire.
Its husband said that he was reading him to Giffords an article of the newspaper on the murder of March 12 when she stopped it to ask for the first time about the six that had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Reads Loughner, person under arrest in a prison is found of Missouri and is being medicated for the force while expects judgment.
"Many people died", told Giffords to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told her Sawyer that in a moment of the recovery of her wife, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So, I told him," 'Gabby, you have not been defeated,'" he said Kelly.
"So alone you have been struck.
And you are going to leave this, and are going to recover you and are going to return with more forces that never."
The troops cause they feel more pity than respect
The event was a gala of Wall Street that collected million dollars for the veterans without home in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on the impotence, the frustration and the loss.
Just then, various hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines burst in their positions around him.
The multitude of label stood up and they applauded.
"The men and women were you considered as the heroes", David said Saltzman, who organized the spring funds collection.
A military official of highly rank in the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Greater State, the admiral Mike Loosen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They showed him as an orphan boy species", he wrote the official in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
Themselves that had them.
But was not respect, truly. Was pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relation that itself there is attorney of the soldiers and an often distant American public, at times, worshiper.
Lavishes to the troops with compliments by its sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public each time more acts as if they gave suffers him those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all", the general of brigade said they Be B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon will leave toward Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some they show its support is to put us us in the role of souls deserted."
The theme is a very sensitive theme for the military leaders, that do not want to seem unappreciative or in disagreement with the public to which they serve.
Also they realize that the ira to which the troops were faced that returned in recent years of the Vietnam War was a lot worse.
As a consequence, the majority of the conversations on the pity they are carry out in silence and in private among the veterans of war.
After its two children returned from to fight with the marines, the colonel withdrawn Mark Cancian notified them that the people aside from the soldiers would consider its service since two perspectives.
Some they would look at with a feeling of fear due to that were faced the rebels and they travelled to exotic places.
Other they would be asked if there would be a "veteran angry and violent under the surface", he said Cancian, that he fought in Iraq and he returned to a work of highly level of the government in Washington.
During its search of employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly if would be capable of enduring under the pressure of an exacting work of Washington immediately after its tour of battle.
"When you speak about your service, need to face the negative impressions", recalled Cancian counting it to him its children.
The military anxiety arises, in part, of the American indifference toward the wars.
The achievements in the country of battle are rare chosen time for the praise on the part of a country that has little familiarity with the soldiers and he sees few direct benefits of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, like nation, no longer we value the military heroism so that they were of the all common in World War Two", the lieutenant general withdrawn said David Barno, who he commanded the troops of United States in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the compliments of the politicians and of the public are centered in great measure in the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized for the number of tours that have borne, the number of friends that have lost or the reach of their wounds.
The army confronts a growing pressure to put an end to the violation
This week, a historic audience will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army by their supposed passiveness before the violation.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the following one.
The soldier of first Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks of embarrassment the night in which she says that he was violated by a companion.
It was October of 2008, and was directed of return to its headquarters in the Air Base Miramar, to the north of San Diego, after the supper with a friend when was found with a colleague that carried a package of 12 tin platings of beer.
He asked him if he could be joined with her in his room to take a cup.
"It sounded a warning sign", says Lyman.
Nevertheless, the native of Texas left to one side his worry.
I thought, not, has 19.
"It is of Texas", says.
"I hope to have listened to my instincts."
To the few minutes to enter the room of Lyman, the man approached him himself from behind, throwing it downward and violating it, he alleges.
This week, November 18, Lyman and other 27 members of the current military personnel and old they expect anxiously a judicial decision in a historic judgment that will be celebrated in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide if the demand that have interposed against the exsecretario of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to judgment.
The demand alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the violation generalized among the soldiers, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
It presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, D.C., the demand implied initially 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all they affirm that were violets or attacked sexually by its companions, and that the army failed at the moment of to investigate, to process, or to give adequate justice after the supposed aggressions.
Burke says that goes to by the greater page of the army, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is an upper structure downward", says.
"¿Who are the people that are in conditions to eradicate the culture of the retaliations? The high command."
Burke also he says that from February, they have itself placed in contact with her near 400 survivors more, many of which could be part of future you demand.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating to all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in a same basket, by thus tell it, is going to present various cases, of being necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The team of the defense for the Department of Defense, headline by the federal public prosecutor Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to reject the case.
The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, they detail the strategy of defense -in essence, that the soldiers cannot be demanded for current or old soldiers by the wounds suffered in the armed forces.
By a sentence of the Supreme Court of 1950 call the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not a head by the damages suffered by the personnel in active service.
"The damages alleged are part of the active duty of the plaintiffs", the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article.
The things have changed since the years 50.
While to the women still is them officially prohibited to serve in battle, this distinction is only nominal: The wars modern rare time have clear the lines of the front.
So much in Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldier are playing role increasingly more important, especially to arrive at the local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of battle.
It is hour that the army also be modernized, says Burke.
She is not alone in their fight, and other three demands are in motion, besides theirs.
In the Faculty of Right of Yale, the Clinic of Legal Services for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies by supposedly promote a misogynous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army that itself center in the diagnoses of "inconvenience of the personality" assigned the victims of violation in order to giving them the high one of the service -a common event, according to the activists, like Anu Bhagwati of the Women Action Network in Service, a group of human rights.
Its group presented a demand in December against the Administration of Veterans, accusing of discriminatory practices in the form in which handles the claims of benefits for the people that say to have been attacked sexually in the service.
Nine government bills have been presented by separated in the Congress on the part of a two-party mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual aggressions denounced, according to the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual Aggression and Answer of the Department of Defense.
Nevertheless, the aggressions notably infra are denounced, and by the own estimations of the Pentagon, that figure in approximately the 13.5 percent of the 19000 incidents reckoned that they were produced that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the indices of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases denounced in the army went to judgment - the half that in the system of civil justice.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, they describe their attacks as alone the first one of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, denounced the presumed violation to the military police less than one hour after to occur.
That night, he says, him he was asked that he counted the details of his violation 11 different times to a multitude of police officers, medical, and commanders.
She was submitted to a kit of violation, and the blood of its aggressor -of a cut in its arm- was found in its bed.
Six months later, in April of 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which him was asked about that to have had sexual relations with its boyfriend the day of the attack.
Six people declared as the witnesses of personality in name of the presumed author, that was finally acquitted.
"Memory the day in which the verdict read itself", says Lyman.
"I thought that was going to go to work me -I found me shouting since the room."
"They put me in the unit of psychiatry, and when I left, memory that I told him my official of command," "That was not its judgment. That was my judgment".
To Lyman him was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, that finally an inconvenience of the personality diagnosed him, what did it ineligible for the service.
In January of 2010 was excused of the service low terms less-that-honorable, what impedes him to receive any benefit.
As for if the case presented by Lyman and its companions of demand continues, is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Right in the Faculty of Right George Washington.
Nevertheless, it indicates, "In my opinion, they should be capable of continuing ahead".
What is interposed among them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since was published for the first time.
I have been a permanent critic of the Doctrine Feres.
The army is decades from behind because does not have the same incentive and dissuasion that plant the responsibility.
And it adds: "The odds are hardly against them... but is important for they to try it."
These alone things change when the good people is willing to fight.
If the audience does not go for its road, Burke, lawyer of the plaintiffs, will put to the queue to its other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We are going to continue fighting against the army in this theme until the reform be produced", says.
"Or until we wall us, what occur first.
The walls have eyes: How the investigators are studying you in Facebook
Before being become the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired its points of view anti-immigration in line.
Monday, Breivik, who admitted to have carried out a killing in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, was faced to its first public judicial audience.
While Breivik should have acted alone, was far from being alone in the cyberspace: It had passed most of the time that preceded their attack set against their computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists that support to the groups of right in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the investigators wanted to know more about these people.
But, ¿how to find them?
Easy - only you have to enter Facebook.
"We realized that was not so difficult to arrive at them", says Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently on the European digital populism by the center of British studies we GIVE.
The alijo of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the investigators would be able simply to utilize the tool of publicity to determine their demographic characteristics desired with a scientific precision - the way that the salespersons have been utilizing during years.
The team of Bartlett found half million of fans of the groups of right in every Europe and then directed announcements, but instead of linking them to a new band or product of diet, the announcements invited the users to complete a survey that asked on their educational level, attitudes toward the violence and the optimism on their own future.
Upon arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and its colleagues were capable of studying at more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of far right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It is a completely new form to do an investigation", says Bartlett.
Some of the results they are not of the all surprising: The followers in line of the groups of right tend to be youths, men and angry by the immigration.
Nevertheless, in a species of turn, "those that combine their activism in line with the activism off-line they are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that they remain behind the screen of the computer".
The work of we GIVE is alone an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of the scientists.
Centers of investigation, medical investigators and political scientists are utilizing the place to study all, from problems of health to social tendencies just as they are expressed in the "I like", messages in the walls and updatings of state.
With more than 800 million users assets adding an average of three pieces of content to the day, the "supernova of data" of Facebook is generating a boom of the investigation, prompting the number of academic works with the name of the place in the title to almost a 800% in the last five years.
For some investigators, the beauty of Facebook is that permits you to study the people to the ones that you could not approach you with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried encuestar to people of the British National Party, was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have that to go through the party, and they never would permit you the access", he says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Other they say that the place would be able to provide a way to identify and to undertake the problems of health-social.
A recent study carried out by the doctor Megan Dark, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues, he found that the university students that spoke of their feats of drunkenness in Facebook had a significantly greater risk to have problems with the beverage that the students that remained in silence on the theme.
Dark it suggests that the companions of the students, such as the residential counselors, they would be able to control the place and to intervene to help a student that publish too many updatings of state with their drunkennesses.
"You cannot treat a problem if cannot diagnose it", he said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Dark and director of the health center, Behavior and Development of the Boy in the Institute of Childlike Investigation of Seattle, the Washington said Post.
"We have found a way to identify children in risk that of another way they would not be diagnosed."
Facebook also is constantly "puncturing" to its own population to obtain data.
The Team of Data of the place has elaborated statistical on the state of the relation and the Day of San Valentín, the expectation of voter turnout to half of the legislative period of 2010, and an index of National Happiness (chiefly utilizing the information to which can be agreed - defenders of the digital liberty for a long time they maintain that the place should put at the disposal of other its great Quantity of data for the investigation).
Nevertheless, the users of Facebook know that the place is watching, like or not - the sacrifice by being able to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometers of distance is to permit that the place mine your personal information.
But ¿what happens when the users of Facebook become a part of a survey that not even they know?
While the investigators have well definite guidelines on how collect its data off-line, in line is a free bar for all.
"Do not I believe that many of the users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be examining his profiles", he says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a study of 2006 that he carried out with the public walls of Facebook of students.
"In which to them concerned, was only among them and its friends."
Then is the question of the methodology.
Even off-line, there is not guarantee that a theme of investigation this being completely honest.
In Facebook, is impossible to know that splits of the information of the profile of a user and of the messages of the wall they are true.
"What you say in Facebook and what cause were of Facebook are two completely different things", he says Selwyn.
That it is why, in spite of their years as the investigator of the technology, Selwyn he believes that a paper clip and a ballpoint pen continue being the better tools of investigation that nobody can utilize.
"There is not replacement to enter the real world and to speak with the real people", says.
"The social investigation is supposed that is on the social thing - and a pile of the social thing still happens off-line."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik does its first public apparition in the court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man that confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described to itself as a combatant of the "resistance" during its first public apparition in the court of Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the movement of Norwegian resistance and in the Gentlemen Templars of Norway", he said before a full room with 500 people.
"I oppose me to the court, since received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of the hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo."
"I recognize the facts but me do not I declare guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted to Breivik during that monolog, because "did not want to give to Breivik the opportunity to utilize this audience as a platform so that express its points of view".
By the same reason refused to permit to Breivik, that brought a speech written with advance, to be directed the relatives of its victims in the end of the audience.
Nesheim also the police ordered to maintain to Breivik in custody during 12 weeks more, he prohibited the access to the mass media during four weeks, and he said that the authorities would have that to have a strict control on all the visits and the correspondence during eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the audience.
Some they came with the hope to look at to Breivik to the eyes, other to confirm that he is found imprisoned under lock and key.
All they attended with the objective to advance toward the conclusion.
"I thought that cold seemed and inhuman", a survivor said of Utoya to the issuing one NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for was a step ahead after seeing and to hear the suspect."
They dressed with a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik was maintained calm and professional along the audience and looked at the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when entered and the building left.
In spite of the strange notion of Breivik to be part of a movement of "resistance" greater, the judge determined that he is not a sick mental one, and he said that there is not proof that he acted with accomplices.
It is possible that to some console them that the attacks of July 22 seem to be work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not smooth out automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feels.
"I would like that to seem a monster, but him does not seem", a relative of a victim said.
"Would be a lot more easy if it to seem."
7 Lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, they are shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, October 5, there were some that compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of the technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what the fans of Apple would be able to find more revealing, in an interview to Jobs recently redescubierta to which has been revived like advancement of a series of special projections in the greater markets this week, is how much understood this creative mind about the commercial processes and flows of work of the products.
It was without doubt a designer, dreamy and hippy autorreconocido, but was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of the flow charts - a man that believed that many executive sufrían "an illness that consists of thinking that a great idea is the 90 percent of the work... [but] There is an enormous quantity of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the series of television The Triumph of the Nerds (The triumph of the idiots) on the whiteness of the personal computer, and sat down for more than one hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
Just then had passed scarcely 10 years since Jobs had been obliged to be gone of Apple, and already worked intensely in its new data processing business NeXT, expecting the popular adoption of Internet.
While a small part of the interview of Cringely was utilized in Nerds, said that the original of the interview disappeared during its transportation.
It was only after the death of Jobs that a complete copy was discovered in VHS in the garage of the director.
This material of file, slightly reprinted, is the base of Steve Jobs: The interview loss, of 68 minutes, that arrives at the movies Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known by hating the interviews in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points along the interview, there are large silences among the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is weighing clearly its thoughts, seeking precision.
Also there are moments in which the perfectionism of Jobs leaves to the surface, where seems impatient due to the questions of Cringely, pushing him to go faster toward the themes or arguments of greater importance.
It filmed before it was of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The interview loss, when Jobs evaluates what sees that other companies do well and badly, and offers its own vision of the future of the data processing.
A thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the career of Jobs, but there is somewhat raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer to the edge of the greatness.
He has a vision of as they are able and should be the things.
Not long after explaining it all with detail here, was and did it.
A fast summary of seven notable sequences of The interview loss:
On how did it learn to carry a business:
"Along the years in the business, I always he asked: "" ¿Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you of invariable form they are: "Oh, that is alone the way as is done".
Nobody knows why does he do does, in the business nobody thinks about the things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs carries to the detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple.
It disconcerted by the form in the prices were registered - often beginning with a "standard price" that was done to eye of good cooper, and that then was adjusted with a "variable" - developed a factory automated that assured that they would be able to determine the commercial prices to the detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs relates the "Blue Box" that himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that permitted to the people hackear efficiently the telephone company and to do calls to long distance free.
It has written extensively about the device, but the elation of Jobs here upon describing the Blue Box as an act of empoderamiento is contagious.
He it describes how and Wozniak tested the box by means of the use of a pay phone, making a call, and then being connected since a network of AT & T to another, while created a loop with the greater quantity of possible satellites.
"We were wrapping the things around the world a half a dozen of times and you shouted through the pay phone and returned a minute later to the pay phone of the door from to the side", says Jobs with a giggle.
"We were youths and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that would be able to control thousands of million dollars in infrastructure everywhere."
We two, we did not know a lot, but we could build a small thing that could control a gigantic thing - was an incredible lesson, and do not I believe that never to have existed Apple without her.
Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that and Wozniak almost they abandon, calling to the Vatican one through the Blue Box in half at night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while did its better imitation of Henry Kissinger.
To the extent that various members of the catholic hierarchy were called in half at night to speak with the American diplomat, the two exploded in just laughter before the very same one Pope to be awoke for be going to answer the telephone.
On being fall in love with the technology (and the telephone sales with Bill Hewlett) :
At age 12, to the hunt of spare parts to build a bookkeeper of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone book and a call made him.
Shortly after its telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs obtained an employment of part-time summer in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a notable influence on me, was the only business that had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a business and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs was converted later in one of the employees of HP that visited the laboratories of investigation of the company in High Stick, where he saw "the first never done desktop computer".
Was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen of cathode pipe, and I fell in love with him.
It would obtain a trip to HP as the adolescent and waste time with that machine and would write programs for her.
On improvising the innovation:
In various points of the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in its career, since was dedicated to sell a base plates handful, a client asked him if could mount all the team.
Working with alone 30 days of credit, had to ascertain the assembly and the delivery of the devices finished.
Later, while it was in Apple, recalls the fights to the ones that was faced in the development of a mouse of computer:
"Me dramatic agreement to have arguments... they shouted me that five years would be needed [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I satiated me and I was was me and I found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that could build for 15 dollars and that was completely reliable.
On the large businesses losing force:
A lot before headed the renaissance of Apple, Jobs prophetically predicted the form in which many leaders of the industry would trip in their vision, and they would lose the control of their market share.
"I gave that you work in IBM or Xerox, for which do photocopiers and better printers, ¿and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, for which the business does not have more success.
The departments of sales and marketing enlarge the success, for which they are this class of people the ones that finish for directing the businesses and the people responsible for the products are expelled of the forum for it takes of decisions.
The genius of the products that carried to that position of monopoly rots because of people that do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary position.
That is what passed in Xerox...
Xerox would be able to have taken over all the computer industry.
Would be able to have been ten times its size, would be able to have been the Microsoft of the years 90...
They took the rout of the victory.
On the innovation as artistic expression:
"There is an enormous quantity of work between a great idea and a great product... to the extent that evolves the great idea, changes and grows."
It is learned a lot about the subtleties of the same one.
There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that cannot do that do the electrons, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to maintain 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - to adjust them all at the same time...
In the end all is reduced to the flavor - is lowered to try to expose you maybe that a team of humans has done, and then to try to adapt those things to the ones that your you are doing.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, the large artists steal.
Never we have had shame about stealing large ideas.
What in part did large to the Macintosh was that the people that were working in it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, that coincidentally were the better data processing scientists of the world.
If it was not by the data processing, could be doing marvelous things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the rival of the law of health care while the court accepts the case
The day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of if they would accept the challenge to the law of health care of the president Obama, two of their judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were guests of honor in a supper sponsored by the firm of lawyers that will expose the case before the high court.
The occasion was the past Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary audience to study in great detail the petitions of review.
One of the cases in question was a demand presented by 26 states challenging the total reform of the health care approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for the conservative activists in all the country.
The judges agreed to admit to procedure the demand and, in fact, expects a historic summing-up of 5 hours and a half for March, and the result probably will cloud still more the presidential career of 2012, that be in full height just as the decision of the court be known.
The lawyer that will appear before the court and will allege that the law should be rejected will be probably Paul Clement, who served as the attorney general of United States during the government of George W. Bush.
The firm of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen businesses that helped to sponsor the annual supper of the Federalist Company, a group that carries many years dedicated to the defense of the conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the supper, Jones Day, represents to one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Confederacy of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., that has an enormous financial interest in the result of the lawsuit.
The supper was celebrated in a hotel of Washington, hours after the preliminary audience of the court on the case.
Among the assistants was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important republican in the Senate and an opponent declared of the law of health care.
The special guests in the supper? Scalia and Thomas.
Is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Company during years.
And is not something that among in conflict with the norms ethics.
In fact, the judges are exempt of the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If him they were not, would be able to be told that they would fall under the Code Canon 4C, that says: "A judge can attend events to collect funds of organizations related to the law and other, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or to figure in the program of such event. "
Nevertheless, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law practices of lawyers in the case, as well as to a business with an enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm the activists of ethics in the government.
"This impressive gap of the ethics and indifference toward the code goes against the demands of various judges that obeys the court by the same rules that apply to all the federal judges", said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were guests of honor in a gala funds collection with lawyers that have pending cases before the court."
Its apparition and assistance in the collection of funds for this event undermines any demand of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by the criticisms that say that they mix too much easily the activity of the court with the agenda prompted by groups as the Federalist Company.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a noticeable conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives argue that is the judge Elena Kagan, the one that has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a procuradora general of the administration Obama when the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance were presented.
Its critics have pressured so that Kagan abstain to see the case, saying that was too much involved in defending the law as for now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that be going to do it.
Boeing receives an order record of 18 thousand million dollars
The airline Emirates asks 50 airplanes of double walkway Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six airplanes Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, an operation valued in more than thousand million dollars.
Rarely time is news when a business obtains an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a great transaction when the business is the airplane-maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 airplanes elevates to a record of 18 thousand million dollars.
It is as large as the place of where Boeing received the order: Middle east, a mine of gold in growth of future orders of airplanes.
In a study brought to light Monday, the company of Chicago esteem that during the next 20 years the airlines in Middle East will need 2,520 airplanes by value 450 thousand million dollars.
Boeing announced during the weekend its larger order of the history for commercial airplanes by its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 of double walkway.
The successful order wine of the airline Emirates in Dubái.
The airline has also an option to buy 20 airplanes more, what would elevate the total sale price to 26 thousand million dollars, announced Boeing in the Aeronautic Parlor of Dubái 2011.
Then, Monday, Boeing he said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, the call Dreamliner, that presumes of a savings of fuel and some services for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six of them is more than thousand million dollars.
"This has clearly an enormous positive effect for Boeing", the analyst said of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these clients particularly is very strong."
Many airlines of Middle East are property of their petroleum production companies nations.
Therefore, do not only they have the money to pay the airplanes, but an increase in the prices of the fuel - generally damaging for the airlines, because is one of the greater prices - is not so damaging, because the country is winning money with the increase of the price of the petroleum.
That is important because they have less odds than other airlines to cancel or to delay the orders of flight when the prices of the fuel enlarge, he said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection", he said.
The order of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the wide fuselage airplanes market and aid to maintain to line the intent of its competitive one Airbus BE to invade its control with the passenger plane A350.
The victory of Boeing in the fair of the air is produced four months after Airbus said that was going to delay the début of the largest one A350, that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the début to add more impulse after the clients to require an increase of the useful load and of the rank.
The actions of Boeing Co rose a 1.5% to 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the voting of Michoacán
Luisa María Cauldron affirms that the drug-traffickers helped their opponent of the PRI, Happy Vallejo, in the combat for governor.
The sister of the president Felipe Cauldron seems to have lost its candidacy to governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she affirmed Monday that the drug-traffickers helped to incline the career in favor of one of its opponents.
The preliminary results gave the front in the career for governor of the western state to Happy Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized during all the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not alone for Michoacán, but for all the country", said Luisa María Cauldron in an interview of radio a day after the voting on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, to our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and they ordered the people that voted" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico during seven decades until lost the presidency in 2000.
Nevertheless, it is it put in scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has the hope to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed nearly margin to Cauldron, who had headed the surveys before the elections.
Cauldron, a candidate of the National conservative Parted of Action of its brother, or BREAD, refused to recognize to Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of left by the Party Democratic Revolution, or PRD, that at present occupies the charge of governor, remained in third place, a great rout for the left divided and unfortunate before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalcalde of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with the drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been for a long time dominated by cartels of the drug specialized in marijuana, heroine and metanfetaminas.
It is the native state of the president Cauldron, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against the dealers in December of 2006.
Nevertheless the violence has persisted.
A mayor of the BREAD was murdered a week before the elections while did campaign by Luisa María Cauldron, and numerous candidates abandoned the local candidacies by fear.
Although for the PRI, by unpleasant that the elections they seem of Michoacán, a victory will help to prompt the party.
The man that is supposed he will represent to the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Rock Grandson, speaking from Washington, he congratulated to Vallejo and he said: "I believe that this victory should be very encouraging, with a view toward the next year".
The BAsD urges Asia to help to rescue to the euro zone
The Asian Bank of Development (BAsD) has done a calling to India and to China so that they be prepared to help to rescue to the euro zone of their crisis of sovereign debt for avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, general director of the Asian Bank of Development with headquarters in Manila, he said that the two large faster economies of growth of the world had that "to do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already went through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
It notified against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, Chinese] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in a way "impartial" and said that the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and European resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We are all together in this."
"So any that can help Europe to leave the crisis is useful", the Financial told Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but cannot be immune."
"So if Chinese and India they can help, that be for all the media."
The European monetary union has been seen seriously undermined by a crisis of sovereign debt in recent months.
In the last days, the prices of indebtedness of Italy have shot themselves dangerously and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has enlarged the fears that could push to the world economy to the recession and has generated calls so that the main emerging economies unite to help the euro zone to find a solution.
The Mister Nag predicted that any support of Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - as the purchase of the bonds of the fund of rescue of the EU, the European Fund of financial stability - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian associates of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian minister of Commerce, he said that "the India is going to do everything possible" to help the euro zone since its own economy now was suffering the fall of the exports and the exhaustion of the foreign capital inflow.
"Nobody wants that the euro zone continue being unstable and turbulent", said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."

Serious notices of the Pentagon about the possible cuts in defense
The secretary of Defense, Lion Panetta, heated the Congress Monday, notifying that the automatic cuts of budget that approach would be able to undermine the national security and to cause a financial reaction in chain since the walkways of the Pentagon, to the fields of battle of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon already is digesting the 450 thousand million dollars of reductions along the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if the Congress does not manage to arrive at an agreement on the expense.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastator for the department", said Panetta in a letter to the senators John McCain, republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, republican by Carolina Southern.
He said that the failure of the Congress to arrive at an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the call "abduction", would give rise to 23 percent of global reductions and a high one to many new projects.
"A so large cut, applied in this manner indiscriminate, would do that most of our naval projects and of construction they cannot be executed - cannot be bought three quarters parts of a ship or a building - and to damage seriously other efforts of modernization", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"Also we would see us obliged to set apart to many of our civil officials of involuntary form and, due to that the reduction would be imposed with so much rapidity, is almost sure that we would have that to graduate civilians in order to complying the objective."
"These changes would break the faith with those that maintain our army and they would damage seriously the good disposition."
The cuts with the time would reach to the troops of battle, he said Panetta.
"Though the financing for times of war in the contingency Operations accounts overseas itself is not seen directly affected by the abduction, the efforts of the war would be seen affected negatively by the serious inconveniences in the budgets of base", notified Panetta.
"The contracting of personnel would be reduced, what would carry to delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"The personnel in payroll would be reduced, giving rise to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time of war, and the legal support and politician would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of an abduction in the Department of Defense would cause a fast slope of the United States as main military power of the world."
"We are firmly against this draconian action", the senators in a joint communiqué said the afternoon on Monday when published the letter of Panetta.
"This it is not a result with the one that can live itself, and certainly is not one that should we impose on ourselves."
"The abduction is a threat for the interests of the national security of the United States, and itself should not be permitted that occur."
If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will enlarge the pressure for a budgetary commitment or they will intensify the calls to exempt to the Pentagon of the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly more clear on the possible cuts, in spite of the fact that arrived at a work in the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that was faced to difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, the secretary of Defense painted a somber panorama of what would be able to be in front - an army with a seashell, but not a nucleus.
"Is a ship without sailors."
"Is a brigade without bullets."
"It is an air wing without sufficient pilots coached."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of headquarters, buildings and bombs without sufficient soldiers qualified to comply the mission", said Panetta in its words of opening in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers the moral drop, the deficient preparation and is not capable of being maintained to the day with the potential adversaries."
"In fact, invites to the aggression. ..”
In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciates new details of how the reductions "generate important operating risks: delay in the time of answer to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; limits severely our capacity to be unfolded and compromised previously everywhere; and supposes an unacceptable risk in future operations of battle."
And Panetta said that some of the greater projects of defense would be able to confront the axe, included those that already they are being tested and some alone in the first phases of the planning.
Ready happiness includes the airplane of battle F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber predicted, the submarine ballistic of new generation, the new ship of coastal battle and the new vehicle of battle in land that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and the additional tests of the F35 would be able to generate some 80 thousand million dollars in savings along 10 years, but their followers say that is the following vital step to improve and to confront the potential threats of China and other rival.
As to detect a lie
A look to the most recent holders indicates us how serious and omnipresent are the deceit and the lie in the daily life.
The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each part accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been defendants of perjury by supposedly hide reports that said that a coach of soccer withdrawn was attacking sexually children.
Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with an open microphone affirming the president of United States, Barack Obama, that the Israeli prime minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The congressperson by New York and exhibitionist on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, did the ridiculous one with its contradicted quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in the financing of the campaign related to the cover-up of a relation extramatrimonial.
And, again, nobody that it to live will forget never the media circus untied by the president Bill Clinton upon lying during its second mandate about its sexual relation with Mónica Lewinsky.
They are very extended the legends on the traps in the exams of the school and the university.
Cases have been given in which the professors have given the answers of the exams to the students in order to being better seen in its evaluations of performance.
Mentors that should be teaching it opponent are sending the message that to lie and to deceive they are acceptable.
How much deceit we find us?
In a day any, the studies show that they can lie you in any place from 10 to 200 times.
That sure, many of those lies are white lies.
Another study showed that the strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes to be known.
Detecting lies, or "the locating of lies", is an essential ability that should acquire all, by personal so much reasons as the professionals.
Far from being a similar board game to, for example, Charade, where the objective is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of the deceit is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out projects of investigation in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
The liars yes look at to the eyes.
Do not always they stammer, they stammer, they blush or they disturb.
Themselves it cannot be concluded neither that the liars be difficult to detect or to unmask.
A lie detector coached can arrive at the truth learning about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, the formation of questions and the times.
I passed various years testing the scientific discoveries on the deceit in the vast and always emerging body of the knowledge, and was of course the detection of the deceit is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include the contracting, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
The good liars have the ability to read well to the others, causing feeling to flavor, handling their own emotions and feeling of intuitive form how do they perceive them the others.
We know for the investigations that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that the men say more "lies oriented toward itself", while the women say more lies "oriented toward the others" -- normally to protect the feelings of someone -- that the married people lie less often to their couples that the people that are not married (but the lies that are used to saying tend to be "enormous").
Also we know that if you are perceived as a criminal, the others they will feel less guilty upon lying him.
How know if someone is lying?
First, it observe the habitual conduct of the subject.
This it is called "to create a base-line".
It helps to provide points of reference to measure later the changes.
Observe the position of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It is better than knowing if someone normally pounds with the foot all the time for do not unjust accusations when see him the feet pounding in half of the meeting.
Subsequently, it seek groups of not verbal, verbal, and deceitful behavior.
Consider to these groups of behavior as warning signs, not like test of deceit.
The people that deceive can freeze the upper part of the body upon trying to recall their history, they can aim their feet toward the door, to be inclined toward an exit, to change their position in a significant way or to exhibit a "relief postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have finished.
Often the interrogators cause they see falsely that the interview has finished alone to seek that relief postentrevista.
Also I lend attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson put the leg to the fund and used last time while affirmed that its wife murdered was alive, launching a search of her to national level.
The people that deceive can also use a distancing language: "Did not I have sexual relations with that woman... the young lady Lewinsky" or to repeat a difficult question integrally.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a pile of "restrictive language" when answers to a difficult question: “Bueno.. to tell the truth... to what I itself... to my to understand."
This does that the answer be a perception instead of a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is not any magic formula to detect lies, but to develop abilities for discover the deceit is possible.
These abilities will improve the possibilities of any to avoid to be victimized by the artists of the swindle in their personal and professional lives.
The controversial plan of the devious pipeline after the threat of the delay of United States in its approval
Days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- maddening to the unions, while appeased the ecologists -- the business that seeks to build the pipeline says that is willing redirigir the project to direct it again.
TransCanada said Monday night that will move the pipeline planned out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts in which the project will win the approval.
The business announced the decision in the press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The executive of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, he says that the company maintains its confidence in which with the time the pipeline be approved, though is certain that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week on the part of the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permission for the project until new potential routes be studied that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the aquifer Ogallala, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This it is a true way of progress", the representative said Reads Terry, republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is possible that aside any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officials denied that the politics was wrapped in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the petition of the State Department, and all its expressed them support.
The pipeline, of 1,700 kilometers would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels for day of the province of Alberto to the refineries in Texas.
For it, it would be necessary that crossed six states.
He is hated for the ecologists, but loved by the working parties, that have bet on the estimation of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposite to the plan are weighing the legislation to force a removal of the region of Sandhills and of the aquifer Ogallala, the greater source of drinking water and of irrigation.
The study of current environmental impact of the State Department found that the alone project presented adverse environmental impacts limited, but the source of the energy industry said that the general inspector of the department has ordered an independent test of the process of review, being centered in two questions.
An it is if the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, that was advisor of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, he represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other it is if a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate election because was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle demanded by supposedly cause that a boy vomited of fear
A family of new York affirms that the diva of the disco music, Patti LaBelle, behaved as a lunatic in the vestibule of her building of Manhattan, terrifying its small daughter to the extent of that vomited of fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened to Genevieve Monk, of 18 months of age, so much that suffered "changes of personality, inconveniences of the dream" and "enlarged her fear to the strange", its family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan says.
It was November 10, last year when the stagehand Kevin Monk, their wife, Roseanna, teacher of kindergarten, and Genevieve they were being prepared to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Roseanna Monk descended to the vestibule of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with its luggage, carrying to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said that stopped near the door and put its daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone approached from behind and he told me," ¿you Know what is doing your daughter?' I told "yes 'and I went to catch it ", he said.
LaBelle admonished angry to the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone," should Not have left his daughter near the door", he said Roseanna Monk.
"I told him," I have no interest in which you say or be chirped".
It was maddened and began to use evils words - the word C and the word J aloud...
It had a bottle of water and began to throw the water of the bottle on me."
He said that Genevieve he was put hysterical.
"I told this woman," Sight what you have done my daughter", the mother of the girl said.
LaBelle he was thrown on the mother -- that still he held to Genevieve -- and he had to be contained by its environment and withdrawal to a car that expected it, said Roseanna Monk.
The small one was crying so strong that vomited, added.
Later, the family sent a note asking an excuse of LaBelle, but did not obtain answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment it happened.
The demand seeks damages done not specify, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that caught the case of free form and that the family plans to donate all the money that obtain to an association of support to the children with cancer.
"The purpose is to do to Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct", said Davis.
"That type of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when is directed a teacher of kindergarten that carries in arms to a boy of 18 months of age."
Climatic adversity braked the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has enlarged the unemployment and the informality, descended the foreign investment and contracted the economy
The 2011 it is a year that will be recalled in the economic history of Sinaloa, is a matter of the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, called of the change, that generated large expectations with respect to the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of start of year, itself not growth is observed, on the other hand yes a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development is registered.
The low temperatures of February, besides causing millionaires losses for the agricultural sector, they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, they caused a contraction of the economic activity in general of 3,6 percent in the first semester of the year, justified chiefly by the historic fall of 31,16 percent in the agriculture, that affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.

Smaller liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of economics and Social of the OR, the growth of the unemployment can be explained indirectly, in function of the actions that since the public politics they have been carried out.
"What is being seen is a growth of the unemployment that has to do with various factors, among them the loss of liquidity in the market by effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in the congress to fight the money laundering, already for the people that gets dollars in an illicit way him is not easy that work them, invest them and utilize them in Something", it expressed.
Detained migration
López Cervantes indicated that in the increase in the unemployment exists also a demographic factor.
"The number of people that goes of the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have also many difficulties for find work, those people is remaining and is demanding sources of work here in the state, what does that the unemployment be elevated", declared.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market sinaloense is aggravated upon considering the high level of informality that dominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60,38 percent of the working population in the state works without to be quoting as the worker before any institution of social security.
It combined to the unemployment and informality, another of the labor surpluses of the state are the low salaries, the company has the remunerations more drops of the Country, according to the registrations of the Mexican Institute of the social security and the Office of the secretary of the Work and Social Forecast.
The income monthly average of the industrious sinaloenses was, to September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, very under the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
It combined to the fall of the economic activity and the increment in the unemployment, during 2011 the greater decrease of the Direct Foreign Investment of the last 10 years is registered, according to the Office of the secretary of Economy from January to June of the IED state added 630 thousand 697 dollars, what represents a fall of 87,74 percent with respect to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 registered dollars during the same one Period of the previous year.
In turn, the Office of the secretary of Economic Development of the state Government counts a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, occurred chiefly of businesses of the tertiary sector.

"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, one must work intensely to recover the land that lost in this year, in the 2012 we have to redouble efforts, lacked to align the effort of all and above all the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we expect that the next year be a lot better", expressed.
Economic slowness

Cut validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in the 2015
The replacement of analog signs by digital is one of the most important changes than has suffered the world in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that interposed the Senate and the Camera of Representatives against the presidential decree that advances the call "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, upon not being met the eight necessary votes to nullify it.
A minority of four ministers, included the president of the Cut, Juan Forest Rock, considered that the president Felipe Cauldron was not exceeded in its attributions upon emitting the decree that details the actions to continue to summarize the transition to the terrestrial digital television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected by reach not the majority qualified as eight votes so that the Cut was pronounced on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The project of sentence, elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Lamb, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, due to that the regulation of the matters of radio and television is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reserve of law.
In favor of the project they voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Brown, Margarita Moon and the own one Sánchez Lamb.
With this argument, so much the Senate as the Camera of Representatives they promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and upon admitting the demands, the minister Sánchez Lamb suspended the application of the decree and of all the in it arranged actions for the digital transition.
The full one of ministers resolved to reject also the demand interposed by the Camera of Representatives, without entering to the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Lamb.
In its intervention, the minister president said not to coincide with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through guidelines the measures so that the public administration be prepared.
"Do neither I consider that if did would be affected it the autonomy of the regulating organ", and recalled that the planning of public politics in strategic areas as the sector of telecommunications correspond the federal Executive, who considers constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analog signs by digital is one of the most important changes than has suffered the world in recent years, and is translated in a better one aprovechamiento of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the sign and more channels.
Postponing the change, maintained, would be to defer the benefits of the digitization, that implies a decision of public interest, that does not have only a technical dimension, "therefore covers political, social, economic questions and of national security".
These questions, emphasized, "they require the operation of all the system established, in agreement at the beginning of economic rectory of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution conducts to the faculty of the state Executive".
It recalled that a great number of countries everywhere has concluded already the digital transition, and the Executive has done it, despite include technical organs highly specialized.
Himself cannot be concluded that the Executive, upon emitting the disputed decree, that invade in any way the sphere of competences of the Congress, therefore is being provided in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws emitted by the Legislature, assured.

The same one 9 of November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state proxy to the constitutional reforms, every time that does not have the right of "to sanction them or to veto them".
It interviewed around the possibility of the "vote by vote", María of the Angels Llanderal exposed that thanks to the approval of the corresponding features on the part of the General Counsel of the IEM will be possible the execution of partial recounts and total of the voting on the part of the local electoral organ.
Of that form, the partial recount of votes, of one or more electoral packages, will be able to be given in the supposed that: the results of the minutes coincide not; not the minutes of scrutiny exist and computation in the expedient of the booth or do not in being able of the president of the same one; or, when errors exist or evident alterations of the minutes.
Besides, the total recount of the voting received in all the booths of the election will be able to be carried out when exist indication that the difference among the candidate presumed winner of the election of that treat and the one that have obtained the second place in the voting, is equal or smaller to a percentage point; whenever to the start of the session exist the espresso petition of the representative of the party And/or coalition that advanced to the second of the candidates indicated.

Wednesday will be formed the new Italian government
The it appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will be faced to a crisis that has placed to that country to the edge of the economic disaster
The it appointed Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government that will be faced to a crisis that has placed to Italy to the edge of the economic disaster and has placed in danger all the euro zone.
A communiqué of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Neapolitan, to confirm that can form a Government.
It is expected that present a composed cabinet mostly by technocrats, although is not clear when the job will take on the new executive.
Monti said that will present the president the result of its conversations with the political parties in its intent by forming a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to surpass this difficult phase", the former European commissioner said to journalists.
Monti did not he say of explicit form that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been surpassed.
The "framework is now well delineated", added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, much less of the normal thing, while Italy fights a financial and political crisis that has prompted the prices of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration directed by the former commissioner European Monti should approve a hard package of austerity required by the European leaders to recover it struck confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti so that hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian bonds BTP to 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were seen obliged to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian management Confindustria, the press told after being met with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy leave the situation of emergency.
The possibilities of success of Monti were seen prompted of considerable form by the endorsement of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, to whom the crisis obliged to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to have a good result", the press told Angelino Alfano, secretary of the party of moderate right.
The support of the PDL, the major party of Italy, is significant because up to now many of its members had opposed to the Government of technocratic majority that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti should have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts would be able to cause a new and devastating one attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure upon notifying that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti initiated Monday its consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youthful organizations and of women.
Will put an end to its Tuesday night meetings round.
Monti was named Sunday by Neapolitan, that has enabled an extremely fast transition in answer to the crisis.
After a brief one I breathe to ends of last week, when remained of course Berlusconi would resign, the prices of the Italian debt have returned now to critical levels among the uncertainty on if the new prime minister be successful.
Rescuing to Italy, with a public debt of 1,8 trillion euro, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euro zone.
Monti has said that its government should last to the next elections, predicted for 2013, despite the predictions generalized on that the politicians only will give time to apply the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in their cabinet, but the large parties insist that should be formed only by technicians, an indication of its objections before a process obliged by the financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that the mutual distrust and the disagreements entity the parties are complicating the intent to include you figure political.

Said figure reached it Friday previous in the party against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers that play in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the League Premier of England, they maintain to the year an intense activity in championships of league and domestic cup, and collisions of highly level in European cups as Champions League.
To the previous thing adds him itself the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifying rounds of the Eurocopa and the World one of soccer.
The Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, they possess an international close contact limited in a zone, like the Concacaf, that is respected that of lower level inside the FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is of the goalkeeper Íker Booths, who on Saturday previous before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalized the registration of the exportero Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international encounters.

Of the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umaña, they are the left winger Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After there, alone five they surpassed the 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain figure Gerard I Stung (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Of the national side, with less than 30 presences, they appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The remainder not itself about at 20 o'clock.
While Nacho Moreal alone has four play and Jordi Dawn two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar possesses alone one and Ólman steep Slopes and Edder Nelson do not yet they debut.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Village, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Towers with 27.

Quintet included the country in its tour of celebration of two decades of path
"To go to Costa Rica is a dream done reality"
In exclusive interview with Alive, the downward one Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, he said that the band is list to offer one of its better concerts next Sunday, in the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years of wait, but the band assures that for them will also be to become reality the dream to touch in the country.
Thus the bassist assured it and member founder, Jeff Ament, who spoke in exclusive with Alive, from Brazil, last week.
The group is found in the south american wing of its tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will do its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented in the National Stadium, from the 7:30 p. m., next to the band angelina The X and the national of The Robertas.
This is a statement of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in The Nation on the Internet.
For their costa rican followers, is a dream done reality that Pearl Jam be going to touch in Costa Rica, ¿they are conscious of what their fans they are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream done reality for us also.
This is barely our second time in South and Central America and up to now has been magnificent.
I have been in Costa Rica alone once and of holidays; is a so beautiful country and I believe that we are going to be able to remain us some days there.
So it touches us to carry our music there.
I am asked it because exists a species of devotion toward the band, the fans live with intensity the prior days.
What tell them its more fervent followers?
Thanks by remaining to our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to arrive at Costa Rica; thanks by to have expected so much and we regret that have us taken so much time in arriving to there.
Some people even already refers to its concert as the largest show of the year.
It adds that a little pressure to its visit?
Some of the shows larger than we have touched during the last 21 years they happened during the last pair of weeks.
We touch a pair of shows gigantic in Sao Paulo and we expect that that have us placed in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Truly, we are very anxious to touch there.
We love that country, charms us surfear and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the better of the world.
How it was that they discovered Costa Rica and their waves for surfear?
We have many friends that are surfeadores and I have a great friend that lives in Tamarind and the waves there are incredible.
My friends always went to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are large places for surfear; thus was how do we inform us, through people that loves the surfing.
Upon seeing the tour, they have come delivering shows enormous with many songs.
What have they planned for their presentation in Costa Rica?
As never we have touched there before, then we do not have any restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch a pair of songs of each album and to give them to our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
This why it is owed?
I believe that is partly because we have nine disks and we can touch more than 120 songs and to each one he they like different songs, so is difficult to choose which songs to touch each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that carry while of touch not, that maintains us focused and also maintains us surprised because recalls we the reasons by the ones that us liked those songs and that could have been forgot us.
That does that the show be more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that also returns it more interesting for the people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of path.
Upon looking at behind, ¿is difficult of believing everything that they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
In the first place, I believe that none of us I imagine itself that we would be in a great band of rock and to have done for more than 20 years does that seem like a dream.
We continue counting our blessings and touches us a lot that we can continue doing together music.
All we want us and charms us to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places from the world to the ones that always we wanted to go.
The things could not be better for us.
What signified for you the to have been splits fundamental of the rise of the grunge?
Has always been a honor to be part of that group of large bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice or Chains.
Is surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is somewhat rare.
Occasionally, a band of a city arises, but is a lot more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time of a same city.
We are proud and honest to be part of the group of Seattle.
Still we touch with some of them occasionally.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice or Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all they still and honors us to be part of that sound of Seattle that arose.
Also it is very strange that a band as that of you be maintained united and with the same members therefore time.
Yes, four of us we have we are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) united itself us 13 years ago, which, in and of itself, is a lot more time of the one that many bands last.
In the first place, I believe that all we are fortunate to be still with life and, in second, all we worry about the others.
All we are very nearby friends and, thanks to that, also musical avenues have been opened that give liberty to each one to experience.
We trust us the some to the other with the music of each one and could not be better.
The relation of you with the word fame has not been simple; nevertheless, thanks to their success, they have been able to do what quieran.
How do they find a balance?
To as we have gone growing, has been easier to find a balance.
We assure us that not to be too much of tour because is easy to fall in that play of the large multitudes and of the people that loves your music.
While one it recall that the people is there by the music, that recall you that you should respect the music and what brought it, without encapricharse by being famous and to be a rock one star, something that to none of us really interests him.
How recalls its another project Mother Love Bone?
I believe that we write very good songs and at the beginning was somewhat magnificent.
We were a band by almost three years and never we publish a disk until after to die Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because lasted so much and it more important is that still we are very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), that began in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think about the incredible person that Andy was and how caused laughed me, was always a pleasure to be going to work, reírnos, to speak of music and soccer and a lot more.
Was a human Being surprising and we miss him.
The national band The Robertas will be the responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
It is certain that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that therefore they chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that more we liked, so we are anxious to see what The Robertas can offer in alive and should be very entertained.
Why always they change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter in alive?
That it is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings it and I believe that does it with the first thing that occur him itself.
As bassist, which are its influences?
They are so many.
Inside the first that occur they are themselves me Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They are so many that would be able to speak all the afternoon on the bassists that I love.
How has it achieved Pearl Jam to maintain prominent the grunge in spite of be not already a fashion?
I believe that all of us always feel a little offline of the word grunge.
When I think about her, recalls me the bands that mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that arose at the same time, and, if there is importance now, I believe that is somewhat marvelous because is music that is worth while to listen and bands as Mudhoney are doing now better music than never.
At the beginning, its music had a darker content and now has returned more positive.
Why this change is owed?
It is interesting because I believe that there is a pair of songs in the new album that perhaps they seem lighter, but also there are songs, like The End or Just Breathe that very dark songs they qualify as although they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them me, I cried when I listened them and are deeply dark songs.
I believe that when you grow and there is some trauma in your life and is lost a relative or a friend, those things begin to influence your art and your music and those two songs, without doubt, they represent that for me.
Also, I believe that a happy person can be herself and even so to be able to do music that be dark.

The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of the 80, in full height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some lampoons of promotion of Collserola.
The pamphlet defined the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona metropolitan.
It is more, a comparison accompanied by itself, in figures, with the Central one Park new york.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park be situated again, in the imaginary one of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalonian capital of the few that themselves they are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as nature reserve impacts in this idea.
The reference no longer was head Office Park but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of the bear Yogi.
In these it was until, in September, the City Hall called a megacompetición composed for 16 contests for other so many entrances to Collserola.
A door sender to the idea of park, without doubt.
Or that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question leaves alone: Collserola, ¿park or mountain?
The contest, so much by its only organizing side as for which supposes of reflection on the city is the talking point among all the architects people from Barcelona.
It is almost already a recurrent theme to which to throw hand when two members of this old caste of chosen are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives foot, exactly, to one of the few coincidences among what three architects people from Barcelona they think, and university professors, that have been presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is opportune.
For Roldán, after being undertaken the coastal front "is done necessary" to debate on "the front of mountain", every time that the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, itself has not been carries out.
"It fits to leave from the base that the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among others things by its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", sentence the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" encloses a "trap léxica" : not one must think in them "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some zones where one must act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban development world, qualifies the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Derived dangers of it "uncertain that is nowadays to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80 and that had in the zone of the Fòrum "its song of the swan".
The first fear is the own delimitation of some borders on where can be built.
"To limit something is to set already the following step", that is to say, its I surpass.
"One must think in new urban development instruments, of planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to authentic disasters".
Tighter to the question, Mòdol thinks that, simplifying, the side vallesana of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by an only topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that already exists a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall in broken bag", although thanks the opportunity that the City Hall offers to its guild to intervene in this project "since the first moment".
And still more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that permits the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" on if is this technical profile the one that should head the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", aims) that have had that to create: "The architects we should be alone a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross contests have been called -says- in the sense mountain-sea, but not a longitudinal reading exists, that see and understand the area in its entirety".
It causes, at least in its case, that have opted by participating in the 16 contests.
Of another way, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door from to the side.
In its opinion, that yes, the City Hall should guarantee that the stripe immediately over the Round of Dalt should predict, in all its extension, a zone of equipment that performed a smooth transition between the city and the green thing.
Casino forgives to Jonás Larrazábal and will leave free
After 72 days of hold, the legal attorney of the Casino Network offered the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that continued him himself for presumed blackmail
After remaining 72 imprisoned days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will leave at liberty after the legal attorney of the Casino Network offered him the pardon before the Penal Second Court of District, that continues a process by blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack to the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Network, Sergio Gil Garcia, make public a series of photographs and videos in which presumedly Manuel Jonás required him the payment of an economic quota so that the City Hall regiomontano to permit the secret operation of the house of bets.
After the public accusation, the state Attorney's office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor panista and September 2 was person under arrest and established by 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Department 3 in Hereditary Crimes, was transferred to the House of Hold 1, located in the Old Neighborhood of the capital of the State.
In that place remained during the 49 following days upon dictating a second order of hold after the agent of the Public Department rejected the crimes of bribe and delinquency organized.
October 19 was transferred to the penal one of Cadereyta presumedly by blackmailing with a million and middle of pesos to the owners of the Casino Network; nevertheless, only remained some hours in the prison of medium security since existed threats of death in their against.
The authorities permitted him to continue the interned judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
October 25 rotated order of capture by the secretary of the Penal Second Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that to almost two months of inquiries were verified sufficient tests to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the collection of 1,5 million pesos to the representatives of the house of bets in exchange for permit the operation of the same one.
This Monday, the legal attorney of Casino Network, Víctor Aldo Garcia Gómez, responded before the judge José Luis Pecina to request the pardon for the brother of the royal mayor; for which in the next hours would be able to recover its liberty.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the Public Department adhering to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garcia Gómez if had been repaired the damage and who of the associates of the house of bets was the one that offered the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the expedient 197/2011 is offered the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and in the successive thing will not be able to be presented any claim around the process that continued him itself; besides that will not be required him repair of damage neither punishment.
After the audience to the legal attorney of the house of bets, near the 15:50 the immediate liberty was ordered of Larrazabal Breton.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify to Jonás that has been forgiven legally and its expedient will be filed.
Also it will notify it of the order of immediate liberty that emitted the judge.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where lost the life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven people more
The Office of the secretary of Communications and Transportations (SCT) reported that the results thrown on the accident where lost the life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Moorish, and seven people more, they indicate that the helicopter impacted in a direct way on the land in complete structural integrity, without the pilot could try a compulsory landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transportations, mentioned that before separating the airship, the pilot verified that the conditions of climate were the adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the land, the reels had contact with trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
Also it reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, for which included the necessary requests to transport to the personnel.
Besides, he said that in the done investigations in the zone of the impact not the apparition of pieces in the land is reported.
"In a search they are reported that there is not pieces or components of the ship in another place, the impact was presented of structural form.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, included adequate requests for trasportar to the passengers.
The land presents a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary assured that is a priority to include the before possible results; nevertheless, the investigation can last various months, even could reach a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Services you Help, assured that to the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Greater State operated in cruising speed and that this happened in an ascending soft land.
"This information fortifies the hypothesis of a normal operation of cruiser to the moment of the impact", expressed.
In the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, enumerated six prominent element in the investigation:
I fly visual:
According to the regulatory nature aeronatics the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew should have visibility during the flight and the land.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located adequate conditions to the takeoff, in agreement advances the airship toward the bordering area between the DF and the State of Mexico layers of cloudiness to low height were presented.
Routes selected:
It is probable that by the conditions of cloudiness the crew have sought a zone of smaller elevation and greater visibility toward the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last registration of the airship of the radar coincide, probably before the impact do not there was loss of control neither alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of remainders of the airship in a zone reduced:
The available information up to now they permit to suppose that the impact occurred in a sideways and straight path.
The remainders dispersion boss of the airship they permit to suppose that the helicopter impacted in the land in conditions of structural integrity.
Itself not evidence of fire has been detected or explosion:
In the place of the sinister one they continue without being revealed evidences in the remainders of the ship of some type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the land.
During the works of field pieces of the airship to an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet on the medium level of the sea have been found, the land presents a slope that goes since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which predictably was dismantled along said traveled through.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts in the land.
After the meticulous search in a more extensive zone than the place cordoned off, around the accident, itself not dispersed pieces of the airship have been found, what fortifies the presumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find gene of obesity
It directs the social security an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in children and young; is supported in specialists of the IPN
The Mexican Institute of the social security (IMSS) announced that directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in children and young, called protocol 'Genetic of the obesity of the infancy and the adolescence', that will permit to include associated scoreboards to the excess.
In a communiqué, the leader of the Unit of Medical Investigation in Biochemist of the Hospital of Specialties of the hospital National 21st century, Miguel Cross López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors was integrated, nurses, nutriólogos and social workers.
Said team is supported by specialists and students of graduate of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and of the Center of Investigation and of Studies Advanced (Cinvestav) of the National Technical Institute (IPN).
In the investigation is invited to participate to the population be or not rightful claimant, to respond to the units sports participants of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests to the smaller are carry out, every Saturday from the 8:00 hours.
It emphasized that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (Been of Mexico West) and that since October 8, the activity is carries out in the Sports Unit Nezahualcóyolt (Been of Mexico East).
Once comply the objective to meet to 500 or 600 smaller, the study will continue in the Unit Sports Independence (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Dwell them (to the north of the Federal District).
It explained that the purpose of this investigation is to know the components and the importance of the genetics with regard to the development of the obesity and to identify in children and Mexican youths factors of risk to prevent the apparition of degenerative chronic illnesses.
Upon being celebrated this 14 from November the World Day of the Diabetes, needed that the objective is to meet three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of its parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on diet.
Also he will be asked him on the preceding and physical activity heredofamiliares of illnesses, for the purpose of avoiding factors of risk that unchain sufferings as diabetes or kidney failure.
It detailed that Saturdays applies to all the participating measurements antropométricas (weight, size, circumference of waist), takes of arterial pressure, decision of the levels of glucose, triglicéridos, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (is sought to identify genes that associate to the childlike obesity).
Cross López indicated that this investigation obeys to the worry of the professionals of the health by the alarming increase of weight in the smaller.
'The surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in so alone six years there was an increment, in the case of the children, of 77 percent in obesity, and of the girls of 47 percent; in terms of excess also a dramatic ascent was observed', emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated that the justification for the search of the scoreboards is supported in which the population of the country differs of other by its genetic history.
It reported that on the average, the Mexican considers 65 hundred of inheritance Native American, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition he reflects in the genes that associate to diabetes and excess of weight.
It explained that in a general way, the genetics of the obesity is translated in the incapacity to burn the excess of energy that consume (calories) and that is stored in the shape of grease.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, what permits to detect if they present some degree of excess or obesity.
Even, he said, the dark color folds presence (acantosis) in neck and forearm, that indicate the probability that suffer metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled of confidential form, the doctors deliver it in writing the parents, to whom is explained them each one of the measurements and the changes in the way of life that should carry out to prevent illnesses.
Cross López explained that three main components exist that cause excess, obesity and other chronic sufferings: the sedentary lifestyle, that is the lack of daily physical activity, to remain most of the seated day set against the television set and to utilize media of transportation instead of walking short distances.
Also itself due to the high caloric consumption, that is to say, the major consumption of sweet beverages, of carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc) with high content in greases and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Blacksmith, investigator of the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, independently of the environmental conditions and of temperature
If the signs that sends the pavement to be attended, would not be necessary to repair near 200 thousand potholes each season of rains in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, notified Rafael Blacksmith Nájera, investigator of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of a pavement asfáltico is the adequate one, the potholes would be able to be reduced in quantity or, even, to be eliminated for Complete.
In its conference A technological opinion of the potholes, dictation in the framework of the International Year of the Chemistry, brought to light that the laboratory to its charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with a greater so much, mechanical resistance to high as to low temperatures.
Blacksmith Nájera reckoned that this type of asphalts modified they would be able to be utilized in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some north cities of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
It explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the petroleum, is a hydrocarbons molecules assembly, some of highly molecular weight, calls pave us, and other of low molecular weight, calls maltenos, that you join they give to the pavement their characteristic behavior viscoelástico.
The behavior viscoelástico of the asphalt consists of that to high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and to 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while to very low temperatures, the asphalt returns fragile, added.
The previous thing signifies that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but goes modifying during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, notified the specialist in chemical engineering.
The investigator of the FQ observed that the streets of Mexico City mostly are covers by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve to the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers the folder is found asfáltica, conformed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each one of the stones that constitutes the folder, aimed, is bathed with asphalt.
Upon traveling the vehicles and to be generated efforts, this permits that the forces be diffused very well in the pavement.
If it was a matter of asphalt modified they would be diffused still better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the folder asfáltica, abounded, a last layer is placed called folder of tread, which is made of a material of fine stone, that is to say, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is a matter of the layer that is going to be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, should have more forces mechanical that the folder asfáltica and to provide friction on the road.
Upon being the part of the pavement that is going to receive and to diffuse the efforts, the folder of tread requires, likewise, to have the adequate thickness and the material of the one should take care of itself that is done.
The climate, especially the humidity and the variations of temperature, also they are a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he said, because affects considerably the performance of the folder asfáltica.
When the land is dampened, the water is diffused in the interior of the folder and is difficult that leave, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of formation of a pothole, he said, the first one in being eroded is the movie of running and only later the folder is affected asfáltica, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be attended to the first signs with adequate programs of maintenance.
The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the traffic load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, because of it, the thickness of each one of the layers of the pavement should go always in relation to the traffic load and to guarantee that comply, to avoid that potholes be formed often.
Rafael Blacksmith notified that still there is a lot that to investigate and to work on the asphalt, for example, the emulsions asfálticas, that in other countries already they are found even in the market and they permit to repair the potholes with facility and without high need to use temperatures.
What lacked the candidate of the Valley to be the new young lady Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that impacted so that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Young lady Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princess.
Again the Valley of the Cauca remains with the desires of the crown of Young lady Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be complied with to be in the podium of winners, to light up the silver crown and the band that accredit it as new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic young lady was raised with the crown and the scepter, the department already he adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina themselves a to the legion of women vallecaucanas that have been near the crown but that they were you proclaim princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patrician Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Raise you (1983), Olga María Sands (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consoles Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many cause is ¿What lacked?
Because the result represents the rout of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had all to be the new Young lady Colombia, not in vain he was chosen Queen of the Police and Better Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens as Taliana steep Slopes or Natalia from Navarre who were carried the crown of Young lady Colombia.
The first factor that key in the decision is considered that took the First jury to appoint it Princess situates in which he did not convince with its answer to the question "¿Which is that book that has marked you to you and why? done by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Wagon we Read.
To the interrrogante the vallecaucana responded:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that is a form of culturalizarse, finally I believe that the book that marked me of infancy is" The princeling", is a quite deep book.
At present I read "Crime and punishment", is a book of universal literature that all we should read; and nowadays I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called "The ardor of the blood"".
An answer that little liked first by the term "culturalizarse" and second by explain not in a concrete way of what way each one of the books that cited they have marked it.
But upon finalizing the ceremony Melina declared to be felt tranquil and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all the people, please they read a little bit one, "The princeling" is a great book"
Among the hypothesis launched he is said that to Valley the favoritism he burned it.
A journalist of Bogota insinuated that upon being it preferred, it applauded and the candidate that was carried all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote of the public by the best craft suit, and Queen Mother), "that awoke the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine in the setting".
And that it was noted in its first presentation in bathing suit in the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation.
Although in both it lit up sure, was noted that the force lacked him and the impetus that the representatives of Mary magdalene and Atlantic yes they showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "As at home", of the Channel RCN thought that the fact that Melina to be appointed princess "verifies that the candidate that more prizes desire during the contest does not remain like the queen".
Besides, Valley was shown to the last thing very I avoid with the press, and there was mistaken.
Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince to the jury on its interest toward the social work, that is in last, the essence of the National Contest of Beauty.
By something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they sought a woman compromised with the social needs of its pies.
"The alone beauty does not suffice in a Miss Colombia, one must look at but there of the physical thing and to be centered in its social sensibility, that before entering to the Contest they be already involved in projects", explained.
Also it speculates that Valley sinned for its defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that him was noted in its abdomen, but turns out to be contradictory therefore exactly the jury chose it as the candidate 'natural Beauty' with the body healthiest, good diet and responsible physical work.
The coach of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for my was not very notorious, descended him points in the last day".
In the meantime the journalist Guido Pits, of the magazine Chromium considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgeries that was practiced.
"The surgeries are well, but Valley was not known them to do.
Their body never was its fort and here they charged themselves it".
By this prize, that for the first time delivers the National Contest of the Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit a cruel forecast arose that last night complied, therefore was told that this was the happy one that Raymundo granted to Melina for give him not the flavor of the crown.
Reality or not, the certain thing is that Melina from now on begins a year of reign, not as the sovereign, but like princess, position that offers the possibility to represent to Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the own National Contest.
Nevertheless, she will pass to the history as one of the queens that in spite of its devastating step by Cartagena, aloof the crown was him.
Thus it was the work of the caleño that identified the corpse of Alfonso Gray
A lofoscopista of Cali passed to the history as the man that confirmed the death of "Alfonso Gray".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4 a lofoscopista of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the man that confirmed the identity of the leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Gray", through the comparison of its fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas that labor in the sectional one of the CTI, that week touched the shift of "availability" to Eliazar González, a Roof Port man that carries 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
Upon initiating their career, González worked in municipalities of the Collided, where many times had to be gone for more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place in which were the corpses that should be identifying.
In the 2000 it was transferred to the capital of the Valley and, after carrying out the corresponding courses, specialized itself in lofoscopia, that is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say, of the palms of the hands and of the feet.
The week of the operating one against you ally Alfonso Gray to Eliazar they notified him that carried most minimum clothes for three days.
Somewhat large he expected him.
Friday in the night left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
It knew that should identify two corpses and that suspected that one of them was of the man that directed to the oldest guerrilla warfare of the world, for which they asked him that carried the card decadactilar of Guillermo Lion Sáenz (its true name).
Nevertheless, when it arrived with the team of investigation to the place in which the corpse was found did not recognize it for its physical aspect, therefore was very different to which had seen in the mass media.
Was without beard, dress like a peasant of the zone, without eyeglasses and a lot more thin.
But the tracks do not lie.
It accompanied by a magnifier galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the finger impressions of the corpse with those of the card.
Its eye did not fail him: was "Alfonso Gray".
That same night, the native man of Port Roof was the responsible for confirming him the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Finch, that yes was a matter of the leader of the Farc.
In search of the track
For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín of Cali the recognition that did the president Juan Manuel Holy to Eliazar González, in the press conference by the operating one against "Gray", he is very significant.
Many people does not he know our work.
The dactiloscopia is an exact science, without margin of error, that can come be key in the resolution of crimes.
Aside from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support investigations by crimes as theft and homicide and they confirm the identity of the people captured.
When they are captured, many delinquents present false decrees or do not have roles.
We take them the finger impression and we seek them in the database.
The investigator related that, in a case of theft, he touched him to remove a piece of wall of a house, therefore in that place the thief had supported his hand to remove a full strong box of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because are not appropriate surfaces to remove a finger impression, but in that case we could obtain the track of all the hand and to identify the delinquent, that had participated in different thefts", recalled.
The tracks can also rule out or to reaffirm suspects in cases of homicide.
It does little they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation was determined that a relative could be a suspect of the crime and, really, a track in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not it guarantee that have been the murderer, yes locates it in the scene of the crime.
A dactiloscopista of the CTI explained that in the objects "the tracks are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplantador is utilized or tape to raise them.
After this, the impressions are envoys to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the Registraduría.
"The problem is that still there are many Colombians lacking identity papers", indicated the expert of the CTI.
It clarified that not all is like is shown in the program of television CSI.
As well as everything that does not shine is gold, not everything that is touched returns track.
Nevertheless, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is carried out.
The "indignant" they challenge to authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded before the plaza Zuccotti to camp.
A great part attended the eviction order and was transferred to a paruqe nearby.
The members of the movement Occupies Wall Street challenged this Tuesday to the authorities of new York upon trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to the plaza of Manhattan of where they were ousted of early morning and upon trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded before the plaza Zuccotti, where they wanted to agree thanks to a court order that permits to the "indignant" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park more to the north of the city, where there has been new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not permit us to camp again in the plaza, we are going to install in some another place and we will continue the legal battle by returning to Zuccotti, as well as through seated and peaceful demonstrations", one of the spokesmen of the movement said "Occupies Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the answer of the "indignant" to the eviction of its dictated camp personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings emitted an order that prohibited the compulsory evacuation of the place and permitted the demonstrators to be maintained camped.
Besides, the "indignant" they proceeded to the occupation of a new park situated in the confluence of the central Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the tunnel Holland, that unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least during an hour they managed to occupy the place, but later the Police responded and he proceeded to stop to some of the demonstrators, although Bray he could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured to Efe that saw various journalists that were also shackled.
The organization assures that are various hundreds of people the ones that had been installed on that point, where already a delegation of religious leaders in sample of support has been displaced to the members of the movement and that tried to mediate with the Police.
In the meantime, the plaza Zuccotti -that is a precinct of private property- continues closed to the wait of the celebration of a predicted judicial view for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this early morning should be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators displaced persons to there they carried and they distributed at this hour you copy of that court order and even the agents delivered them that guarded the plaza, what caused "some small clashes", indicated Bray, who denounced that some officials gave blows to the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits to the authorities to oust to the members of Occupies Wall Street or to apply "laws that were published after began the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators to agree again to the park with stores or other properties that utilized previously".
The mayor Bloomberg indicated before the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, to the ones that alerted, nevertheless, that the local laws do not permit them to install again with tents and bags to sleep.
The manager defended personally the eviction carried out of early morning of the plaza Zuccotti, an operation in which proceeded to around 200 detentions and that was decided because the demonstrators were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the plaza because this was being converted "in a place in which the people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do damage to other people", since "some business had received threats" and the neighbors feared "by their quality of life".
"The eviction of this early morning was filthy and shows that in the fund Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that the of the American workers", added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "to lack the respect to the freedom of speech".
The responsible for "it Occupies Wall Street" they indicated also that think to organize "large actions" for Thursday in contribution with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests last, that began September 17.
Even Anderson will be the Virgin one María in a special Christmas one of television
Next to Michael Bublé and other noticeable Canadians, will appear in the program of television "It' s to Russell Peters Christmas" the next one 1 of December
The Canadian Even Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", rescue worker in "Baywatch", rabbit of "Playboy", the wife of the musician of rock Tommy Reads and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin one María in a special one of Christmas of the Canadian television.
The private channel of television CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad writer) Michael Bublé and other noticeable Canadians, will appear in the program of television "It' s to Russell Peters Christmas" the next one 1 of December giving life to a very Virgin individual María.
CTV distributed today images of the program of television in which Anderson, also known by the extensive distribution on the internet of a pornographic homemade video in which appears along with its then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Reads, dress appears like the Virgin one María maintaining in a manger a dummy that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a funny acquaintance Canadian of Indian origin that recently acted as the presenter in part of the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appears like José.
Besides Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas one of CTV counts on the Canadian singer Bublé, that to the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the model one Argentina Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "vixen" to the American one Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts in New York.
Japan reborns after the earthquake
The GDP grows a 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that initiated in March
Since the past month from March the Japanese economy was found paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that occurred in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe than suffered the Japanese country since the II World War.
The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo coded the material losses in 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have reduced.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the gross domestic product between July and September served to pass page, finally: the GDP was increased a 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and a 6% in rate annualized.
The registered one in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March of 2012 - supposes, besides, the major rhythm of growth since the period from January to March of 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the recovery of the purchase of machinery to restore the zones leveled by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the businesses enlarged its investments in a 1,1%, set against the descent of the 0.9% in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first backward movement after six months of uninterrupted ascents.
Nevertheless, the true enema of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively in the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or to reconstruct - the infrastructures, to be served of the lacks for grow from zero.
Japan has awoke, above all, thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, that currently represents the 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable scaled a 1%, pushed by the increase of the expense in vehicles, trips and activities of leisure.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "values refuge" chosen by the investors that flee the crisis of debt in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of United States, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products turn out to be more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic waterline comes determined by the health of the large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed its weak results between July and September to the quotation of the yen.
While the markets continue with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not low the guard.
"One must be attentive to the risks that persist, like the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen", indicated yesterday the secretary of state of Economic Politics, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the perspectives do not turn out to be encouraging.
The Organization for the Cooperation and the Economic Development (OCDE) needed that the majority of the member countries they presented in September clearer signs of economic slowing.
The indicator that anticipates the points of inflection in the world economy put of relief that the main powers are being braked.
Since descended four tenths to the 100.4 points, set against the 100.8 of August.
The euro zone, even, was situated under the average, that is found in the level 100, upon being precipitated eight tenths to the 99.13 points.
Athens feeds again the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will sign no commitment written
With the cousins of peripheral risk shot and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parquets, Greece continues entangling in the labyrinth that conducts toward the exit of the great crisis of European debt.
The sensation that the "consensus" of the new Greek transition government comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels that by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, notified yesterday that there is not alternative for the structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days agreed in its designation perhaps remain short to apply them, the leader of the party conservative New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that will support new measures of austerity in no case and reiterated its demand of new elections for the predicted date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summit of October 26", asserted Papadimos upon opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that tomorrow with a vote of confidence will culminate to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to prompt the employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of the officials and new measures against the tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras not clear the doubts on its position: "We have compromised to help the transition government, but us we have compromised to nothing more".
The conservative leader was a step further in its pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that should release the 8,000 million that Athens needs urgently, and clarified that will not give its seen good to any compliance commitment letter of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, escocida still by the impact caused by the órdago of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: will not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a commitment written without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman of Economic Matters, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will return "very quick" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed for pay the sixth section" of 8,000 million, although do neither there is final date.
The Greek hank still has thread for while.
Mrs Sofía: "Are instruments for the progress and the hope"
The Queen emphasizes the place "predominant" of Spain relating to this type of finances
Spain "has reached a predominant place on a worldwide basis in the role of the Microfinanzas".
The Queen Mrs Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become these two last decades in the donor second of the strike relating to this intrumento of cooperation, whose "essence" indicated that situates in being an "instrument for the social progress, the justice and the hope of a better future for all the humanity, based on the confidence in the human Being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of the Micro-credit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is not doubts" of that be type of operations they are "absolutely indispensable" to reach the Objectives of the Millennium established by United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in that that has as goal the reduction halfway of the volume of people that live with lower incomes to a to cut newspaper, with in The one that themselves fixed the "threshold of poverty".
Spain "continues working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all the corners of the planet, and assumes this task with" responsibility", indicated Mrs Sofía, that expected that the initiatives and contributions that be originated in the Summit, that will be prolonged to Thursday, "they guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and above all for the women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many achievements reached" and "many the challenges to the ones that we face us".
The Summit of the Micro-credit be planted not only as a forum of debate, but also like the platform since the one that to prompt "two basic goals".
Thus, Its Majesty explained that aspires to that by the end of 2015 they be 175 the millions of poor families that have agreed to these financial products and that a hundred million those homes leave the threshold of poverty in which they are plunged.
The impulse in the conception of the micro-credits in Spain and in the remainder of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago of pioneering form" by Muhammad Yunus, projection Mrs Sofía as an "act of justice and recognition owed".
And the fact is that described the father of this tool as an "idealistic admirable in the universal cause of the fight against the poverty", whose work knows since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the land her politics of loans.
To this experience they continued him a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other encounters as them celebrated in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to verify the continuous evolution", explained Its Majesty, whose link with this project was worth him yesterday the description of the "head of family" congregated in Valladolid on the part of the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, the Queen Mrs Sofía concluded its intervention encouraging to the presents to participate in the debate and in the search of solutions to advance in the fight against the poverty.
"Imperative ethical"
The minister of Exterior Matters, Trinity Jiménez, notified that the solidarity "is an imperative ethical one" for democratic every state.
In this sense, exposed that would be an error to link the cooperation with developing countries to epochs of economic prosperity, since is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that the micro-credits suppose "a rigorous and serious politics dedicated to eradicate the poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of countries developed should work low criteria of solidarity and not to leave that this be victim of the cuts.
For Spain, the micro-credit consists of "one of the main lines of cooperation to the development".
In turn, the International Cooperation State Secretary, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom all they close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Lion of it Review, welcomed to the presents to a city that "opens its doors infected of the supportive spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 of November, in Leipzig, has elapsed without large difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-democratic party.
Initially itself it had not been included in the order of business the future of Europe, but the theme was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy the militants that consider that the politics of the Government is at present too little strict with the Greeks and could be it in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the proposed, European Commission by the direction, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, so alone nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of various minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finances, they clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, itself summary in a motto: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not alone because Europe supposes the peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly of the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the hour to break has arrived through in Europe".
This would be able to be declared in modifications of the tried Lisbon to permit to reinforce the control of the European Union on the budget policies of the countries of the zone of the euro, although would also be able to flow into in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote for "to give him a face to Europe".
In every case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without doubt, turns out to be little probable that the twenty-seven arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is shown hostile before him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the land.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected for an overwhelming majority the proposal to praise the weight of each country of the board of directors of the European Central Bank in function of the weight of each economy, which evidently would reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxious by calming the spirits in the interior of its party, the Chancellor has enlarged the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is neither that have tried to be won to its congress at the cost of the "small" European countries or of the countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant one Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned to France.
Save of past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle was produced in Leipzig.
In fact, was one of the most humiliating routs for the army of Napoleon.
The incident of the fraud in the drops by illness
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government they undertake an offensive against the drops by illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 of November in Burgundy to visit a box responsible for the family subsidies and to deliver a speech on the theme, already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against the social fraud and the assistantship.
Besides, to accompany such offensive, that splits of the rigorous will to save of form, but even so recalls to an axis of the presidential campaign of right, the majority wants to be centered in the drops by illness.
In the first place, to apply spending cuts: the Government foresees to impose on the workers of the private sector a fourth day of lack before be able to catch the drop.
In final, unless a covenant of specific business exist, a worker that fall sick would lose four days of salary, that is to say, a minimum of the 15% of its monthly incomes.
It is a matter of a measure that would be able to raise a wave of ira, but that would permit to save 280 million euro, according to Them Echos.
Besides, it would go accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic reach: to impose on the officials a day of lack without remuneration in case of labor drop (up to now, they do not have lack, set against the three days that apply in the private sector).
While they debate these questions, the majority puts again on the table likewise the theme of the fraud, this time oriented toward the abuses of the labor drops.
"They are going to increase considerably the controls and, besides, if is discovered someone committing a fraud, should refund the amounts", notified Xavier Bertrand speaking in the RTL Sunday 13 of November.
Just like in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate for the reality of the fraud in matter of labor drops.
In fact, since 2002 a constant monitoring of this question is carried out and diverse political offensives have been launched that, normally, they have given fruit.
The French do not make ill more than in the remainder of Europe.
We observe with attention, in the first place, the national figures.
According to the French Institute of the social security (CNAM), in 2006 they were credited more than 237 million euro in benefits by labor drops.
According to the French Institute of investigation and documentation in economy of the health, the subsidies by the drops represented, in 2008, the 5% of the sanitary expense, elevating to 11,300 million euro.
Of this sum, the 46% corresponds to the drops by maternity and by industrial accidents, while the 54% is related to the drops by illness, figure that elevates to 6,200 million euro.
Consequently, the 2.5% of the expense in health.
In 2010, the French have caught an average of 14.5 days of labor drop, set against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Soul Consulting.
An average that, without doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management Monster.com, showed that the 75% of the 40,000 polled French wage earners they affirmed that they had not caught neither a single day of drop by illness.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the drops by illness they had a lower duration to 8 days, the 22% from among 8 and 14 days, the 15% from among 15 days and a month, the 15% from among one and three months and the 11% more they were prolonged.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, the French workers are not more prone than in other zones to catch drops by illness.
A long study carried out in 2010 for two investigators of the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence of the work (so much by reasons of health as of another type) oscillated, in France, between the 10% and the 11%, set against a 20% and a 28% in Denmark, a 15% in United Kingdom or between a 16% and a 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the drops by illness does not turn out to be especially significant in comparison with the work done not declare.
The fraud has an enough reach limited.
The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has caused that the controls of the drops by illness of more than 45 days be systematic.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in a 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that the drops of short term were "unwarranted or too long", that is to say, 37,050 cases.
In the case of the drops of more than 45 days, submitted to systematic inspections, was considered that the 11% of the cases they were "properly adapted or unwarranted; a figure that, having as parted a total of 1.2 million, elevates to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 cases is reached "unwarranted" among various millions of workers that caught a drop by illness.
Without doubt, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with the work in black.
According to the representative of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this question in June, practical happiness would represent some losses of fiscal incomes from among 9,000 and 15,000 million euro to the year, that is to say, more than the total price of the subsidies by drops and, without doubt, considerably more than the fraud in this last environment.
Papadémos: Greece should apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to straighten its economy.
This is what declared Monday 14 of November, the prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before to the Parliament; added likewise that the a hundred days that have been granted to their Government of union they would not suffice to reach such objective.
"To carry out efforts that carry to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European associates and a new program of budgetary adjustment", declared the Leader of the Government, that pronounced its first public speech during the inauguration of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament Wednesday.
The execution of the decisions adopted during the Summit of the zone of the euro October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "is in play" the continuance of the country in the zone of the euro, added.
Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the public deficit of the country will be reduced "until around the 9%" of the GDP before end of year, after reaching a 10.6% in 2010 and a 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new measures of austerity
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the group of right, showed Monday its support to the measures already approved to try to leave the crisis of the debt, but has notified that its party will not compromise with measures of additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures", affirmed during a meeting with the representatives of its party "New Democracy".
It indicated that was according to the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt, as well as of fight against the waste, but against any politics that impede the economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner of Monetary and Economic Matters, that notified that the IMF and the EU would not release the loan of 8,000 million necessary euro without a guarantee written of the support of all the parties to the measures predicted, Antonio Samaras has responded that its word would be sufficient and that would not sign anything on account of the external pressure.
A committee of experts affirms that they should be legalized the euthanasia and the suicide attended
The Canadians live denying the death, as indicates the report of the Real Company of Canada
In matter of mitigating cares, the committee demands that the governments, the institutions of health care and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the better mitigating cares, and not alone in the cases of cancer.
The Canadian company lives denying the death.
In fact, so alone 9% of the Canadians is willing to speak with their doctor on the conditions in which they desire to die and take dispositions to such effect.
It is a matter of one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Real Company of Canada, that included the participation of six experts of diverse environments, included the ethical one, the legal one and the doctor.
This committee recommends the Government that modify the penal Code so that be permitted the suicide attended and the euthanasia, when the patient be planted said option and has been judged competent to decide.
To begin, the experts cite a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth position, the study indicates that "the medicalización of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the people are afraid to treat the theme of the death".
With medicación or not, the 77% of the Canadians do not they have access to mitigating cares, as indicate the experts selected by the Real Company of Canada.
And, in spite of the fact that the majority of the Canadians desires to die at home, the 68.6% of them finishes passing away in the hospital.
As a group, the highest rate in this sense registers it Quebec, where a 86% of the deaths is produced in the hospital.
In the relating to the delicate theme of the euthanasia and of the suicide attended, the authors of the report arrived at some conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, that already has declared that does not desire to modify the penal Code in relation to the euthanasia and the suicide attended.
Nevertheless, according to the experts, that also they have studied the situation in all the countries where practical happinesses have been legalized or they do not constitute a penal crime, there is not any proof that the fact that they be not you considered a penal crime has not caused an abuse of their application, that is to say, the utilization of the euthanasia or of the suicide attended with not competent people or that they had not given Their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, coautora of the report, affirmed yesterday by teleconference that, to the contrary, excesses in those countries were observed more where themselves have not been legalized the euthanasia neither the suicide attended.
"In Canada the euthanasia is practiced, although is clearly illegal".
"In Canada the suicide attended is practiced, although is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians, favorable to the euthanasia
We recall that the 85% of the Canadians already they have been pronounced in favor of the euthanasia, since they think that would permit the people whose death be next to alleviate its suffering, as indicates a survey of Angus Reid carried out in 2010.
Besides, the 66% it believes that the fact to legalize the euthanasia will not give understand that the life of the elderly or disabled people has less value.
As for the people that have practiced the suicide attended, the 41% of the polled thinks that should not be initiated a process against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of the health care to a patient, the situation does not turn out to be so clear, they as indicate the authors of the report.
Besides, among its recommendations they suggest that be indicated in the penal Code that the withdrawal of the sanitary cares, if they have been rejected legally, does not suppose a penal crime.
The committee of experts asks likewise that be formed the sanitary professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejection the assistance in the end of its life without fear to be faced to an accusation.
In matter of mitigating cares, the committee demands that the governments, the institutions of health care and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the better mitigating cares, and not alone in the cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to the mitigating sedation or terminal, that already is utilized extensively in the sanitary institutions of Canada, the committee asks that, unless serve to reduce the physical pain, be considered like euthanasia and be submitted to the same procedures.
Other experts declare reserves
Other experts of the environment of the Right of health already have declared their reserves in relation to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Company of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in Right of the health, qualified as "extreme" the position of the experts that sign the report, among others things because itself not the practice of the euthanasia to the sick terminal is limited.
"This leaves the open door to a situation in which someone that be tired to live and have more than 18 years can ask aid to be killed", indicates Deschamps, that consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
The Mister Deschamps emphasizes likewise that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any another value of the company.
Now well, it adds that "in company, there are labels and limitations".
The specialist in Right of the health Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, that qualified as "manifesto in favor of the euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, that also belongs to the Real Company of Canada, puts in fabric of judgment especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where the euthanasia and the suicide attended they are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregón.

The Russian Minister of Exterior Matters, Serguei Lavrov, has judged yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arabian, while Chinese League urged Syria to apply the plan at the outset of the crisis, although did not declare its support to the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The chief future of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked something from time to the markets to form its team and to set in motion a program that will include "sacrifices" destined to recover the credibility loss during the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The old European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the unions and the management.
It should form a cabinet relatively restricted, composed by external technocrats to the Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of an extensive program with numerous sacrifices", affirmed Francesco Nucara, representative of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the encounters, after to have met with the President of the Counsel appointed.
In turn, the President of the Camera of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, has affirmed that expects that Mario Monti request before Friday a vote of confidence to the Parliament to guarantee that the new Government have sufficient support.
The consultations will finish with the presentation, on the part of the Mister Monti, of a list limited, without doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of state, Giorgio Neapolitan.
Monti has commented the agitation of the stock markets and of the bondholders yesterday, asking them time.
In the "democracy, there are some precise time limit" to form a Government and to prepare their program, emphasized, adding that is "sure that the markets be patient and they will understand it".
Its designation by the President initially obtained the consent of the markets, but later the anxiety was imposed, particularly after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in the zone of the euro in September.
The prime Minister appointed should create a team chiefly formed by technocrats, even if he has noticeable that he would like to include "political".
The new Government should function until 2013, date of the next legislatures, considers.
According to the President of the Camera of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.

A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be utilized with a nuclear weapon, as affirmed Monday an American NGO specialized in the atomic risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Agency of the Atomic Energy (AIEA) and in other documents emitted by said agency of the UN.
The AIEA declared last week its "serious worry" by a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS, being based extensively in documents of the AIEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked during three decades, since the years 1960, in a center nuclear Soviet soldier in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, would have abandoned the center to form a business centered in the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of their business would have carried to be put in contact, in 1995, with the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed that he cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA mentions that they exist "clear indications that Iran is developing" a system of nuclear detonation "with the aid of a foreign expert, that not alone knew well the technique, but also, has reported a member State to the Agency, worked during most of its career in said technology in the program nuclear soldier of its country of origin".

The crimes and crimes against the Moslems have enlarged near a 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of religious and racial violence have diminished or enlarged alone slightly, as indicate the statistics published by the FBI Monday.

Said legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the acts of violence linked to the race, the color of the skin, the religion, the origin and, now, the sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and seems more to Facebook
The place of microblogging Twitter modified Monday the presentation of its platform to permit its users, particularly, to observe the activity of the people to the ones that continue, which causes that its service seem a little more to that of Facebook.
A new eyelash "activity" and another call "name" they permit to continue more legibly and in direct the activity of other "Twittos", that is to say, of those internet users whose messages ("tweets") continues on the Internet or that they continue you.
This permits to know if they give monitoring to messages, if they are credited to new accounts, if they qualify as favorite some message, etc.
This new formula of Twitter was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before diffusing it to the remainder of the network Monday, has indicated to the AFP the spokesman of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, that was known by its instinctive little operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message of another person, followfriday pour recommander of suivre an autre utilisateur) faisant him bonheur give initiés, s' ouvre ainsi to a public bonus loosen avec a maniement comparable bonus to celui give réseaux grand public Facebook or Google +.
In the network, the users have debated to blow of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, turns out to be invasive and too much seems to Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The function Activity is going to help me to continue better some elements of my flow Twitter", writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" budgetary in the Constitution
The Government of great social democratic/christian democrat coalition that is in the power in Austria has determined Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budgetary to reduce the public deficit and, thus, to avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria on the part of the agencies of credit qualification (triple TO).
It was the own social democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Cabinet, when the Austrian public debt reaches the 74,6%, a figure very over the maximum limit of the 60% set by the tried Maastricht, but clearly lower to the debts of countries as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the reliability of Austria in a single level was reduced, of AAA to AA +, we would have that to pay 3,000 million euro more in interests each year", indicated the christian democrat Vice-chancellor of Exterior Matters, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds thus to a petition of the Summit from Brussels to the member countries of the zone of the euro of last October 26: in her, the Heads of state and of Government they asked the inclusion, before ends of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and of the recovery of the equilibrium of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the "model German", since Germany was the first European country that adopted that type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should diminish each year in a 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, from the 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not surpass each year the 0.35% of the GDP, while the regional States, as well as the comunas, they should present stable budgets.
The objective consists of that, toward 2020/2021, the public debt be reduced under the criterion of the 60% set by the tried Maastricht.
A strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention of the market of change
The Japanese prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, notified Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again the marked of the change if the yen continued enlarging.
"We will intervene, just as we did it the last time, if we verify that an excessive volatility is produced" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Noda to the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen elevated until reaching some next levels to the historic maximums that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold en masse yens by dollars to descend the value of the Japanese currency, that had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the American currency.
But the yen has gone mending gradually since then, prompted by the purchases of investors that consider it a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic slowing and of crisis of debt in Europe.
The dollar to be quoted again Tuesday to less than 77 yens and the euro has descended under the symbolic bar of 105 yens, reaching some next levels to the ones that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted to around 120 yens and the euro at more than 160 yens.
This explosion of the Japanese currency damages to the exports of the archipelago, since recommends the products Made or Japan and reduces the value of the incomes obtained abroad by the Japanese businesses when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is fighting for being reconstructed" after the earthquake and the tsunami of March 11, that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeastern), emphasized Noda, that is afraid that the increase of the root cut yen the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered the growth in the third quarter (a 1.5% in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase of the exports and of the consumption of the homes affected by the catastrophe.
But the prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finances, Jun Azumi, has asked to the Bank of Japan (Boxwood), that inaugurated Tuesday a meeting of two days of its Counsel of monetary policies, that adopt all the possible measures to weaken the yen.
Nevertheless, the enclosed Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, notified that the Boxwood already had taken "the adequate measures", giving understand that should not be expected a greater flexibility monetary Wednesday.
During its last meeting to the end of October, the institute of emission enlarged in five trillion yens (47,000 million euro) its purchases of Treasury Bills, carrying to the 55 trillion yens (519,000 million euro) the threshold of the funds that dedicates to the acquisition of diverse financial titles to flood the market of liquidity.
Zone of the euro:
the types grow, the markets flag
The risk of contagion of the crisis of the debt continues damaging to the European indices.
In spite of the Government of new Leaders appointment in Greece and Italy, as well as of some better figures of growth in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries continue enlarging.
Still they worried about the stability of the stability of the zone of the euro, the European markets sink a little more in the negative zone Tuesday 15 of November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 loses a 1.4% and is situated to 3,064 points.
The Dax loses in Frankfurt a 0.4% and in London a 0,1%.
"Keeping in mind the new tensions in relation to the performances of the loans of the States of the zone of the most affected euro, the stock markets of the entire world continue yielding part of their recent profits".
"The investors, nervous, they are perfectly conscious of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, institutional runner in IG Markets, cited by the agency Reuters.
The Market of Tokyo has closed with a fall of 0,7%, renewing the worries of the administrators of the market in relation to the capacity of Europe of containing the crisis of the debt.
"Japan, like the remainder of the world, has the fixed look in Europe and the exchanges will continue being carried out in a margin of variations reduced, so that the investors will not have proof that the situation has been stabilized", considers Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of the worries by the future of the zone of the euro affects to the single currency, that continues descending Tuesday.
The euro continues in its lowest level since a month ago and medium.
Toward the 10 hours, the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, a fall of the 0,4%.
According to the runners, has lost value after the party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, that met Monday in the Congress, adopted a motion that foresees, particularly, the option that a country in difficulties you left of the zone of the euro without abandoning the European Union.
The Italian types and Spaniards surpass amply the 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain to some very worrying levels.
Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations to 10 years reached the 6,85%, while the Spanish titles to the same time limit offered a 6,2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, although also of France, they continue feeding the fears of the administrators.
The leader of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, that runs the risk to be suffocated with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek prime Minister Lucas Papademos, in turn has affirmed that the application of the decisions adopted in the Summit of the zone of the euro October 27 would be the "main work" of its Government.
Spain is found in the aim of the markets, while Sunday the legislative elections will be celebrated there.
The difference of the types ("spread") among the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain, has reached a new historic maximum.
To the wait of the figures of growth of the zone of the euro
Since the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of the 0.4% in the third quarter, that is to say, a more favorable figure than the 0.3% predicted, prompted by the domestic consumption.
The Insee, nevertheless, has revised downward the figure of the second quarter, with a reduction from the 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
Besides, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries the economists.
Germany, in turn, has registered a growth of the 0.5% in the same period.
Itself prevén the first forecasts for the assembly of the zone of the euro at 11 o'clock, after the European Commission have notified on the risk of a new recession.
Energy policies:
the facts should be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a theme that itself cannot treat keeping in mind considerations of short time limit or simply thinking about the emotions, is the energy policies.
The availability and the price of the electricity influence directly in the purchasing power and in the competitiveness of the businesses.
Turns out to be adequate that an electoral encounter be the moment to reflect on such questions and on the place of the nuclear energy.
The debate only will turn out to be useful if studies the assembly of the environmental, social, and economic consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion in objective facts, in rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people in the planet, the demographic evolution will suppose the duplication of the electric demand before 2050, unless be deprived to an enormous part of the world population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be that to alleviate the shortage each greater time of the resources fossils to continue producing electricity continuously, without forget the imperious need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases for fight against the climatic change, a theme that has disappeared of the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima modifies none of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce the nuclear energy.
That it is not the case neither of Belgium, that submits his to the need to find a capable source to substitute it, neither of Switzerland, that only considers objective to build head offices of the latest generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, south Africa, Chinese, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, they continue ahead with decision with their projects.
The United States, by their side, after Fukushima they decided to add a unit to their park, taking up again the construction of a head office interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on the renewable energies, is presented from time to time as an example, the reality goes against such speech.
The election of Berlin is going to suppose an increase of the price of the electricity, a greater energy dependence by the need increased of gas imported, particularly of Russia, an increase of the emissions of CO2 by the gas head offices construction and of coal.
In some months, the damaging effects will be noted.
He should be meditated on the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the Aeolian sector, of which obtains the 30% of their electricity, is also one of the large users of coal and of gas due to the intermittence of the wind; by this reason, its emissions of CO2 and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and a 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policies, our neighbors credit a bill of electricity a 40% superior to that of the French homes.
While in an economy globalized the price of the energy constitutes a key factor of the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, the French businesses are benefited of the cheapest electricity of Europe.
By that reason, any significant reduction of the nuclear energy would suppose a strong ascent of the price of the electricity, what would reduce realism to the marvelous statements on the restructuring of industry of our country and the defense of ours purchasing power.
It is a matter of a price that the great majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not declare opposition by principle to that type of energy, they as show the surveys.
We recall that the energy policies of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively it oriented to the export, covers a galaxy of pymes they specialized in the international markets and that can create jobs not deslocalizables.
If France to decide to abandon the nuclear energy, would suppose the sacrifice of great part of those PYME and the loss of the 6,000 million annual euro in French exports of equipment and nuclear services.
What electrician would entrust an EPR designed to function sixty years, when is predicted the cave-in of its manufacturer?
To solve the equation of the nuclear energy, one must admit that not a miraculous source of production of electricity exists, just like neither a diabolic source exists.
The development on the part of Areva of solutions with low emissions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary character of the sources of energy.
In the case of the nuclear energy, turns out to be indispensable to maintain the maximum level of security.
In France, we have an Authority of security that exercises a so much transparent and strict control on the existing head offices as on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, they are also obsessed by the security.
In half century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
So alone one, that of Three Mile Island, was produced in some normal operating conditions; did not cause consequences neither for the people neither for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident itself due to the design of the reactor and to some inexcusable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident themselves due to two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented reach, that caused the death of scores of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn of this accident, just as did it of the two previous.
Thanks to these progresses and to a cooperation among the authorities of security, and the users and German and French builders, the EPR presents a capable design to resist to such phenomena.
While all the they study it electric actors that desire to build a head office, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since clearance would leave them to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It turns out to be indispensable and legitimate to seek the better energy options for our country, but would be irresponsible to leave that the emotion, the dogmas and the partisan maneuvers dominated a so important debate for the social, economic situation and financier of our country.
The immigration, ¿a load or an opportunity for the economy?
The politics of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized leaving since diverse points of view: the saturation of the administrative, judicial, and police services submitted to the politics of figures, the compatibility of this politics with the self-proclaimed statute of "country of the human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of the foreign students the one that has jumped the holders, with the Minister of Interior (see the periodic one Libération of May 23) proclaiming of past that France "does not need working, foreign talents neither waiters".
Nevertheless, rare time is analyzed since the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this theme, there is enough consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that counts on near two million immigrant workers", while in the left, the tone set it Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot be takes charge of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, so much the left as the right they shared the fear to the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
To both sides, is considered that the immigrants are a load for the economy and the French company.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the one that act with regard to the immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the codesarrollo will permit to solve the "problem of the migration".
This idea of the immigration as a load, a problem, perhaps turns out to be profitable electorally, but economically leaves very expensive.
Just as they indicate the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that summarizes the most recent know-how on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Defines Our Future, May of 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), an extensive consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth exists, the salaries and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of the immigration weakens the growth and damages to the employment.
The fears related to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these they can replace the national workers, particularly to the little qualified, pressuring so that its salaries be reduced.
But the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more well complementary than replacements of the national workers and exercise chiefly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
The immigrants little qualified work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where the formation does not satisfy the demand of personnel.
A positive effect on the salaries
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country that have lack of anesthetists, the complementariedad between national and immigrants he causes that the arrival of these last he influence positively in the salaries and the employment of the national.
Keeping in mind the previous thing, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of the 1% of the migratory flows supposes an ascent of the long-term real salaries from among a 0.6 and a 0,9%.
And, without keep in mind the fact that the diversity that contribute the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economic growth (a great proportion of American Nobel prizes exists naturalized and businesses as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The immigrants are also net taxpayers to the social systems, since they contribute of average a 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The International Organization of the Work calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant that arrive with an age of 30 years will carry out a net contribution (incomes less expenses) of 150,000 euro to the public budgets of average during all his life.
At the beginning of their mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to be going to seek the points of growth that lacked him "with the teeth".
Said teeth, that dissuaded the immigrants, they had exactly the inverse effect.
Europe invented the democracy, alone lacks him to think about a European democracy
The democracy is a well precious, but also fragile.
The European continent would should to be able to be agreed of it since, although was invented in Athens does more than two thousand years, along the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps they believed that, so that the democracy succeeded finally on its enemies, would be sufficient to exercise the vote and of the way more direct possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Small one", that was a matter of something thought.
The universal vote, although is a matter of a necessary condition for the democracy, is not sufficient in and of itself and even can become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher said old Etienne Vacherot.
Not, the democracy requires a lot more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis that live in Europe is an economic crisis, but is on the verge of being become a crisis political and democratic.
The recantation of the true-false Greek referendum had, to this respect, a double revealing effect: showed the need of a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sensation of its impossibility, of its inconsistency.
It should be reflected on this ambivalence to surpass it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle at present have been displaced and that, in many cases, the republican soldiers no longer advance in the good sense.
We will not come out ahead if we require a succession of national referenda, organized in function of the needs and of disorderly form.
A blank firm to the absolute European monarch or a high one in a vacuum of the nationalist hole: What options for the citizen!
Not, do not we want to remove blows of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, tranquil and continuous, of the options and the democracy, this time to European scale.
There is not crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because alone there is a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The totality of Europe is the one that fold to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of qualification, that the one that suffers its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
Is the assembly from Europe the one that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but is every Europe the one that loses slowly the sovereignty and, with her, each one of its nations.
It more urgent is that the popular sovereignty recover the rudder of the European project.
Because only together they will be able the Europeans to reduce the weight of their debts, to be freed of the markets and to prepare their future by means of the investments.
The exit of the crisis will require decisions to European scale that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, unless be to conduct us to the disaster.
After it to have fought for a long time against this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone asks currently a gobernanza economic European.
That thus be.
But to think about her without a greater democratic and political integration, and without being lived like such by the citizens, would be a new insanity and would carry us to a new break-even point.
We should assume a new phase of the European construction.
To build the Republic in France, was precise "to do" republican.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be sufficient.
This lesson continues being applicable.
We should build an Europe more integrated since the economic point of view.
Only it will be able to manage to building an Europe more democratic in the political plan, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, we do Europeans.
The cards with chip "without contact" are generalized
The world parlor of the cards of chip is initiated Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, the year 2011 should finalize with an increase of the 11% in the world sales of cards with microprocessors (banking cards, telephones with cards SIM, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations of the cabinet Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is that of the technology without contact, that permits to credit the transportation in common or the purchases simply approaching the card to a reader.
This year 460 million cards with chip without contact will be sold everywhere, ¡320 million more than the previous year!
Its quota should continue enlarging in 2012 (itself prevén 580 million units) and to represent near a 10% of the world market of the cards with chip (6.925 million cards).
Europe, that carries a lot of left behind time with regard to the region of Asia-Peaceful, is gaining ground in the sector of the payment without contact.
Around 26 million cards banking Visa already they have this function, that is accepted in 75,000 terminals of payment.
In France, its starts are more modest: are being utilized 400,000 Visas cards without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has emitted this year 2.5 million cards Pass Mastercard without contact.
To put the upper march, nevertheless, is necessary that the banks put them at the disposal of its clients.
"There are two large French establishments that have compromised to diffuse systematically in the future, among its clients, gifted banking cards of the system without contact", announces Gérard Nébouy, general director of Visa Europe France.
The banks test the by telephone mobile payment
But so alone it constitutes a first phase toward the middle of payment of the future: the mobile telephone.
Currently, few devices equipped with the technology exist NFC (Near Field Communication), indispensable to carry out the transactions.
"They are being delayed".
"But it would owe at last to experience a true boom next year".
"We predict that they will be sold between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 everywhere", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and the next one June in they Fall.
The iPhone will be equipped of around 200 clients and collaborators with a case that permits the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société générale has also affirmed yesterday that is preparing the commercialization of an offering that permit its clients to pay without contact through its mobile one.
Of the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris worries about the links among al-qaeda in the Maghreb Islamic and the sect Boko Haram.
The links among the group terrorist al-qaeda in the Maghreb Islamic (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on the ones that he suspected themselves since time ago, they have been confirmed.
Sunday, the algerian vice Minister of Exterior Matters, Abdelkader Messahel, even affirmed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that they are cooperating", explained, without contributing more details.
Paris seems to arrive at a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the abduction of two French in Niger the past January would have resumed the runways.
They abducted in a restaurant of Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine of Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with various of its abductors during an operation thrown by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, the Nigerian and French investigators discovered various telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls carried out indicates toward various speakers based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers grasped especially the interest of the investigators: one conducts to a Nigerian one that remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a north city of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man that, supposedly, is close to Aqmi and to the sect.
"It is a matter of a progress, but without doubt we should wait for to possess more formal tests before speaking of operating cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But is possible".
"We know since years ago that the sect enjoys financial support and exterior intellectual and that each time is more active", affirms Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
These last months, you said "supports" had turned out increasingly more evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operating ways, that now they imply the utilization of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly more complex and of the same style that them used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning by Washington, is since then pressuring to Abuya so that keep in mind the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, they carry time considering to the group as a community of worthy little visionaries of interest.
A fast success
It founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and to the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (that signifies, in hausa, "the western education is a sin"), incites to the establishment of an in the north Moslem Islamic emirate of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a fast success.
It is politicized and requires a strict respect of the sharia, while their militants they are launched to the fight against the impious central government.
These last they are oriented in the first place to the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were especially assets and they multiplied the attacks against the precincts.
The reaction of Abuya was, as is used to passing, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead were registered.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and abandons its north feuds.
Them you passed Christmas time, claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram attacks again against Abuya, particularly against the general headquarters protected of the police, with a suicide bombing, the first one of this type.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first objective international.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, that would cover from Mauritania to Somalia passing by Nigeria, restless to all the specialists of the security.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram arises like a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with the President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has notified him against Boko Haram and has affirmed that was willing "to share all the information".
The world according to the republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simple-mindedness and lack of know-how.
An America weakened by the crisis, ¿can negotiate a complex world with simple ideas or, even, simplistas?
Listening to the republican candidates for the presidential, the voters would be able to think that thus is.
Since some days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates each time do more resounding statements and shortcuts in matter of foreign politics, traditionally a strong point of the republicans.
They extend the mottoes, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the better candidate situated in the career toward the designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to carry the Chinese before the OMC and to denounce them "by handling of its currency", a key theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector toward Asia.
It gives equal if that implies the explosion of a trade war, affirmed.
Jon Huntsman, old Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate that possesses a sophisticated vision of the foreign policy, almost drowns before an attitude that "crushes" the emotions.
It has asked a dialogue sign, but constructive, with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, that remains stagnant in the depths of the polls, continues being inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear program.
"If I leave chosen, I will stop to Iran", boasted.
"If Obama leaves reelected, they will have the bomb".
It promised likewise to enlarge the military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of to have failed with its obligations in relation to that associate.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second better candidate classified, sample in turn a shameful ignorance of such themes.
Recently, it urged to counteract to the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that Chinese already has the military atom since 1964.
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, that supports to Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, in turn, is willing to unfold the American army in Mexico to fight against the cartels of the drug.
The resource to the torture against the supposed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also it preconizan Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan had also simple ideas and that won the Cold War.
They recall that the own Obama was a fan and that had to loosen the piston in matter of fight against the terrorism.
They insist, with reason, in the failure of their ingenuous dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit of the "boys" of Iraq and in their prevarications in Libya, and they labeled it of weak.
But the attacks do not turn out to be simple them.
The population judges of a more well positive way the balance of national security of Obama, that to put an end to Bin Laden.
From Iraq, distrusts of the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that does lack to reconstruct economically America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the more just impression of being.
The Nord Stream, new door of entrance of the Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, that communicates directly Europe western with Russia passing for the Baltic bottom of the sea, already has itself placed in service.
It should supply gas to satisfy the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian giant of the gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, included four Heads of state and of Government, they participated on the banks of the Baltic one, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime Minister François Fillon and their counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, they have rotated together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entrance of Russian gas in the network of Europe western.
With this new gas pipeline, each year 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas to Europe western through a first one will arrive had of 1,224 km that communicate the region of San Petersburgo with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania.
A second pipe should be concluded by the end of 2012 that will permit to supply a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is to say, sufficient to cover all the French consumption.
Besides, already it is spoken of the possibility to build a third pipe by the same one traveled through.
For Gazprom, the finalización to time of this enormous work presents air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had opposed firmly to the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream is going to permit to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the terrestrial course by third parties countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Of blow, these two countries lose something of its power: for them, will be more difficult to influence in Russia threatening to close him the access to the markets of Europe western.
In the climactic point of the debate, Warsaw did not doubt in comparing the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say, if the theme is politically delicate.
Europe western, supporting the Russian project, has obtained a greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy, given that the project has generated a gap between the Europeans of the east and of the west.
Russia has known, in so alone five years, to cause to succeed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the countries western rich, large consumers of gas and with some reserves each more limited time.
"This gas pipeline constitutes a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organic form", confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the gas pipeline, showing up to what point the large contracts of the sector of the gas are as political as economic.
All this explains the extensive smiles in the faces of the executives of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, in the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline also supposes a technical achievement.
The underwater pipe is manufactured of steel covered of cement to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It is supported in the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 m of depth.
Build it, was necessary to avoid fields of mines that date from World War Two.
"It was necessary to withdraw or to destroy about a hundred them, by precaution", indicates Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream.
Likewise, turned out to be necessary to maximize the measures of protection of the fauna and the flora.
The pipe is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 towers Eiffel and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, neither by stations of maintenance.
It was predicted a platform of control in the water of Sweden, but the responsible for the project they renounced the same one upon seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to permit that a Russian state company be to established of permanent form in the sea set against their coasts.
"In case of damage, we will interrupt the step of the gas in less than one minute", I need Jens Müller.
In case of leak, the gas of the gas pipeline will free, therefore, to the atmosphere.
But the builders consider little probable that a leak be produced, since have predicted junctures that, according to the forecasts, they will have a leak each 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by means of an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, that carries out exterior inspections, as well as by means of a device that circulates for the interior of the gas pipeline.
With the form of a pure one, is introduced in the interior of the pipe, that possesses a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
To its arrival, after three complete days of trip to a velocity of three meters by second, supplies precise data on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to function for fifty years without repair any type need.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning is of 200 bars and, on the way out of 100 bars.
Five businesses have united their forces to be able to carry out this project.
The business leader is Gazprom, that possesses the 51% of the participations.
To her, united the Germans AND.ON and BASF (15.5% each one), as well as the Dutch one Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each one).
These five companies have created a common business, call Nord Stream, responsible for building and to exploit the gas pipeline.
Has its headquarters in Zoug, Swiss, where the imposition turns out to be especially favorable.
Later, Gazprom rented to said company, during a time limit of twenty-five renewable years, the totality of the gas transportation capacities.
"To Gazprom will pay him for the total capacity, independently of the quantity of gas that really himself transportation", I need Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried I finish in a 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in a 70% by means of bank loans.
The total price of the work should reach 7,400 million euro for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached the 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that they will not surpass its investment, since Gazprom assumes in and of itself the risk of the expenses.
The gas pipeline emerges of the Baltic one in Lubmin, in a sandy coast planted of pines.
Some valves, with 4.5 meters of height, they form the door at the outset of the gas.
Some sensors exist that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas to the arrival, before be transfered to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas each hour.
To total capacity, they will be three million for hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a notebook of mark.
It created does half century by an Italian business, Moleskine wants to return to the people the flavor by the writing.
Has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in light of a candle.
The notebook Moleskine is recognized easily, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its leaves of broken white color, as aged by the time.
Nevertheless, the notebooks Moleskine with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The business Italian Way Way, based on Milan, decided at that time to launch to the market a design notes notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, by that then consultant of the business, took charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired in an old technique of production, the mass skin (skin of mole), that refers to a cotton varnished that was utilized, among others things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook very was valued by the writers and the travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current flavor an old object and forgot, an icon of the modernist artists to the 20th century", account Maria Sebregondi, that since then became head of the mark in Way Way.
And it reached the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26%, until reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away it has remained the confidential production of the first years, in which alone 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to United States.
It turns out to be difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook of notes attracts so much businessmen as to students and professional.
Just like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, of cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian business, that included twelve workers in its starts, now possesses near 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: an in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, since the Fnac to the small commerce of the center of the cities, and has known to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and to the need to write, in spite of the boom of the e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes of the hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has launched the exposition "Detour" where architects or artists expose its own notebook.
In August, launched likewise a notebook with covers of leopard, because of the film Festival of Locarno.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural breeze, Moleskine has known to diversify its products: bags, agendas, ballpoint pens, cases of computer... The mark covers an extensive range of backups.
A success that causes envy: in autumn of 2006, Way Way was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, being written thus a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate of the disabled workers continues being so high?
Around the 19% of the disabled people they are seeking an employment.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
In spite of a resolved public politics, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled people duplicates the average rate: a 19%, set against the 9% for the assembly of the population.
Discouraging?
"Not", it affirms Éric Blanchet, general director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progresses reached since fifteen years ago are considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two times but three higher times than the average.
"Nevertheless, still it remains a lot by doing".
It fits to mention that the unemployed disabled they continue being faced to numerous obstacles to agree to the employment.
They are used to having a more advanced age: the 37% has more than 50 years (a 17% of average).
They possess a level of cualificación little high: the 80% has not finished the degree and, of the 2.3 million students in the higher education, so alone 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is very extended among them: the 53% for the disabled, set against the 38% of average.
That is to say, numerous questions exist that complicate especially the return to the labor world and that "they constitute the gist of the problem", indicates Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the businesses to hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Besides, they exist those that itself they are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too much slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for it I Cited indicated that the polled directors have "a level of know-how on the low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of the people in wheelchair, deficient physical or intellectual".
The result: the private enterprises with more than 20 workers are very far from the objective to hire a 6% of objective, disabled workers that noticed a law of... 1987.
According to the last available figures, that date from 2008, they reach a relation of the 2,6%.
"Now we reach around the 3%", indicates Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of the businesses that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "submitted to this contribution", just like the amounts disbursed, they have diminished between 2007 and 2011, passing from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The law of 2005, that enlarged the contributions, has generated a great pressure for the businesses", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true consciousness raising, particularly among the large groups".
According to the Department of Labor, so alone the 59% of the companies that possess between 20 and 49 workers counts on disabled employees in its staff, set against the 82% of the businesses from among 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A happiness"
On the verge of being faced to the Bleus Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not they hide the pleasure that this friendly game generates them.
Us we will not dare say that connivance was noted among them, but the image is symbolic.
Seated one next to the other, in the platform of the audience of the Stade of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really they have done the peaces.
Five months after the gesture of grudge of its forward one against Turkey, the Belgian coach does not have more than compliments for him.
"I was happy a lot by Eden, by its progresses and because be Belgian".
"I want to advance", the forward one responds him of Lille.
As for the contrast among its presentations in its team and in the selection, "is an assembly", has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all the year, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to situate me".
It called to play against Romania Friday night, keeping in mind this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for, at last, "to shine".
Without forgetting us of the "pleasure".
It carries encouraging to the Bleus since was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"Always I have been its fan", affirms.
Without doubt, that is going to reinforce especially the character "private" of the encounter.
Especially because it will be faced "to Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", recalls.
"We have just faced does little.
"To play against them is always a happiness."
With simplicity, Leekens has done in turn reference to the "pride".
"Pride" by disputing "a party of gala".
"Pride" also by verifying, as "neighboring", that France "is again a team of very high level", near a year after the traumatism of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable work", said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share airplane with the Bleus toward... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing", emphasized.
"We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"They will be able to see it in the next parties". It included the party against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento confronts a great optimism to the return game against Bosnia (22h00), that will be celebrated Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the away game, they lacked realism to both teams.
"When they elapse these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already he is seen in Poland and in Ukraine.
Does not it have any doubt; the Selecçao, that directs from September of 2010, is going to qualify for the Eurocopa of 2012.
Really, so alone 90 minutes separate to Portugal of the happiness.
But there is a party that to play and a rival one, Bosnia, that to defeat.
Keeping in mind the away game (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, seems evident that the thing is not determined.
Portugal dominated the party for more than one hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that him to have given the tranquility.
"It is a good result, but at the same time involves a risk, since we have not marked away".
But at home, in the luminous Stadium of the Light of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be equal of enthusiastic, even if turns out to be evident that the party "is very even", dixit a Bento optimistic but clear.
"We expect that the party be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front", declared the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
"We continue having a 50% of possibilities of participating in the Eurocopa 2012", has, nevertheless, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The tie of Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and to win.
To the Bosnians would be able them to arrive a tie, although also they have need to mark.
"It is a good result, but at the same time involves a risk, since we have not marked away", regrets Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that possesses a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality", added.
Just like in Zenica, the Portuguese Iran with the intention to exercise, since the principle, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians for "not to leave them time to think".
A good idea, provided that, this time, be realist.
