Lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owners
Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn make not only the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from the appointment of the stays in hotels and pensions.
It can in giant still free room for all dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid, binding.
And if they call us immediately, ask whether, we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "On" will be the operator of the information portal spindl. info, Martin Jandura.
Who the New Year's Eve-stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers the saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The hotel owners now for the day mostly only stays.
I think that they are, for a time to sell them, but then they have to give in, and for shorter periods.
And then the free room quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all dates is always, always the travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The day in giant can also offer the Vrchlabi-travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter also negatively affected by that giant is no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the Pisten within a week, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, to fill the rooms in the Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five per cent more than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas, we have only a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, will also run the business well informed, the director of the best Pec-hotels, Karel Rada.
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also the hotel in Central Park in Janske Lazne occupied.
However, remains at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60%.
A bit weaker is now the February, but, at the moment when the snow comes, is also the interest in the spent in giant, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a more mess the hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it should cool and if there is rain, that should be the snow on the mountains.
But then again, is a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech office in Hradec Kralove.
UNITED STATES: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with which schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, he even for the most stupid.
When he finally his eagerly-awaited Afghanistan-ausschwitzte doctrine, it was that HE this on the kopierpapier from the Bush Iraq three years ago.
Not only that he, several times in the text itself, the saying goes, "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "New Way" without hesitation.
He has even three years ago, the Bush-idea - to send fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
The following months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military strategy, the only possible and was very successful, that today in the news about Iraq no longer.
The Bush's reputation has not improved, because he has left his successor a much dankbarere starting position, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have again asked the military, especially the commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley Mccristal, even despite the subordinationsgewohnheiten the criticized in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The president for three months, but with no better idea, and so he has the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000, even if he originally with at least 10,000.
Highly problematic about the Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Also, despite the war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well-structured, its leaders to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the indication - no one can rely on and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correct, only buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations will make.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimum objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time Horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the Small Soldiers in the war on the "Homecoming" create a miracle here, can only be a truly romantic soul, which is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians and their voters do not want to explain the way the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush-is.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate, and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner is withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time, so that it can use to a different strategy, fallls would prove to be a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no more in cash
The chief executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year more in cash.
The company has announced that the responded to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers instead of the money, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they are too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of the effort, the bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after she had for the first three quarters of this year, $17 billion dollars for set aside.
The total amount of bonuses during the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency also reported today, despite the measure to exceed $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, exceed the 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five women have taken in Stockholm today from the hands of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel Prizes in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists was under the German writer Herta Müller, Romanian origin, including.

The amounts in each category of 10 million Swedish kronor.
If there are several winners in each category, the money will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the US president, Barak Obama, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
He has in his speech the kontrovere his appointment, because it is only at the beginning of his journey, and at the head of the country, the two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of his policy, he added, however, that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning, the finance minister, Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form of this was released by the Assembly on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota in the Cabinet will be the themes of the meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On another wants to remain in his post Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the Budget Law, which now Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In parliament, but on Wednesday on the left-proposals on money and the money for the salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and wages of farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the Social Democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and party, on the other hand, is a sharp domestic political dispute, because the question mark over the future work of the Fischer-cabinet, on the design of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by the parliament, the package of austerity measures imposed by the- government in the autumn, and that is to end their understanding of the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not today, said the breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have been neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS leader, Mirek Topolanek, that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS-chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described in the editorial similar words as "strong".
The CSSD leader Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek-words that the budget deficit is horrifying, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that the 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country shows of the fight and win despite some criticisms that the main role was filled by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the year Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The two-year-old actor, the price for his role in the Eastwood-drama from the Boxbereich had received "Million Dollar Baby", was the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end of the slave owners, a fictional US president, and also in "Evan God", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former statesman was for his active career in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 to undfür four years he was president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film recounts a true story of the Nelson Mandela of his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, in order to reach the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still legally and economically.
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides to, the rugby players in the world to the outsiders.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela-history on the screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role, this as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said, if he and the world would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, with him to eat and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have noticed that when I give you the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what they are, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the world.
It was a great surprise for him, when he met for the first time in his house.
I remember, when I rang the door bell that he opened up and the first thing I said to FranÃ§ois Pienaar in my life, was:' In the film I see much'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has received under the guidance of director Eastwood, "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" positive reviews, and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of The Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was a very good, very well ausgefÃ¼hrter film."
In the film on the Web pages rottentomatoes. com, has received Invictus 76 percent positive evaluations.
Secret on Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But the launch, was not successful and as a type "Bulava" missile, which was to be the pride of the Russian army, is a nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, writes about "Bulava" than a "missile, not flies."
A missile, which is not flies, but
This already 13th attempt, at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third stage.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which under the water of the White Sea.
This type allows the shooting down of the submarine.
It is likely that caused by an unspecified fliegendes object mysterious light on the damaged "Bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals has diesesmal and claims that it cannot speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell not affected and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test without mistakes, the leadership of the Defense Ministry only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost 50% success, therefore, the generals with optimism and so will continue to claim that the "Bulava" Fly Even without problems and even to ten hyperschall-nuclear warheads with a total weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes.

The legendary players Vjaceslav Fetisov, with 51 years in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holders helps his team CSKA Moscow in the distress, and is probably already in the Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career with forty years ago, in 1998, has been completed, is the current president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency quoted the coach of the club of Sergei Nemcinov.

Hyundai was the unions after all overtime will be lifted.
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
Because of overtime, the union announced the strike on Monday.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The board wants to, but with the trade unionists still on a Saturday in this week.
We must not abandon our plan, which is a principle, therefore, on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime for the reason that two working groups would be worked, Vanek said.
The website sedmicka. cz wrote that the company's staff, which would work, a bonus of 400 CZK has offered.
The staff also in the event for the class of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime pay or they can take for holidays on 28 December, and so the Christmas holidays, led to Vanek.
In addition, all the members of the the fares and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime the most urgent and most burning issue demands and complaints of trade unionists were last week, the production, the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk.
The staff of the factory until last week, had been forced to work virtually every day after the hour 2 overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the willingness on the part of the trade unions.
Negotiations between the management of the factory and trade unionists on Friday afternoon.
The Union Leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and can sign a joint document that they are willing to lift the strike.
The situation in the car factory, last week, on Wednesday, when some 400 employees spontaneously for permanent overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions and alleged harassment.
The board, that the staff of the overtime to comply with the car-needs.
The trade unionists in Ihremmontags also demanded that the staff, the last Wednesday of the production, with no penalties.

Czech discovery: a substance, which also works in' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact, against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants is not as strong, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug but can prolong the life and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
Their use is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus also has the development sg. Viruses, against which no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the vscht (chemisch-technological university) Prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how to deal with the virus.
They have proven that the known as metalokarborane substances on the protein, which is responsible for the increase of HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links, the virus-reproduction in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new ´ improved links, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfÃ¤chige cages from Bor-, hydrogen and carbon atoms and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and constant virus
HIV protease is substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus caused by the HIV-protease would not mature.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the researchers in the press report, issued by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work was published in the newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole ranks of the compounds, in which two couples of cages (see table) are linked by a brief organic chain, then systematically.
A weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV protease wurdne tested in, even against their steady (resistant), which were won by HIV-infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme-variant is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the variants, against the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical, the metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research on the development of effective against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
DISPUTE OVER BUDGET. ods went to fishermen, the fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, in his opinion, should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the prime minister as a "strong."
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS-chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is to remain in office through the left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to, Necas pointed out.
The parliament on Wednesday approved the budget for the year 2010, but with party-amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the Social Democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the Budgetprovisoriums frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota would have seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment on the verhandugn of the budget.
To the fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if parliament will continue to deficit-boosting laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the law should be changed.
Topolanek, the ODS nominated ministers were not
That is a matter for the prime minister, fishermen and the government.
The ministers nominated by the ministers made no mistake, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in function people are trying to top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen in decides, on the fight against the deficit-level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in parliament".
He then allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens can count on Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said of the Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak the journalists in parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the prime minister.
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS, probably on Wednesday in parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the premier members of the Democrats would explicitly ask that allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic has not diminished.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I have to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at bolschewisierung of parliament and destruction of all would be positive, Topolanek itself.
Under the new map of the CD (Czech Railways) will be fewer trains for roughly the same fare.
The Czech Railways or restricted from 13 December some less its- and local trains, other links will be strengthened.
The whole transport volume from the day of the new map compared with today at 2%.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several opportunities in the capital, for example, the inhabitants of the area, the railways, for this line of the type Pendolino trains.
The train will no longer be Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle, the direct links from Prague to Letohrad reduced.
The biggest reduction in the railways in the District of Hradec Kralove (Graz), a total of eight per cent, on a rise can look forward to the Prague and environment.
Be lifted two night trains on the route from Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on some days in the week of the operation of some fast trains on the route from Prague Pisek - Budweis reduced.
One of the biggest changes include the introduction of the new direktverkehrsweges from Milovice to Prague, now, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The long-distance in the capital will be in the station Prague - station.
The CD is more SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk/Jesenik in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional rail: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Department of Transport, the railways to reimburse the so-called loss in the next year, four billion kronor, as this year. The local trains supply the districts, overall, they have to pay for that in the next year, eight billion kronor, while the state three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the trains and the fast trains, completed the railways a ten-year contract, until now, the treaty was only for a year.
The railways praises the system, perhaps it has not also to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
To changes, it is only in one-day net and favourable internetfahrscheinen Eliska.
For passengers without the card will be the price CD net of 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of Eliska will then depend on the, until now, it was for the travel between any cities uniform and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine millitante take more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Mr kidnapped today in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some school pupils and their teachers.

But on Tuesday the peace negotiations with the government once again.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods in American cinema "Invictus: The Ungeschlagene", which is a part of the history of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid, Morgan Freeman, was already a few years ago, allegedly by Mandela himself.
The role of the legendary South African champions in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the launch of the film will also be reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
With whole name means he rolihlaha Nelson Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sachar-price, in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
The president of the Republic of South Africa, he was elected in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film, because it comes at a time in the cinema, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup in South Africa, but at the same time, the media world opinion with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against the ruling from the black majority.

Morgan Freeman is his own words on the new film still proud.
From this role, I have for many years and I have been well prepared.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can watch - as they say - his energy, he said in the interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that it is a good thing if this film to the personality of Nelson Mandela and his message errinern.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the Book of the presentation of the British writer John Carlin, translated in the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people, the South African defenders of human rights within its first period.
Morgan Freeman is in the course of the film, two races and each other for mutually defined groups together and, as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also won in his role in the South African National-Rugbydress at the World Cup, the then South Africa.
For the lawn in the dress, which is in South Africa, almost as a sacred act, Mandela Fourteen years ago, mostly by the white audience and has won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Cup it was perhaps the people turn to a single people, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995, the only "black" in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa, that will be seen.
The white South Africans are sceptical, such as, for example, in a recent interview for the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, betrayed, from the country fled to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jancura for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura today for libel against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district, Radko Martinek from the district and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a minute inteview on radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company, the regional rail traffic in some districts.
All regions have signed, but at the end of the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three of us and say that we pick the cherries, we have made the offer only on the size, as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were completed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend us.
Because of this defamation of society Student Agency, said the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection of the complaint for the continuation of the show of Jancura it as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I would urge other head on.
I assume that this matter will be clear that it IS, IN THE MATTER OF THE REGIONALEINSENBAHNVERKEHRS manipulated the public and used false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kronor in the advertising, which will highlight the damaging step of the districts.
The Journal, he said that he wants to continue the campaign after Christmas, and New Year.
He stated that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the districts at the behest of the regional rail transport agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a high at 150 billion kronor had no invitations to tender.
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and incompatible with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we do not do that, then we can also lose the buslizenzen.
He was a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I am not saying his name, said today the Journal.
Vaccination against pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now that the-vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate.
The institute already set the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also on the procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August-children
From January children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not received a dose.
Anyone who has already started the vaccine in the last year or earlier, must also pay for itself.
The first dose must be given between 3 and 5th month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
They save, but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all vaccination of children spent around 500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die after investigation in hospitals per year for up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty-vaccination of children against pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be in the future.
From January to be paid for by the insurance and voluntary.
That the vaccination would be better, said, for example, the head of the citizens association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association, in the long term for the Pneumokokken-vaccination.
The experts at the International Conference, in which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health, but the procedure against Pneumokokken does not change.
At this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the society of practical doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of the number "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine as a voluntary," says Allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents their infants against pneumokokken from next year.
The vaccination against pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that this is also the first paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, Erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
So that is a concern of the practical doctors, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and doctors in the same way, as well as other issued by the state to them.
Some members, however, feared that the insurance so "The money from the health insurance could".
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance companies to pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual doctors to invest 40 000 per month, which is a significant sum of money.
This will not be easy, says.
They and we still
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters voted for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims in one of the Säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated and be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French no scarves Love" (original title: "Why the French don't like headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a contentious issue which divided the country about one and a half decades and employees and their effects are still visible today.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and more spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and colleges, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free" offer.
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students, on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall marry (or both)?
Should young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use an interest-oriented banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly down-to-earth matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, Bowen, are usually at odds with their Salafi counterparts supporters of the Puristischen Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia, which is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He is to what extent French political leaders (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the values" as a growing pragmatism.
The Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other region on Earth.
The ice, which is, is melting at an alarming rate and is living with that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice"), a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bears.
In the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich sea, only with the rifle butt muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, which, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today have still typically a millionth of the life of a wild alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: the eisbÃ¤r in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat, the hunters for the survival of the species.
Although in Norway, America and Russia, which is banned in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and sleigh-Fahrende Inuit powerful assault rifles use to bring their prey on the route.
Ironically, in the waters of the north of these two nations the ice longest.
In his new book, "after the ice" (original title "After the ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the magazine "New Scientist", a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither scientists still ozeanografen can adequately explain the speed of change.

"In a few months, we could be"
Marines were among the 6,000, in Arlington wreaths laid down
The obergefreite de' Angello Robinson went seven hours with the bus in order to lay a wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other Marines, the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the National Cemetery in Arlington, to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they are.
In a few months, from where we are, we could be, said Robinson on the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would hope that someone would do the same thing for me, so I am trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, holder of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992, this tradition, as he and some others decided to several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, this trip each year, in various cities along the road to events, the people in the military and are paid to victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Wreaths Across America), the event has also extended to other states.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of the National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time, more than 150,000 dollars for purchase and transport of the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased soldiers.
Although her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we can support our soldiers and civilians.
It is as if the visit of a family tomb.
Wrapped in warm clothes were the volunteers across the vast land and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the first and second world war and the Vietnam War as an objective, since they are not as often as the newer graves visited, the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while the fresh pine branches on the grey.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, which was on the upper part.
The section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 to this section, but the mood of the current wars in this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed and families and friends to each other in the icy air.
Some to read aloud the names written in stone, while others are too small black-white cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who, before the grave of her son bitter tears.
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marineinfranterie-Corporal David Shane Spicer, to visit in July in the fight.
No one should ever forget why we are free, my son has paid for it, she said.
"If I am no longer, I would like to see someone like him."
The US government by Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor for the US Government, mobile phones and notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which until now has not yet been identified, working for Development Alternatives, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
In the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the charge of "risk" can be arrested.
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include the protests and critical writings, a risk.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Cuba and the Castro brothers in the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by The New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government is taking concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has allowed ordinary citizens this year, the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet is on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect their names to the government.
Too many Web access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba who are in prison, are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press for the US interests in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants very often within a day, were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would probably be politically, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move for greater willingness to engage in dialogue with each other.
Pakistani government officials plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly on Saturday, the head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist to, the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had a shadowy insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the Al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which has become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and tried to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of agencies in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, the decision on who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made it a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within al Qaeda.
The act as guardians of the organization, not those who let, whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would-be recruits from a Qaeda a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US-and its propaganda value, but also as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years have become much more cautious in regard to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to anyone in these groups, what better way could go as the model to follow, which so many have followed?, said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen Climate "Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella Centre in the city of bold action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city.
On a day when the by the UN-sponsored climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, which was in English, "there is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared that "the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who has said that the trips to Peru, the land of their mother, her of what problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change.
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to take part in the major demonstration - to pass on the floor and appeal to the world leaders to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either or pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned.
According to a witness, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, several explosive devices demonstrators in black clothes in the vicinity of the Copenhagen channel, near where several ministries.
They threw it in the vicinity of the buildings, he said, and added that it began as missiles, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
In the interior of the Centre the people on television screens, the whole afternoon to watch the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the officials, such as Su, as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something that I was not even aware of."
He then in Mandarin and said: "Because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He stated that it is from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "We can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the show that the fourth- and achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent gap between African-American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average number of the white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), their African-American peers, but only three points from 209 at 212.
In reality, the Gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically significant point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture of a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the number of the children of both groups have achieved in that time span, has reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district last week expressed its concern that the results of Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were celebrated, for the most part of white pupils who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of DC Voice, a nonprofit group that for the educational equality in Washington D. C..
I do not for a period of two or three points, and down, said the Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton-primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the figures is that the secondary schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course, we would like to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend the time and energy that we have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new curriculum, reading, the Wilson-reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their careers and significantly behind their classmates.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to the sixth class games and real life experience to the fore, was brought under the former chief inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP, which were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit from the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to provide the extra money and resources for the schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the Urban Audit results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political fallout, work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closing of the achievement gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is in Washington, currently 180 days, in order to compete with the charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a major increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg-college with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the facades and the green lawn.
Gracielas parents have the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, had also Graciela, was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, was more of a respectful visitor, rather than an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said they thought, as the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have the intended message: The question is not whether it's college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States Hispanic immigrants, not end the high school or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, the college education is needed in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of the college, which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, in the United States, without the high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study the powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent them to success.
Many of them have parents who give their children set high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But they also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to in college, especially if these efforts over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the search through the system, then a single measure at any time will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, the American students.
We have to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre-school through the high school.
The federal program, gracielas college tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - A high - and is more than $300 million dollars per year for local school systems available to college-preparation programs to begin, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program since 1999, more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% in college.

The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi, suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American multinationals in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war and instead of US companies Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably, analysts said, to be more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, to conclude the contracts with the ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry and maintain close relations in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other companies and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman of the ministry, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the world economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its can and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
For the Levy elected companies gave Commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to the output of each Felds increase beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is to be this week, a top planner of al Qaeda have been killed, representatives of the US-TERRORISM reported on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region of a number of missiles have been killed, which met on Tuesday in their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone, which is used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They were in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said a representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the site and quickly took everything, which was left by the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led to an unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planners of al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wanted to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
If its central role as a given, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the leaders of al Qaeda and them in planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American representative said that Somali quickly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second, but this does not reduce the risk that he was for us and our allies.
His death, if confirmed, would be the second leading al Qaeda or Taliban leader since September, was killed in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a non-operated by a website, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and, at the same time, the suspected brutally kill, reported to the side.
UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, supported by the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Oath, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, other NATO governments could lead to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
This commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he will not resign his office, but only one in March 2008 with his family to the agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that they have time to look for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to find a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, in accordance with UN representatives with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish-Italian-descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, UN peacekeeping operations, has taken into account.
OATH position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "the mission have undoubtedly damage, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election was".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries for the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome un-rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I could since May, he said, only one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because it is not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on the soul, is, if we have in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war on its own."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because "their people" will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran with "credible" consequences if it must reckon with its nuclear program to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear program, and a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran, but since that time, the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which it had already agreed at the beginning of October, has simply left, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, brought together in a way, as it did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran have never, Gates said.
President Obama has the 31. Set as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before he other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue.
In a statement issued in New York, has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it "baseless and unfounded allegations" of some Security Council members on Thursday called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays of US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August of 000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought to, the Kurdish concern about the impending withdrawal. US-quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We Will your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them, that "Mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "a baby means more a grave".
These lessons have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "In no case".
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing more, said Wang, 31, a leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled children, who are affectionately called "little emperors", has produced a crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department of Population, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in the year 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31, 1 percent to rocket. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60-year-old and older almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission has said that couples in the reproductive age babies, "in order to help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual easing
Enshrined in the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy may be the most controversial, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up to her annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy, the critical pressure on natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples had sex-selective abortions, an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for population gradually their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been children -- and 2007, the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the Beijing University, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to two children, in which is a partner child.
Shanghai in July was the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, the families, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who for a second child and how we can apply for the permit.
The city government, municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available to have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the requests from couples to see that after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported no change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of, for example, still only four or five requests per month.
Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign still around 165.000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and this is legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West, the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is pregnant with their first child in the seventh.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples for psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the head, said that she would like to just a child, because she was also a child. "We were at the centre of the family and used that everyone of us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old, a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is about to be successful and we must be selfish.
Today, the age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew to see their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "We must rebuild his home" -- and the life -- "If the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV for the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to get too many victims.
Un group plan to reduce emissions
The by the UN Conference on Climate Change, which until now by wild postures and mutual accusations -- on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with the industrial nations in the near future to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time of next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a Special UN Working Group, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be in the short- and long-term, so that they can deal with global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key questions, including how industry and major emerging countries to limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six-page document, has drafted a 180-page text, in the focus on what the leading representative of the UN Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, has described as "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the levels of 1990, would reduce, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent.
The European Community has the talks on Friday also given a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of the floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not more than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take action, so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei, said that the leading US climate negotiator either "of Common Sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States, China would not help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting, who should bear the costs of the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to more aggressive action, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, also as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are the most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants in the best-case say that the talks will lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented on early Friday morning, a 24-page draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, "political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese minister Entstiegen their aircraft and breaks through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people daily in the centre and, Gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows, in which they are make of the countries which betrayed their opinion and sell, and draft passed from hand to hand, rather than by e-mail -- is a challenge.
The intensity is just: Almost all of the important ministers are now here and on Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train defines the feeling
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe the darkness, to announce a, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed train in the country in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first javelin-services from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international network of faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
The neglected province could be commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which are needed for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable battle and fears about environmental damage could in the British high-speed still applying the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to The Times report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, linking London with the West Midlands, will combine with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site is the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also have three options for a major, leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, in which a single high-speed line in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a rail-insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, it would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals would offer the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, which the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first route was planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the London-Birmingham could be in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high-speed network.
Experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan, in his opinion, should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains would have to change from the high-speed lines on existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, the journey time between London and Scotland would in about three hours.
This is regarded as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be guaranteed a beacon for the Revolution.
Taxpayers for mortgage for a conservative on-orangerie
Alan Duncan, the senior Conservative member of the House of Commons, has the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a Orangerie in, building in his house in his constituency.
The spokesman for the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron, because he complained that House of Commons members' meager rations "to live their mortgage has increased by 75,000 pounds to a wooden-fachwerkanbau to build on his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to the taxpayer to pay the additional interest into account, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time, and they were also by Sir Thomas Legg is called into question, with a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons. Last night, said Duncan that the "Not even cleaner or more."
Duncan, one of the richest members, has a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
In the nearby houses have a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and esszimmer, but the Fees Office, a control of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has grown a garden in the plans as "orangerie".
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges not to increased borrowing.
The Committee has him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan security for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.

The normal stufenlose RBS-mortgage interest rate fell from 7, 94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where he is still standing.
The latest published by the House of Commons documents show that Duncan in this may continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his job as the opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him, when he said after the expenses scandal that parliament "of meager rations" would live.
"Basically it means if it works for the state, that you must live on meager rations and how*****E."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and entitled to a tiny part of what is measured.
And I would ask the whole damn sum, but I do not do it. "
The member, a millionaire from his former career as Ölgroßhändler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the Fees Office that this "could be considered excessive demand."
An activist, as a protest in Duncans lawn a hole in the form of a mark, after it became known that he had over three years, 4,000 pounds (500 euros).
Last night, when he was asked about the increased mortgage, said Duncan: "This was both by the Fees Office, as well as to the value of Legg has been approved."
He added: "There is no debate about and durchschlÃ¤ngeln or a bend the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and is strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clean and clear. "

The unions of prison officials have called on Friday for a global day of action in order to ensure that the bonuses and overtime, whose pay for budget reasons was postponed until January, before the Christmas holidays.
The 2 union of officials ("fo-pénitentiaire"), called for the staff who have no service on Tuesday morning before the prison to demonstrate and to block this, to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to,".
The third union of the officials ("CGT-PéNITENTIAIRE") called to unite for "a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of overtime incurred in October, as and Sundays and holiday surcharges in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable" market.

According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, according to the secretary-general of the UFAP, Jean-Francois Forget.

Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and a lot of experience, said Miss Sierra Leone with full of enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be on Saturday, 5 p.m. (15 p.m. Central European time) in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, broadcast live.
I could not imagine a nicer country to my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.

Quite extraordinary, however, was the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who has given them by the hand.
Not for a head of state, said Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory, however, remains without doubt the lots in Cape Town (South West) on the football World Cup in June 2010, a kind of the country, for this event a little more to promote.
I am wrong with people, which I otherwise probably never could.
I will come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.

It is quite clear that it is a continuation of the Tour on 8 January (in Amiens) is a little too tight, said Mr Camus.
The party UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls for the party Nouveau Centre, not to use their mark
The alliance by François Bayrou's party Modem is monitored, on Friday on a takeover attempt by the label, once by valéry giscard d'estaing party, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and under threat of prosecution, this stamp on any document to use more.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend, after he left the hand.
The defence minister, whose party is the UMP, wanted to this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (UMP, now in the NC), a claim on the property of the UDF, because he was the first for this brand in 2004 the "Institut national de la propriété industrial" has requested.
However, the unit of François Bayrou's friends alliance UDF supervised the silence and clearly gave us to understand that they are not expropriate and set the Minister and the members under threat of prosecution of a deadline, not to use this and to transfer the property rights of the brand.
They have made in the last few days, a number of statements that you would propose Your political movement, the UDF SIEGELZU + +, the Alliance wrote in one of 19 of 24 members signed the letter, including François Bayrou and Marielle De Sarnez, the party Modem and the senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They also believed to be that you have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau Centre +, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the start of your website.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the NC party, to remove "immediately the mention of the name UDF of material and (their) website."
In addition, one of Mr Hervé de Charette, "the property rights of the brand to their legal transfer."
If you refuse, we will take action against them, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter they stress that "udf" is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978, and remind you that Morin and his friends "have made the choice to leave this 2007, in order to start a competing movement, as it had done in 2002, to the UMP party" ".
The party Nouveau Centre has, therefore, according to the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la Démocratie française).
They continue to remind you that the last congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year membership of the party Modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, has passed.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the Secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has for the brand name, for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner, by the absence of the deposit of the UDF to carry out this for themselves.
You have to bear in mind that this recklessness is on the best ways to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, but in politics as in life, to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by, of a name, it has no legal rights".

Equally, however, the 15th criminal court ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and hauptaktionärin of, has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation of the prosecutor in Nanterre conditions.
The doctors are appointed on Friday before the 10 March 2010 to present a report, in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt, in a state of weakness may have been found.
I think they will to these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt, a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and allroundkünstler, and accused him of the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt had always been refuted by the photographers have been manipulated, which it sees as a long-time friend.
Although the Court The admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would have to examine the complaint, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large debacle.
So, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt on three of his klientin to their lawyer sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I for 15 years, or twice daily to Banier wrote.
Françoise, I have never been since their marriage to talk more. "
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of law, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic education?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers from the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determines the best, as it was on the consumer-products of the technicians in the station.
By customers in the heart of the company, the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again.
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, which affects the employees.
This has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of r &amp; EUND, what is even more, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU (intelligence economique = Economic Intelligence) "by all parties (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking"; it is a commitment by the staff, the instructions of the authoritarian management completely.
That is why we are calling for a revolution, which would be the staff in of the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers.
The very conditional use of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately, not.
- First, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many, finally, the priority to do what it has always done. ...
Also because of the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders have a very simplified view of human behavior.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the American "Neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible to, the "Leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro. fr poll by IPSOS executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The factors Identify and measure
Instead, a necessary revolution for the smooth functioning of the modern companies the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental record: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that they set their companies on the basis of a Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it allows them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can predict the executives of the companies' social performance "control, and to anticipate and their human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable.
The speech of OSLO: The "just war" Obama praise from the right
The American rights on Friday by Barack Obama on the eve of speech in Oslo, and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, this time applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "necessary" war in its recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force; a way to explain his entscheidungvon nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world," in the words of Obama's.
In some parts of this speech as historic, said, in the radio programme "The Takeaway" has been questioned.
The previous member of by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to see a "president of the Left" to have seen the members of the Nobel committee that they "were not free and a price for peace could not, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of The Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition, that it is a "kosmopolit", as he always does, "he said," as an American president, "as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they did not create and for their protection they do not do much, "Gerson.
Among the few, not the rights, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspiration".
To the left of the president of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
The war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the Innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker, who is known for his talent, as a "monumental".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" At the same time.
Long-distance drivers: three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply at Christmas
After a three-week marathon, the trade unions of the Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation, which until the end on Friday evening to an agreement, the strike order and the threat of severe bottleneck at an end to Christmas.
In the signature on Friday evening, "welcomed" the for the Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau, the agreement on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations was launched.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiating on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement at the end of the morning to sign.
And despite the fact that the three employers' Federation (FNTR, UNOSTRA and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the Agreement and only at 18:00 p.m., the agreement was signed.
The conflict, "the company would have very much damage" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8, 72 euros to 9 euros.
"It is not very much, but we start small," Mr Clos (FO).
The activists are now, not to block the supply centers.
"It will probably always be some recalcitrant, however, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF-chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition ".
According to him, is the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said on this, "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3% and the upholding of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable it, in particular, to the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the burden on employers to the tune of 100 million," the subject of an amendment to the government on the bill of the finances for 2009, which was in the night from Thursday to Friday was adopted by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension of the Minister for the entire profession.
This will be "in a very short period of time" of the case, Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euro "were the sector to offset some of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the bird-in the approaching Christmas Day, laments the UNOSTRA.
For the association OTRE threatens the agreement "to small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a very grave."

The RER A disruption on the line, the largest rail network in France for the Paris and the Île-de-France, at the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike between the unions and the management of the RATP Paris (independent passenger transport management), the strikers with their demands for wage increments.

So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than usual, particularly because of the lack of high school.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier on time to get to work."
The SNCF, the care of the public by officials and security forces had planned, pointed out that in the Saint-Lazare train station to no bottlenecks.
The SNCF on the RER line A or direction Cergy-le-SKIN-powered trains came and went on the Saint-Lazare train station, in order to ensure the end of the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday once again of the strikers, during which the results were reviewed, the associations after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon classified as "poor".
The RER-business leaders proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line on all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (SUD), they are calling for a long overdue wage premium.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP even their proposals in brackets, and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, but the long-distance lorry drivers and the SNCF was also possible."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting to "comprehensive examination of the conditions" is scheduled for Monday.
This shows the associations, too, that the company "The drivers ignored."

The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish party in the country; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to the Kurdish community to extend the hand in order to put the past 25 years of conflict to an end.

The decision followed a year in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya operational procedures. He accused the DTP, the "Instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is seen as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.

The party to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the constitutional court between the government, which is anxious to accommodate the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.

After the verdict was Türk, that the decision of the court, "the despair further".
"Turkey can this (Kurdish, ANM. Editorial) on the basis of the ban of a party," he told the press.

"We oppose in principle against the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political observers Ahmet island.
"It is obviously a reaction from the PKK," he added.
On Thursday, the PKK to an attack in which three days earlier, seven soldiers were killed in the north of the country. It was one of the most brutal attacks of recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict location for secret defence research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 miles from the Moscow Centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives had contacts with the Frankfurt science riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and on Wednesday now and Riedberg in Frankfurt and signed a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow-mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the science foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd Travel.
Scientific Exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for Technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist city" for the defence research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply, "the new heart of Europe".
So. S21 is much more than the low of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, the city of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in utter chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Stations with tracks, right in the middle of the city, were seen at the time as technical fossils of the 19th century, as a modern rail transport, as it once was a huge amount of time, umzuspannen locomotives from behind forward.
, briefly, to go further - so s.
And that is why the stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station, about half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the results and the Bavarian city is almost impossible to implement the place.
However, stations have no one and problem, since there are modern trains, with locomotives and cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the ice-building after Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local politicians have it.
The railways, power with, partly because the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state.
The project is still reasonably justified.
It is New Area, which is the computer generated graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system is harmful.
The station and the expansion are intended for the movement, which - typical 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first be to strengthen the freight transport, since the transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route because of intense climbs is not for freight trains.
Much more serious is that s21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is, in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180-kilometer route through the valley.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
Would be urgently needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The valley is the real bottleneck for international freight transport, right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the airport
The provincial government has left open in the wiesbadener, whether they will go against the judgment of the Hessischen Administrative Court (VGH) night flights in review.

Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the provincial government attempts to "rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to come to their night flights.
A precise legal examination of their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a secure entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition, the statements of his group the ban on night flights.
US banks pay back aid
The troubled US banks their government shackles.
The Bank of America on Wednesday, the aid from the fund TARP amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And also the Citigroup plans after a report by the US-channel CNBC to reimburse the state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions with the adoption of the money gone about the reduction in the payment of bonuses and pay high fees.

QUICK ELECTION
It was then everything faster than thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF-board the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender had pushed out of office, the station can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the panel on the Personalie wanted to vote.
As the favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-studios in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, may also have played a role, the ZDF-Intendanten Markus Schächter not further damage, this proposal to the board of directors do not get through.
Frey, schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet in this edition.
Two weeks ago, was schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender failed to extend for a further five years, on the board.
Only seven members for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a bitter defeat for Schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not in office to confirm.
Had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that Brender had lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, he rejected a further term of the highly regarded journalist.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Finally, even 35 staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate, the actions as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on 4 August 1957.
He studied politics, education and romanistik.
After that, he worked in the radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey on ZDF, first on the "today-Journal."
Subsequent phases: in 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chefredakteurs; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; Until 1998 director and moderator of "magazine"; by 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF-studios.
The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders who was elected on Wednesday by the leaf medium magazine for journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the board, the Rhineland-Pfälzische prime minister Kurt Beck, said in the last week, the countries should change the ZDF state treaty so that proposals of the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, however, also Beck.
Brenders Voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board with a bold move, by the body immediately after the Brender-abwahl for that.
Thanks to this belegs journalistic independence both schächter without loss of face for the post of chief nominate and the board, without the suspicion, a party to into office.
In the party arithmetic is to the left-wing liberal.
Study will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: After a year of education drew the culture ministers of the countries on Thursday at last: at a meeting of Ministers and Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions in bachelor and master.
The students should in the future be able to handle their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden: in principle, each Study only with a single test.
Moreover, the workload of the students and to be "a realistic and reasonable level".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of services between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common targets for bachelor and masters and more flexible.
Different regulations should not be.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture Minister and uni-RECTORS the dictum of the better in the mouth.
Now it was for the first time with a specific content.
The so-called Council decided to reduce the number of tests, in part: "Each module usually with only a test," it says in a 30-page document, which is to regulate the admission of new courses in part.
With the "significant reduction in the burden,", said the council-Reinhold Grimm, should be a "trend, the studierbarkeit significantly."
Moreover, the "studierbarkeit" in the future, "the decisive factor" in the design.
Modules as content are "strictly to examine" whether "unnecessary one of the students in the choice of
Events "would be avoided.
The students' right to maintain margins, the initiative and promote ".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all be five years' reakkreditiert ", which means that it will take until 2015, all courses were reviewed.
Are responsible for ten agencies, which the Council established by the countries.
The culture minister had urged the countries in October "with vigour" to the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too the regime.
In individual, universities and technical colleges with the ministries have already agreed to take appropriate measures.
So far as the only country said in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna Process additional funds.
The money from the universities in particular, and advice and review and offices.
Country and Universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the law to parliament.
This is for the conclusion of a model only one test.
The study design should be more flexible, to the recognition of other universities and the access to the master.
By the end of next year, all courses of the country on their studierbarkeit should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition had on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Bureau of the Juso-groups called for the organisation of education policy should in future be "Behind Closed Doors" the minister and university rectors.
After the latest strikes should now also the students "have a say."
Support the future graduates received from the president of the Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK), Margaret coat: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The Trade Union Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: It calls for a legal right, each graduates with a bachelor-close access to a secondary Masters Course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor-students tomorrow tomorrow with the best possible conditions available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar.
The countries must hire more teachers.
A freer access to the Master the culture minister, however, did not.

Visibly confused and move to read out a statement in which he German colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation in the secret service for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present had söllner 1989, the German language.
The attempts have begun, first in 1971.
I am, therefore, "someone who is against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The Poet Werner Söllner is Walter.
Almost at the same time, with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania, shaken by a case of the abyss and the cowardice of a political system, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as we can tell, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate-acts have played a role in the Walter, said after the confession söllners scientist Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it in all for him at the time sensitive points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this point.
Söllners statement was unexpected in the form and in this audience, surprising is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate-, had already been Herta Müller in July at the time, after they had their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people concerned, we must be, and in some case may also have known what lay behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the now very safe sighting of the Stasi-files is dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate files (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that the administration of the files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former Securitate head from Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a climate, after all, they interrogated only once.
The scandal of the power to said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case, as so often in connection with sneak fault, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The measured response of the to Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
In Champions League
It felt as if there is a smart außendienstler of a very nice Christmas party at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed goodies, as the new VfB-coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C-Class.
The Man With The was because of him foreign city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive - Alcohol was not in the game, and was the 55-year-old as Little.
It was a pleasant evening, but this is the work continues.
Or will not.
In the words of the first three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then it is to repeat in Mainz, the king-class performance in the league-daily.
And the once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by marica (5), träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).

The final of the Champions League (HINSPIELE 16/17 + 23/24 February / RüCKSPIELE 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy at the start of the Babbel-remained so.
Not only the supposed saviours of, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and Game.
I am on the players and told them that they should back to their strengths, and they have encouraged to be courageous, plumber Gross said that as simple recipe for success, the therapeut Babbel but had had any effect.
He has a certain magic, pro-- Jens Lehmann, "If a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of injury break, thanks to its dynamism straight to the best players on the field, the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors to describe: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, work.
As Gross, players and managers, the victory against a weakened and completely on defense of the Romanian guests.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 in the evil awakening, Khedira to mind.
And sports executive Horst Heldt warned that a goal has been achieved, but the other is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a just before the game-broadcast television interviews of gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh.
There are decisions that other meetings, and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism.
Had the board of leadership shown weakness and the coach have decided to pressure Pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after play had been withdrawn, Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "by pure selfishness," Keilte Heldt and announced consequences for the man.
They will not be friends for life, the two forty years.
After all, but they were with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste the and strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," said Heldt and in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
WORLD CUP fight in the heavyweight
Hitziges duel in Bern: provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy-after version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimously.

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: green group, JÃ¼rgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and left for clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg / BERLIN - After the latest findings on the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two trains in September "knowingly the falsehood," said Green group, Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the Ard-News "".
It is called the LandlÃ¤ufig: He lied.
The order to kill was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only the destruction of the abducted vices, but also two Taliban leaders to kill.
In the German Kunduz-Commander Colonel Klein US air strikes, according to NATO-report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, the Social Democrats and left on Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag to and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of Afghanistan policy, the federal government - and whether the federal chancellor, armed forces and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and green-Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not on specific operations of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.

He has not received a reply, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the allegations and pointed out that this will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which formed next Wednesday.
Worlds
Some people see in Wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it happens in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and entities.
However, who in the traumartige conditions, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicts, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug.
Blame our imagination: The same neural processes that enable us to design houses, to paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that blurred the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality.
Traumartig changed conditions can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the experiences of the New-Age-prophet Carlos Castaneda, Schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger of the brain - and dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - and the interaction of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The force has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861, a "great similarity of one with Dream", the dream of Sigmund Freud was "a climate, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, of such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and Quietschbunt.
The force has no power over him, he is hanging in the ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him with red, distorted fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They hunt him, him with serious, boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, voices from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and tightening the noose around the neck.
.
The noose is.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in Trommelfellzerfetzendem Choir, "Walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, he is bi-low, he takes medication, against the depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years, he is married.
In the climate of I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is treated as the second most common illness after the Depression.
In an acute schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are in a state can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia.
This is particularly the voices - vote, comment on, or dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is important no longer to separate, the brain can no longer disturbing signals, the awareness is flooded with impressions.
As the dream of the opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes come from.
The reality of perception in the climate is, says Professor Thomas Fox, director of the clinic for General Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is in the middle of it, everything has its importance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and it cannot make.
So often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality is not possible, the images are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a.
Unlike in the dream, says, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the climate, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in the reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why exactly our brains, researchers are still a mystery.
Exceptional situations in every person can lead to that he loses the short-term, says Fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain at an early stage of development, will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fox explained.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, which is also the first not over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for a psychosis, if the choice is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, as they are in the system.
If our brain is
The is, psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are money for drugs in order to get, says the lübecker psychology professor Erich castes.
Whether as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Castes collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and phenomena in the last year, he has evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from content, that would normally be withheld.
They arise if areas, in which are processed, or too little; if our brains, or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also of deprivation, stress, or other mental.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents, at least once in their life to have experienced a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl, really.
If it were not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it.
If he says, look at the classmates It surprised - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They believe the timid girl for a day, but Sarah K., it knows it.
It is awake, you see and hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank to see and hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the young.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other is not real, and then disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are most frightening
Often, the are also a burden.
If you are sitting in the room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just presents a new classmates, while he explained for all other- and visible from the bar of mathematical equations.
At night, the phenomena are most frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they can often not distinguish whether it is awake or already, whether the pictures you see the fratzen or the girl with the bleeding wounds of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in, the figures.
Parents and friends told them, they would be mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She has in the past year the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet to contact with the psychologists castes, she knows that she is not crazy.
It is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or under withdrawal, he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a child, as a little girl fear of other children, often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 when they learned that the man they called daddy, since they can think of is not their biological father.
As visual and audio hallucinations in the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality. "Every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Night Dream images of caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unreal.
Castes advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
State between dream and hallucinations
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience, unfortunately, Pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale-hospital in Düsseldorf.
A climate is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - Madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide form, a special form of traumartig modified awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, the erlebende for real, and he cannot distinguish from the.
The Oneiroide State in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example in polyradikulitis patients, in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person is threatened by loss of self- and world, for example, continuing, total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality by their own imaginary world, the reality is, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of state between dream and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation is not possible in the world, a world of change is taking place, but the real situation is in the imagination.
An intensive form of foundation and meaning in a precarious situation, the US people own ability, not in a loss of the loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid-experiences in his book "Change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body in the intensive care unit of doomed.
Claussen, a in a self-created world, to other times and places: He is seen as a bettlÃ¤gerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, nobles, the drugs from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his own country, with his hospital bed in the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, and later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, I have the memories from mental travel and even after years in minor details.
More and more even than Real.
The intensity of this erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other life experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
At the end of the oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and, how fragile our internal copies of external reality in the Guards.
Any change of the state, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new chief Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda company in the hands of his two children, he told the Mirror.
The holding company will also in future to 100 per cent of the family.
HAMBURG - The publisher Hubert Burda, his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the will to enter into the company, said the 69-year-old the mirror.
The details we have, as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, only then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot 7 500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is from January by the board, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen since 1999, a member of the board in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury, the responsibility for the assets, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, pressure and finances.
For the first time, is not a family member at the top of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also, "10 to 15 years to bridge," Burda.
The holding should continue to 100 per cent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not safe from the sinking: "It was always families who were infected by a capital, which have completely and thought that they could rise as a major player.
My strategy was never.
He had "never had dreams", Burda.
I am not as the political präzeptor of this country, as it was, and I do not want to play in the world league with' Time', these shops are too great.
The promises of fonpeek
Peek is limited, a device with which you can only read his e-mails, without possibility to be able to see a certain annexes or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, when the magazine Time on one of the products of the year.
It is on the road to see is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that it has two new products on the market: One, that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a long free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, in which it must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has come as a surprise.
The monthly price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, for the whole of Europe.
Those with a smartphone travel around the world, already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read his e-mails, once you cross the border, or if you are desperate for a café with WiFi (or a link with FON).
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses in order to be able to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Outside of their own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
That a small device as fonpeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name of FON, although it has no WiFi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariffs, means that the telephone providers must start and slowly but surely, to consider various ways to how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without snags.
It is an Internet equipment and pay for only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what I expect of Fonpeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already in the United States.
And that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
The colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the color of the American first lady.
With the arrival of Barack Obama as president of the United States, appeared in a dress and a coat of the colour and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models, that it was almost the same color - a bright yellow, the clothes of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and it was something groÎ²fÃ¶rmig gesticktes or a chain.
It even goes so far as that at first sight, it seemed that the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the way, from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and one from Gemusterten in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with high paragraphs and the second time a Ã¤nhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were on this occasion as wreath, with the previous the hair.
75% of working mothers, because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women's study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study is that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family, and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who do no other work of the house, only part-time work or have no fixed contract of employment, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a strong have their first child, on average, only 3.7 years after the draw, a number that increased to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this and their together and have the first child until much later.
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the willingness, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the education or a higher education, on average, each with 25, 1 or 1 for the first time mother.
There is still, depending on their level of education, a difference between the women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and have their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and only a permanent and then marry later and have their first child, Delgado.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth
L'orÃ©al Paris has recently added to its widely envied list of a new name: Diane Kruger.
From next year will be the German actress the image of various products of the brand and also the well-known slogan "Because they are worth it".
The Hauptdarstellerin from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, it will be another famous advertisement as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
It was the last to join this exclusive club to the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
The men, the company also only ambassador: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday as of today - met in the annual award ceremony, which was held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they were all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, was elected the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presented in "Poker the asse" (Alfaguara, depictions of Fernando Vicente) to the Dreiβig X-ray images of writers, him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He used a predictable and furchteinflöβendes genre (short biography, life and work), but is looking for a Änhlichkeit the fervent heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent saves neither horrors still erleuchtungen.
Except that this book is a köstlicher, it is also a stirring call to read and read.
Here are a few from the book.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous, just as I have always felt it without words: The joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, Allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife, that almost killed him."
Graham Greene: "Our man was from this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, so in its ranks, whose meat in the emotions on the grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the face of corruption."
On James Joyce's "Ulysses" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 er summit of the world literature, you must be on the north wall, on the wall, which the best mountaineers try. "
On William Faulkner: "The was a comical Kauz.
He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a county and other times, he said that he was the son of a black and a krokodils.
Both dreams of a certain amount. "
Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer, the insane cry from a bridge from the personality from Munich, so that his response to deep into the night of the 20th century on his literary way out hallte. He made in during a journey which he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the Anflehte posterity.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day they, and Bettete: My God, I would ask you to do everything in your power to ensure that I am leaving, as a woman to write."

On Virginia Wolf: "in her luggage, she had their depression.

On PÃ­o Baroja: "What made-Santos because otherwise, than to try to Joyce in Baroja?

What made Cela because, apart from the glory of the man to destroy, so that he can put on this pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our city in the town of Fuenlabrada last week, suddenly, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years to their and our dog Herliefen, our dog is a mischling, we have taken from the animal sanctuary and just six kilos, and then out of the blue missed him two fußtritte and injured him so difficult.
Our outrage, one can never be in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which is to be, of course, on the leash.
In addition to the attack, a woman who was walking, wanted to see these people as a result of the incident, they even feared for their own lives, because if that attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet areas at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has the all day long.
Of course, we have, in a police complaint, however, we have serious doubts about whether this will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal, an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (FESVIAL) a campaign to promote the use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the use, because it is ultimately the only element, the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in relation to the road safety, "far more than just the design and manufacture of products, with every day," and confirmed that they also with other actions educational and informative nature to contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the use on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan' To Be or Not to be' is, in a first phase will distribute posters to about 500 workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread.
Finally, Michelin, stressed that the Road Safety "is a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they are manufacturers of tyres for two-rädige vehicles are obliged to see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of trucks is rising again
After almost two years of the car market for small trucks finally to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with great caution, because the comparison data used in November 2008, which is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the rise in the last month, the total of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles were sold in this number, but all vehicles, from which the market is: Descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, it is still the same storm clouds in the sky, the demand in the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles will be purchased by individuals, the of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
It is to these restrictions, which are the result of the tap of credit institutions, are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation, and unlike the cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000 E little help.
This plan, however, is not only for individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if they are a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2, must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded that it is on the part of the state, also a special attention to this and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association predicts for the year 2010, a similar year as the last, for which it is with a sales (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As the abs and it is happening now with the stability control, the systems on the brakes in emergency must be a duty in European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles, a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of the fuβgänger, but these braking systems, because of their operation can also help to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking system, on the basis of the drivers on the brake pedal.
However, this system is not this pressure until the end.
According to one of the components for the Bosch-commissioned study, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the, no longer on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against, with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the time and therefore also the distance, a car in the back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1.100 fatal accidents, which come to come, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of assistants.
It would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that one in every four accident involving personal injury could be prevented, as soon as the so-called intelligent systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) Obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, there is a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, him in the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the collision is inevitable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors, the plan for Opel until January
While the Workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to point out that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, to ensure that the affected side their assent to every point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and then there are the governments of the countries in which it works, will be presented until the beginning of 2010.
The assurance from GM that it will take in the next few days, a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car industry, so that this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM is to, with a number of potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports cars, which the Russian group converg backing, ever stronger.
If it with any of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close at the end of the year, Saab, if it has not been sold by then, will also continue to maintain.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilos.
In order to create something, they from the first on the automatic aufklappbare roof, has been replaced by a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem drive, so that alone has saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum used in this model, as the GT3 "disappear" A further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning, 13; it has reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so were saved another 7 kilo; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet-seats again 12 and with the light 19--Felgen again five.
Then we had also through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of türgriffe Griffe from substance by the lack of a kilo.
Although he also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test with a vehicle with 6-hand carried out, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes, which are really very kurvig.
During his driving behaviour can only give him the note.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is now no longer so sure would be on the streets.
It is, rather, the opposite is the case: since long, we have no longer a small and easy model, a but also a sense of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to make his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to warm, until we give him the orders, to slow to recover and then again everything from his engine to get out ...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its control, which is just as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and it can increase with the' Sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already the Panamera used for the first time.
The acceleration is brutal, whether from the foot or re-acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was quite damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps.
The electronic assistants had on the whole route almost nothing at all to do; and that, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which has an indescribable Fahrspass, as otherwise it is rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and 70.831 euro.
Bag girl'
The singer, a friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco cocoon and a gelegenheitsstarlett in the fashion of'', they presented their evil face with the same as their pockets of Chanel.

The team from Vitoria, the significant loss of Mann, Oleson, Huertas or micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they wait until the bitter end to their victory.

Already began to, as the best of his team with 13 points, including the "minus six" assessment of the can already guess that this would not be the best night of Brazilian.
Nevertheless, it was the game, despite the clear advantage in the break is not yet decided and the Makkabäer wanted to remind you once again that on the pitch, not everyone wins, and thanks to the "hand of Elías" They came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed to the "yellow" The Umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get back in the air and one of them the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three successive times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that Einberuhigender has been on the table of again by (54-67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesen were in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) has already announced that it would allow anyone to them the victory they honestly earned in the first 30 minutes, taking away again.
Nevertheless, resigned pnini and Eidson, not the best of their team and tried to give their team by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and despite the cluster because fouls was the place, not the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis in the last minute aufholten (80-85), the game had already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter of the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Ereins Unicaja, even if the local team with a game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the plaque in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favour, the minute, in which it of an action almost to the brawl between the two Americans would Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.

Thank you!
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which in any case is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The used to stabilize the markets, it was to pay off the debt with the purchase of assets and indirectly to the liquidity to free hand in interest rates, which move to zero, so that in this way the banks assets to buy.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already with its annual auction, the next week.
That is why the investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The flüchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in the corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the normal amounts, they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the euro area countries in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now affected by this episode of instability, but then came the Standard &amp; Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
A degree of uncertainty on the other hand, is not to the defenders of the moral hazard to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world's economic policy an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects, which the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have a new day for the action.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren, to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously anticipated.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which is on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non-fulfilment of their payments and therefore a euro member country, no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to its citizens in need of measures with the duty to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are as expected from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some to large sums of money, it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of public debt at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, the European differences and reduce the Spanish to increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor's is a farce. While the early indicators of a of the market research institutes, their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 to correct, the OCDE and the European Commission to come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, despite all the warnings of a long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment, "caution when driving" is the order of the day.
Associated Industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where in recent days, the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed, Galán the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind the doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain to invest 50 billion by 2020 further 60 billion by 2030 from that date, under the fact that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment would not to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should invest more in an increase in production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it is estimated that 18,000 mw more will be needed, under the course by other "energy."
Galán, is of the opinion that the gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, not to say anything in any case against this law, to create incentives for the national coal consumption, which is exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "it is clear in this direction in the long term, despite some" individual ", as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Galán, that is the decisions on the investment, even if they are in the long term, should make, because it will take some time and a stable framework must be created in order to tackle them.

Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues at his first construction of motorways in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are represented as energy and water companies.
The building, which it is, is a tunnel, which will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German universities are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and operators.
The city government would have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for a public-private partnership (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to for the project after a business plan drawn up by Ernst &amp; Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and administration.

The group with the city is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction company of Australia, while the second, based in Italy, one of the best specialists in Tiefbau.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium northern direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian field, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French group Bouygues.

The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction and privatisations, however, has a hurdle to overcome, because it is only through the purchase of a local access.
A strategy of the companies deep or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian credentials, followed by the Spanish baugiganten still needs to be pursued.
Even ACS has in this market only through his participation of 30% of high-low, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton, access.
Millions in assets
Acciona is on the geographical area of the utmost importance to the industry, in which it already because of his work as an energy supplier and in the industry is very well known.
Among other assets it has already his Gröβten park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the Group of Companies, which has been charged with the desalination plant in Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million to build and to manage.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies in order to gain access to the construction and infrastructure.
The underground route, by the Office for Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and Northern Link (feeder), has the purpose, the western motorway in toowong with the umgehungstraβe in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 miles through tunnels. It is the gröβte measure to reduce congestion on the streets of Brisbane.
The city government spent the roadmap for the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll already for traffic in recent months to open by 2014, the assumption is that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was drafted in 2005.
He has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex system.

The game in the Champions League, Madrid and Barça since the beginning, 4 million.
The Champions League has since its creation in 1992 to a source of income for the fuβballclubsentwickelt.

So a fuβballclub gets at least 1 million and a maximum of 2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned with his victory in the European Supercup in August 2.5 million.
However, the variable payments, for the, 8 million.
This money is proportional to the value of each individual market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has allocated 4 seats.
