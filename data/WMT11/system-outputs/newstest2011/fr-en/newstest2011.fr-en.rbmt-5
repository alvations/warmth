What is what it will occur? CS knows neither Voldemort nor of pastry making in Prague.
The new elected officials of CSSD to the town hall of the capital will have apparently to surmount a real linguistic barrier to include themselves/understand on the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The Actualne.cz daily newspaper "tested" the novel members of the municipal council pertaining to CS, namely if they know the slang which was born during the last years with the town hall, when they was the partners of the current coalition who directed to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague started during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise which it was discovered that the new elected officials do not include/understand the known terms very well.
At least they say it.
"Which is Valdemort."
"I really do not know."
"I am a young fellow in the policy pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected official with the culture with the test of the vocabulary of the" parrain."
And concerning the political veteran, the elected official Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the direction of "hole of golf."
"It is the only expression among those which you propose to me that I use"
If not, I do not use the slang.
Vocabulary, of which the Aktualne.cz daily newspaper published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-éĺectoral congress of the ODS, the drafting chose 6 examples, in priority those which are dependent with the town hall of Prague.
The Socialists were to explain the direction of "Voldemort," "the largest hole of golf in Prague," to go to pastry making ,"" ox nerve ,"" treason of the capital "and" entôler."
Three of the elected officials were of agreement for the quiz, fourth Antonin Weinert, which must direct education to Prague in the future - promised a maintenance first of all but then the telephone did not take down.
The fifth elected official Petr Dolinek straightforwardly refused the test.
"I do not deal at all with these things there and how the representatives of the democracy citizen have fun: I will not deliver my opinion."
"I currently deal with the way in which we will include ourselves/understand within the framework of our programs," T it has reacted.
As one already heard, the elected official Lukas Kaucky apparently does not recognize in the legend above, that it is about influential Janousek on the contractors and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does not say anything á' Kaucky and the only expression which he guessed in the test is "the largest hole of golf in Prague."
"It is about the Blanka tunnel" says Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know it newspapers."
"I will have to pay me a language class," joke T it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but as Lukas Plachy, the elected official for the environment, know as the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where to find the character - he thinks within the meaning of "going to pastry making."
"It acts, I think, to go in a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is about the seat of the companies of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls as it rather draws its knowledge from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary which it would use.
According to the candidates with the tests there does not exist any lexicon of slang in the social democracy.
"I took council with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have something of this type."
"One rather says the names some time one uses abbreviations and symbols," known as Peter Hlinsky, President of the Party socio-democrat, that the members of the Party call Hulda.
" Me was called Briza at the school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, acknowledges Karel Brezina in connection with the nicknames.
The Actuel.cz daily newspaper tested the name and it goes.
The Weinert elected official is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old woman, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew the attention to him before the elections by the swindles during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small toy."
The nicknames are also the only ones which inside the party the social democrats admit to employ.
It appears that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the Akutel.cz daily newspaper recorded another nickname for this president pragois.
"Doctor in right of bludgeon" recalls appears it that Petr Hulinsky obtained its title of doctor in right JUDr. with the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to decrease tortures of the "witches," published a booklet.
To Burkina Faso, the declared women witch refer common.
They form part of the older generation rather, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and do not have a child.
That which becomes "witch" is insulated not to threaten the remainder of the village.
"The man very seldom has this destiny."
"One does not judge either the young women in good health because they take part in work and are confined of the children," declares a sister who occupies herself in the capital of this country of Western Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who were rejected by the company.
The local government decided to intervene against these unusual "social measures."
It published a booklet which should help has to limit hunting to the witches.
The business comprises "difficulty."
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," informed the daily newspaper Die Standard in connection with the disadvantage of written education.
The charge of sorcery is current in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, close to Burkina Faso, Am Hemma, woman a 72 year old died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled to him.
It is the waiter of the BBC which transmitted this information.
The criminals affirm that it was about the evil eye.
According to their version the oil which is used for ritual oilings is emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil flamed, appears it, when the team wanted "to drive out the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of the "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
Standard daily newspaper DER quoted a 42 year old contractor of Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human spirits always represented a danger," said it.
Whereas Burkina Faso endeavours to reduce hunting to the witches, Gambia not later that last year even saw the President himself taking part in it.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad hunting to the witches which, appears it, would have taken part in its death and would have endeavoured by the black magic to also kill the President."
"Of the Shamans of Guinea come near to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm with Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and of the personal guard of the President, the men and the women chosen randomly in villages of Gambia," in a message the organization " indicated; Amnesty International.
With the farm the imprisoned people were to drink a potion containing plants with the hallucinogens effects which caused in addition to other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive it.
On the international pressure it is approximately a thousand of people who were given in freedom.
The tenant of Bakal: The poèles heat, it signed a rent more raised.
An imposing old man left by the door the center customers the company RPG Byty the "baron coal" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to be rented as a Czech Republic.
It carried under the arm a file with three new agreements of hiring for three apartments: his, that of his/her daughter and her son who is spirit to purge a sorrow.
The deregulation made increase the rent with these three people.
Instead of paying the 3500 sons will have to regulate as from the next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no warm water and the heating runs on solid fuel," shows to finger on the new agreement of his/her son the man who has the capacity of signature.
"But I signed nevertheless" explains T it with motié in anger and half resigned.
The association citizen of the BytyOKD.cz apartments which described the nouelles conditions of hiring like "immoral and indecent," advises with the tenants not to until December 7 sign and wait, date on which will be published a note to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to that by an epic of the hand.
"One says that, the other says another thing" by wrinkling the eyebrows.
The area of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of the deregulation.
After the New year, it is what awaits the majority of the apartment as a Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory personally."
The waiting room of RPG in the street Havirovska is one of the four of the area of Ostrava and it is already full Tuesday at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Just beside the door a guard is held of a company of safety with an apparatus to call the customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lit on the touchscreen.
Only one pressure and a paper with a number leaves the apparatus.
You do not have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to be illuminated on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it is your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple is able to get information about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to regulate current problems like everywhere - request for repairs, events concerning the insurances and others.
In the area of Ostrava, people of more than 44000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG receive the mails with the new agreements of lease in their letter-box since approximately mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to them increases in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special counter for the new rents is opened with the public since November 18.
"it functions since nearly one week, it is thus still with the test" answers, after one moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the customer is presented in the form of a journalist.
The deragulation and the old apartments of minors of Bakal are a very significant local subject.
The vice-president of the Parliament and originating in the area of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the social democrats in made state in a rather constant way before the elections and that fills from now on the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
" They did not even change me one could... N of board in the WC, relieve in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is especially, according to the employees, of reprocessed who come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of the rent if they sign now like promised it RPG in an special offer.
It is a rebate of half of the amount of the rent which the others will receive loctaires which will have signed their new agreement before December 15.
But the counter "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska is really not overpowered by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," indicates the employee to the counter.
And yet RPG porpose so much on its Web site than in the windows of the individual talks on the rents when it is necessary.
If the two parts do not get along on the rent it is an independent court which will make the decision.
'It is not a question of threats but to only inform on the single way and legitimates to act légalement" , RPG indicates on its Web site.
"Here nobody will go to the court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the center of customers gives him reason.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and there remain to me 5000 crowns to eat, I do not have to go enough to the court," known as it.
The employee feels suddenly badly at ease.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that nobody sign and thus the people wait," indicates T it.
The regulation of the rents finishes as a Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the funds for the residences," points out Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the funds for the residences which returns the tenant in anger is the primary reason of the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years of 2011 has 2014 that should make 5.2 billion.
The big screen fixed on the ceiling opposite the stuffed armchairs of the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, however repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in the rent in 2011 is of 15 percent and does not concern less than 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments of RPG."
"And it will be always with more the 7.50 Czech crowns the m ² per month," indicates the screen.
The increase of 38 percent relates to only 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases there, it is about an increase in a sum really very low 19.66 Czech crowns with the m ²," adds RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same one for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase on 4 to 8 years.
She adds other engagements: all the money of the increase in the rents (cf the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings in heating - news windows and heating.
Those which sign the agreement on the increase in rent have the priority.
The nursery school forms part, it also, of the offices included/understood the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new seat of company arch. Design.
Nobody could have expected that it also shelters a mini nursery school with all that it is necessary - walls of colors, pieces of furniture imaginative, toys and finally a miniature playing field on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can go there the children of the employees of arch. design.
The company of project-architectonic arch. Design. whose workshops produced a great number of constructions with Brno, its mini nursery school of company imagined since the first outlines of the Avriopoint building.
It employs approximately 90 people, especially of the age to make children and it mattered to him that the women architects and project managers can quickly return to work.
At the same time as of the work contracts at decreased time, the nursery school is a no-claims bonus suggested with its employees by company arch. Design. within the framework of its social program.
The manufacturers and the architects thus have the possibility of combining a fascinating work with the care for the children.
They are the employees thesame ones who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they could obtain an equipment of the European Union and Ministry of Labour and social affairs.
The mini nursery school is financed by the means of the Funds of a company European through the operational program of human resources and the official Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the equipments of financing (with height of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They could buy equipment and apparatuses and after two years to ensure a qualified personnel as well as the startup.
After the use of the equipment of financing (two years) company arch. Design. with the obligation after 3 years to make function to it mini nursery school on its equities.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it is the company Economy rating which helped to make the request for equipment.
The care with the children is ensured by a qualified personnel, all the day a nurse and a teacher of nursery school deals with the children. the children can go to the nursery school without limitation of age but they have more than three anspour the majority.
As there is about a "mini nursery school" he can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there is more who are replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible the needs of the parents and the children of all the employees have the same right to use this school without glance on the hierarchical position.
Although it is about an individual care and an education, the program of the mini nursery school is comparable with that for pre-school education.
The children do not make there that to play but a teaching of quality is also assured there - beginning until the preparation with the benches of school one teaches English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and plays but also with a computer which the children can use.
The presence of the small children in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
The parents can at any time to control their child and not to have the stress of a delay to go to seek the children in a school far away from the work place of the parents.
The parents thus use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not astonishing that creates for itself a natural relation of honesty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s' is thus registered among the companies which offer a no-claims bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly towards the family and through this program the marketing of RH reinforces.
The house in bone fascine still after 100 years. Throw an eye in the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurien, the staircase with a spinal column of dinosaur and the balconies with open fish mouths.
Thus is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received on behalf of the buildings the nickname of House in bone.
Organic forms, colors wild, use unusual of stones, fragments of squares and mosaîque, frontage pointing out of the scales and everywhere present curves, here all that is ypic for the Art nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal frontage of the house unrolls its lines of dream, its pleasant colors and textures which point out nature and the animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rate/rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the frontage of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced with it.
The rolling up and the torsion of the forms also appear in the interiors with same measurement.
Wood copies in waves the windowframes, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the plates.
The Battlo house which is drawn up in the Eixample district in the commercial street Passeig de Gracia with the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala the Cortes.
The rebuilding was done during two years and the house finished in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich person contractor, insisted initially on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another any news but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi of the unusual rebuilding and cheaper.
But the idea of Put Battlo as an apartment building was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that were born decorations for an apartment from representation of the owner of the building and the use of mosaîque for the frontage.
For the frontage also worked of other artists and creators.
Common work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo begin with a co-operation with success between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol took part in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The buildings called the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "the House in bone."
Others, have regard to the specific mechanism of opening of the windows called it "the house which bucket."
It is said that in top construction there is a sword similar to that of Georges Saint the owner of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of construction contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the house a single system in its central warming-up time, with vents of ventilation and typical chimneys.
Their slope of 45 degrees seems odd.
During Gaudi creation absolutely did not respect the directives of construction of then and did not let itself block by them.
At the beginning of construction it obtained on behalf of the city it allowed to build, knowing, of course that the data related to the plans of rebuilding were so vague that two years afterwards during the completion the municipal council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It did not like, for example, with the members of the municipal council which the pillars of construction empiettent on the public pavement.
There was never modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked for (and satisfaction obtained) the authorization of rent the two higher stages.
The owner moved on the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room common and to the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented with a jewellery.
The whole house of six floors is divided by a staircase by which one reaches to an independent terrace of roof.
All the right angles and the straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the rebuilding and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of connection of spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or to limit the space deprived for more intimate talks.
The house with the rebuilding of Gaudi received in addition to new frontages a nontraditional roof and two stages moreover.
The play of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, of the blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the interior court and with the wells of lights.
The play with two colors gives a maximum of light in all the floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than sinks it which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Put Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the Funds of the World heritage of UNESCO perhaps visited by each one.
On the first floor of the house is the most roomy apartment and most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners decided to cross this step in 2002 at the time of the 150ème birthday of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they noted that it is about a lucrative company and they widened the field of the visits to common spaces and the attic including the terraces of roof.
The ticket of entry in the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros; the students, the pensioners, the groups and the tourist holders of charts have 20 percent of reduction.
The sum is nevertheless above the entrance fee in other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a diagrid: the women have other criteria that the men.
No the ostentatious framework, but rather surface quality reserved for sleeping, therefore the mattress and the diagrid give a real base for a good bed.
Must of course be complementary harmoniously to like them a concrete user.
During the choice several things are determining: the weight, size, the age, the health condition as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which one will place the mattress and the diagrid is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously the latex mattresses are not suitable because they "are heated" gently.
They have, in addition, a weight higher than the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to frequently turn over them.
If they also do not have enough ventilating ducts in the middle and if they remain, moreover, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can be also formed there.
The practice is also determining in the choice.
That which passes the light of time abroad when one frequently uses very thick mattresses with a softening layer, will feel of course with difficulty a low and hard surface.
"Thus all the hokeyists who return from NHL feel sorry for that they cannot sleep over there."
"For their tired shoulders, the feet and the coasts, they needed mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for the people who suffer from diabetes which has a disorder of the nervous system which thus badly assumes" information "of the articulations and the skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova which specializes in the stuffed pieces of furniture.
Therefore there is a few years the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
" Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to be able to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" functions simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and its form according to absorptive heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing makes pressure on you and you will not be turned over in the night as after a difficult match.
You sleep simply better.
Lazy foam also functions like a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, that is to say approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm thus need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimal width for each one for a bed in two places should be 90 cm is in all 180 cm.
For the beds in only one place, the individual ones for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in the event of visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should pose the hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of the Harness-maker-mattress makers and decorators who has devoted themselves for several years to the problems of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and the sign in the specialized schools.
For a bed in two places each one has need for its own diagrid and mattress, therefore attention however during achât to choose the height of the mattress well.
If not it will only remain you to assemble the diagrid to various heights and that is not realizable on all the executives of bed.
The mattresses foam should have a minimal height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of that count for the ventilation and subgrade at least three centimetres.
"With the touch or in sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well defined type of diagrid.
The read-diagrid, when the mattress and the diagrid are plain like Siamese twins, does not have anything to make in the rooms sleep.
The mattresses are aired very badly; one should not wash it, which is usually made auhourd' today.
And since during the night one perspires normally from 0.2 to 0.75 L of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to point out a large (and stopped) sieve.
For that the specialists refuse to make advertisement over one 25 years lifespan of for a mattress or a guarantee with life.
But very with its but.
And for this reason a council of experiment on behalf of the salesmen: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to hygiene or washing but add a mattress of protection rather that easily vouspouvez to withdraw and wash.
And even if nowadays it is frequent to manufacture coatings with zipper for all the unit, i.e. that after the opening one has two parts (for the washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) if not handling for the great models (and only one person) becomes when one withdraws them a combat between a light weight and a heavy lorry on a boxing ring.
You have in your bed a rigid board instead of a diagrid?
Never!
To the maximum for a bed intended for the visitors for only one night.
However equip the board (if there is not) air vents and use the spring mattress with a minimal height of 15cm with springs out of sachets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not belong to a bed of this type.
For the diagrids with plates with single position with 14/18 plates, the latex mattresses or known as sandwiches (perhaps combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but will be always better for you to have a mattress with more plates, 28 and above, where the plates are doubled in the part of the bottom of the kidneys and that it is thus possible to control rigidity of it.
For the mattresses with several positions one should not take spring mattress because it does not answer the changes of position.
Beside the adjustment of the rigidity of the plates one can also install what one calls a cradle of shoulder.
It is about a special connection of the plates which makes it possible to make pressure even incline the plate so that the shoulder of the sleeper "is integrated" well.
For the men who have "the shoulders as broad as the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses which for the "masculines" started to use a zone softening on the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of the women - they again offer to them a softer surface on the level of the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are diagrids with wings or plates with what one calls a suspension multiforce.
The pressure is disseminated in more points and diinue the tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and diagrid, "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The size recommended is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When one is lengthened on the side, the pillow must level (with the cradle of shoulder of the diagrid or the zone softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses still have something of commun run with the first containing straw and of grass.
The manufacturers still use natural matters or many mixtures.
The tendency is also with the mattress bio.
The raw materials containing oil, from which the polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as for example of the soya oil.
Almost all the known manufacturers precisely use soya.
"The Bio qualifier for the mattresses means that the heart is manufactured containing natural products," Petr vasicek company Tropico Plus explains.
The natural matters are also used for the coatings of the mattresses; one of the first was the aloe will vera.
But you can add to it microphone-capsules which develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There exist differences between the man and the woman.
Whereas the extract of plants of birch so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "kills" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is thus hotter for the weaker sex.
The preferred current ones?
The mattresses manufactured starting from cold foam (it have more pores with a thus disturbed cellular structure more breathing that the standard polyurethane and have more elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foams gives mattresses polyzones which know precisely where is the head, the bottom of the back and the feet.
You will pay a mattress of quality starting from 7000 crowns and more.
Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
As a Czech Republic, it is Gumotex which reached the first place.
To save for the mattress and the diagrid is not simple.
One can from time to time have within the framework of special actions on behalf of the manufacturers or the producers two mattresses for the price of only one.
As for example the Magniflex company which proposes Duofreeze mattresses with foam with Memory memory bent with the coating for 11990 crowns.
One can obviously take the second free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a great thickness was started with the Tempur matter at "cosmic" intervals.
That started as matter for NASA because the astronauts underwent with the starting of the enormous load factors.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens, on the contrary, cold.
It thus adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes to him an optimal pressure.
It is for that ideal against the evil slept and for an increase in comfort during the sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for the mattresses but also for the products for health, as the special cushions for the feet which relieve the venous legs and system.
The Czech manufacturers use for example foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type.
The apparatuses to follow people are required more and more by the parents who wish to supervise their children.
The fear for their child leads people more and more to think of supervising them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to seek the cars can just as easily be employed to trace the movement of the people and to help for certain cases as by exmple that of small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as one limps of matches but will be soon of the size of a watch.
The case of small Anicka moved a great number of people and they started to seek the means of better protecting their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private life.
"We endeavour to say to all which it is not a question of espionage but only of another means to decrease the probability that there is another tragedy," declares Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil which is one of the suppliers of apparatuses of tracing on the Czech market.
"I acknowledge that there can be cases of bad use of such apparatuses, as for example to put it in the bag of a person who is not with the current, but I did not encounter such cases yet."
" The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for safety reasons, adds Pilin.
According to him the children should always know at which ends is used "limps it" and how to use it in the event of urgency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws the attention that if the child does not want to carry on him a thing of this type, it will be débarassera some.
'And even smallest can show a great creativity when it is a question of getting rid purposely of something when they do not want to be under contrôle."
"The cellphones, which can be cut like these apparatuses of tracing, already brought the parents to long delays," affirms Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of apparatus can help in the event of aggression is very debatable.
"If it is about a prepared abduction, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device which can locate it."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as will develop the equipment of tracing, they (criminals) will also seek them them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will be always advances of it on the police force," known as the psychologist.
She acknowledges all the same that such apparatuses can help at the time of an aggression not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which proposes services of tracing as well for the cars as for the people, affirms to have this type of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an aggression.
"The apparatus can be parameterized in such a way that it is in regular emission after one given period."
"If the apparatus is destroyed, there remains all the same the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive apparatuses also have an inclinometer which immediately announces the position of the person who slipped and is found in reclining position without bouger" , Cech indicates.
According to him the cellphones known as intelligent which are equipped with a navigation system, can propose a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologiciel.
The problem of the current systems of tracing is that it acts is of an apparatus similar to those which one carries into pendentive of the size of one limps of matches is with the more telephone small apparatuses.
One can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently carried out to make apparatuses which resemble common numerical watches.
"That will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the apparatus of tracing."
"Or it will realize there after a certain time, which will have given to the police force a little more time," he adds.
That the apparatus of tracing is developed in the shape of bracelet or pendentive, it will always utilisiera same technology as to trace cars.
It is about a combination of systems of acquisition of a position by means of the GPS (which is usually used in autonavigation) and of a function of a cellphone which alerts the current location of a vehicle.
The army has as well detonator fuses as it could make it tower of the Czech Republic with. But it can hold only two years.
The army bought for 445 km of chalk lines used for the explosives.
Already last year the Ministry for Defense had bought 224 km of them.
The army thus has concerning 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the chalk lines is from two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonator fuses at public limit company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general staff gave as reason of achât of an enormous quantity of detonator fuses to MF DNES which the soldiers use 60 km per annum.
According to calculations of reserve to be held made by the pyrotechnists of the army, that MF DNES contacted, this reveals that even the generals, the officers having a command, secretaries or the personnel of household should have each year a exercise with the explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister for defense and Vlastimil Picek, ordering army do not make exception.
Only to argue the yearly consumption of the army of 60 km detonator fuses.
With this distance corresponds 25.000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the reserves of the army could provide for it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic drive of each new professional it is enough with more than 2 m of detonator fuses, as the experts say it, that means that the army with its new purchase ensured - with also the consumption of the special units and the genius - concerning the 225 years mentioned.
However the soldiers of the brigade of rapid intervention recently complained with the Vondra Minister whom they almost do not have ammunition for their handguns and whom the meetings of shooting are limited because of the needs for money.
In connection with the lack of body linen one does not speak about it.
"And I am not caught the head if they on our premises buy a so great quantity of detonator fuses."
"And it is their decision and they know really what they do."
"for us the army is a good customer that we endeavour as tradesmen to satisfy," known as the business manager of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry for defense, argues achât it of hundreds of km of detonator fuses by the fact that the army will have these "ammunition" reserves some for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group makes state however only four years of lifespan of the detonator fuses and the pyrotechnists of the police force and army of only two years.
"If they are stored perfectly in the deposits, that can go even up to four years," said one two which does not want that its name is published have regard to the criticism of the army.
The time of lifespan passed, each ammunition must be tested to see whether it remains just and the life does not threaten of the soldier.
These tests are however not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of cordeux explosives.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the supply of the last year of 245 km," indicates the Pejsek spokesperson who is made the interpreter of the opinion of the purchasers of the ministry for defense.
To only compare: the yearly consumption of the detonator fuses of the pyrotechnists of the police force who neutralize the ammunition of the second world war or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed the 1500 meters.
And organizes it order always only the quantity necessary of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
That was established for safety reasons of the pyrotechnists and to be able moreover to obtain in a more flexible way of the types of more modern and more reliable detonator fuses.
the ministry for defense has today big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition coming from time from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovakian army of two hundred and thousand men prepared to move, course on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonator fuses which it buys today "at a cheap rate."
Until today I benefit from contacts which I obtained thanks to the contests.
The sale under frankness from its hotel helped well Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the contest of best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the contest of best individual Entrepreneur for the last year was Lukas Pytloun, contractor 28 year old.
Its adventure towards success is as in a film.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, it realized that in Libérec it missed a site of lodging of quality at a reasonable price.
Of its economies on what it had gained when it worked abroad and with the assistance of a bank loan it bought a small demolished building of 5 apartments to half.
Knowing that it was still student in trosième year of higher learning, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a lodging in our area gave me desire for doing something," known as Lucas Pytloun.
It started has to rent the first apartment rebuilt with the foreign workmen.
It reinvests the benefit in the building which it transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since this moment, its action of contractor enabled him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a full capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of lodging.
Most comfortable of them was to very recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it him arrived from there another of identical quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel with Ostrova U Stokes where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates with the frankness from the Pytloun hotels appeared," number 1 of the contractors of the last year.
" And for the sale of the licence for the starting of a hotel with large scales the victory with the contest of the contractor of the year was useful well, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought more popularity to him and to be known with Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends the participation in this contest to all those which endeavour to do something.
It is not necessary to gain but any opportunity of being visible is good.
He says that he uses until today his contacts and knowledge which he could not have obtained in another way.
" With those which I met thanks to the contest I started to maintain the commercial relations regularly.
According to him, the fame related to success had an impact also on the employees.
And it has approximately 70 of them.
"I on their premises observe especially honesty and the pride to be itself committed in something which was in general recognized."
" It is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us all together.
"Only my name is ahead thorough," known as Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish with my successor a better year than that which we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of the victory rpidement was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the direction of the objective of gaining Farmet has the worst moments behind oneself.
That which came to seek the price with Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a workshop of tools with Ceska Skalice into a firm with the turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward encouraged not to only me my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight against the concurrence" , declares today gaining it of the contest of last year.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something of useful.
And thus when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop like compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the Communists, he did not hesitate a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic bath-tubs.
Not very a long time after they started to specialize in the presses for plant oil.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the public not specialized after the success obtained with the contest through the media.
"Not only our customers started with really better knowing the Farmet mark but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they collaborated with a company which obtained greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year E did not occur to Farmet only ldans the euphoria from the victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made starting from the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machines of engineering.
With highest of the crisis, which did not really touch the citizens, the companies were obliged to stop their investment plans and to start to limit their achâts new materials and technologies.
"We do not have obviously escaped with this situation."
"The turnovers fell from 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and to even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable company must know that from time to time should be taken unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and preserved bénéficiares results even if they were lower than those which they had before the crisis.
However in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in the research and the development.
"We built with the equipments a training centre and with research, reinforced the presentation of the company in living room-exposures international and gained the principal rewards in the national exposures," known as Zdarsky.
All leaves us think that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires go up and with them the number of employees also.
"With the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of the victory but in a calm atmosphere," known as Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes foolish payments.
The investigation into the Nonsense of the year is for the fourth time part of the clan of the businesses.
Certain absurd regulations could be removed.
The victorious glorious not very of this year of the investigation into the Nonsense of the year was the obligation to bring in the offices of the documents which the civils servant can obtain on-line.
More of the third of the 4000 voters voted for that.
For example, the administrations of the social affairs required an extract paper of the trade register whereas the civil servant can obtain it in two clicks of a mouse.
that changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of the Social Security will not require any more the extract of the trade register for controls of payments of the insurance," indicated Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Administration of the Social Security (CSSZ).
To emphasize all the payments and decrees which the companies and the contractors must fill as a Czech Republic and make remove those which are absurd is the direction of this contest of the Nonsense of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time part of the clan of the businesses organized by Hospodarske noviny and still has a greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters appeared, they is at least 4000 this year who brought their voice.
And it is not astonishing, it ya in our country the most various legal requirements which do nothing but slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
"We are perhaps with the number of documents to be filled for the tax declarations in the first places in the world," declares Karel Havlicek of the Association of the small and medium-size companies and the contractors of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the activity of contractor becomes a goal proclaimed of all the governments these last years.
In comparison with the whole world the situation as a Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is located at the 74 ème place concerning the conditions for the company, that is to say 8 places moreover compared to last year.
The contest of the Nonsense of the year was set up for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
No matter who can make state each year of the administrative and bureaucratic nonsenses from April at the end of September, final deadline before the contest closure.
To return account it ya the Web site www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for "the antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on the www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita site and www.ihned.cz.
The Nonsense which received the greatest number of voices is declared victorious.
Until the last investigation of last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 payments and decrees which lost their direction of existence.
The remarks are sent by the contractors but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the "finalists" of the contest, therefore among the nominated ones for example the obligation is that the vehicles of maintenance of the motorways and the fast tracks pay tolls, or although the contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the site of the contest.
The proclamation of the contest, which always starts at the beginning of November on the Venceslas Place in Prague, is part of a happening in which take part regularly of the personalities of the political life and public.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of Association for the small and medium-size companies of Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of commerce of Czech Republic, attended the culminating moment of the contest.
'Economic prosperity cannot function when the State puts âtons in the legs of the contractors and for this reason my objective is to remove, each year, at least three tens of paragraphs which today do nothing but complicate the entreprise" , with declared Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a blow of sword in water.
In 2007, which people did not like was the obligation of the contractors to declare three days front at the office for the individual business at the place where is the company, the intention to go to an exposure or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Law on the individual business.
The second obligation most voted by plebiscite in 2007, which was to declare at the Office of work a voyage of service for a foreign employee over 30 days, was removed with the legal text on what one calls the green chart.
And all is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Nonsense of the year 2009 was the decree for the physiotherapeutists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two patent weighing machines.
That was changed by ordinance of the ministry for health the year last-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards the responsible firms socially.
Are evaluated the projects ecological, humane, of formation or sportsmen.
The innovation of this year of the contest of Hospodarske Noviny, which already has existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif one of this contest is the support for the company reasonable and right.
"We want to support the companies which supervise the impacts of their company on the environment and undertake a socially responsible activity," Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the operator of cellphone indicates, the Vodaphone firm, which is the guaranteeing one and promoter of this contest, like in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the contest of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the Vodaphone firm, the companies were registered which do not have success with only one long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each one of them is rich inspirations and an independent article would be to publish.
Although the object of their company is different one from the other one can regard their activity of support and forecast as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, that relates to the handicapped people and the personal problems or of health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for all the Czech Republic example is not the company of prologiciels pragoise And Netera which supports the creation of abstract sporting teams their employees who take part then in many tournaments in various sporting disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Cheer which has been for 17 years the principal contributor at the bottoms of equipment which sponsored handicapped children.
With the fact of dealing with the employees having health issues, one can still quote the old manufacturing plant of paper of Podebrad which employs some more than 70 percent and which, for that, obtained the title of the Responsable firm for the area for central Bohemia and which placed third in the area at the contest of the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a finance company, which gained to have introduced work hours softened and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, wage cutting.
The jury to him déverné the title also because it achête in priority with the Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the close entourage and is concerned with environment.
"We endeavour to recycle as much as possible so that our activity of company and our administration have less environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
company responsible IT Enlogit for the Area of Usti also thinks of the health of its employees and their set up for each laptop a chair and a keyboard ergonomic, encourages their domestic industry and uses the services of catering of a local factory protected for its actions.
"We support moreover the foundation the man in the shade which helps local the Rom community," known as Ondrej Suchy the representative of the company.
With the very last row is, also for its activities, a company of Washing and cleaning of the area of Karlovy Vary, who takes part in the insurance reprocesses his employees in the form of no-claims bonus above the standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transport, the increase in the qualifications and with the leisures," known as Joseph Strapac of the company of construction of bruntal Czasch, winner for the area of Moravie-Silesia.
Were registered automatically in the category company Responsable, all the regional finalists for the contest of the Firm of the year of Vodaphone, which had answered the questionnaires in enclosure of the document for the inscription and had returned it to the organizer before August 15.
The answers badly filled or incomplete in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in string had not answered the questions, they could not take part in the contest of the Responsable firm but were not disqualified" a principal "contest the Firm of the year of Vodaphone."
"The independent inscriptions are not possible because it is about a subcategory of the principal contest of the Firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison& Rose.
The Funds for the Grounds with Plzen, the police force carried out arrests during a public contest
In the building of the Funds for the Grounds with Plzen, the police force anti-corruption carried out arrests these last days.
The detectives passed the shackles to the contractor local and trading in Lubos real estate. G.
This one had endeavoured to precisely handle a public invitation to tender for the payment of a request for restitution in such a way that the ground proposed is obtained by a determined candidate.
This one was to pay in Lubos G. a half million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police force continues a person for offence of initiate within the framework of a public invitation to tender and a concour." for the Pravo newspaper the chief of the Parquet floor of Plzen Antonie Zelena declared, knowing that it is interdict to provide more explanations because the investigation is in hand.
The police officers gave after 12 midnight this 46 year old contractor in freedom.
To know how it could influence a public contest, one can only speculate have regard for if few official informations.
With a question of Pravo, the spokesperson of the Funds of the Grounds Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police officers had really carried out an arrest with Plzen on a separate work place and, this, during the public contest.
" It was about a customer and to in no case of an employee, it specified.
The public contest according to Cerna has like true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of grounds according to the Law on the ground" and is set up when several profit candidates of right appear.
"These people propose, within the framework of the call, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be regulated before the value of the ground is not announced."
"According to the rights suggested a classification of the purchasers is set up and the Funds of the Grounds transfers then the ground to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Funds.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information concerning the people who had been registered with the call and as it is itself, also, a person bénéficiare because having bought a great number of rights to restitutions, it had proposed to the candidates with the ground not to take part in the contest.
And it undoubtedly boxed by the fact of withdrawing itself.
What would explain why it had such an amount of money in its possession at the time of its interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the standards in FdT (Funds of the Grounds).
It appeared in the business of the ex-chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot which was continued with penal to have to publish grounds for which one had already published the decision of installation of a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained for example grounds intended for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and place where was to be built the artery of access to the industrial park of Borske Pole.
Later it exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historical centre of the city whose value is higher by far.
The town hall was obliged to accept because if not it was likely to put construction in danger by a blocking of the grounds.
The households will monthly pay a supplement of a hundred crowns for housing.
The households will have as from January to pay a supplement not only for all the types of energy but also for water and the cleansing, the supplies of heating and with certain places the rents will also increase.
The families will have as from January to thus draw from their porte-monnaie until a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in certain localities you will have to pay until a tenth moreover the supply of water and in many places the supplies of central heating will be also more expensive.
The increase in electricity should annually border for the households in apartment the 100 crowns moreover than currently.
However all the suppliers decreased the prices of electricity being given the significant development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energies, in particular the photovoltaic piles.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and thus have greatest consumption.
One can thus also count a hundred crowns moreover.
Although electricity and the gas increase in all the Czech republic, the change of the price of the central heating differs from city downtown.
In fact mainly the largest communes plan the raising of prices.
For example the households with Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay as from January for the central heating almost 50 crowns moreover per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague an increase of 9 percent for water and the cleansing for the case prepares where the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If the rents do not change the pragois will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still form part of low in comparison with the entire country.
In Bohemia of north, where the prices form already part of highest, water and the cleansing increase by 7.4 percent.
The prices of the rents will increase for example appreciably in the 450 thousand apartments in hiring as from January i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty which has in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those which will not be agreement with the new increase in the rents will be translated in front of the courts by the company.
The controlled rents that people in nearly 300 thousand apartments pay could increase the next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children saoûlent themselves with rum and the fernet. The beer is not any more mode and acts all gently.
The fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way also the best whisky mark are stolen to the parents.
They are drinks which bring generally those which is saoûlent, which is not yet fifteen years old, between the hands of the doctor.
The children who are neat at the hospital for repetition do not make the exception.
That results from the experiment of the doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the departments children of the hospitals.
"The beers or the wines are not any more mode because it takes time to be drunk."
'The tendency is really with alcohols forts" , indicates for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chef of the department children of the hospital of Horovice in central Bohemia.
" When they succeed in bating a dad bottle in the cupboard, it is about sometimes of wisky but it is the fernet and the vodka which prévalent'.
"Vodka has this advantage which they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the Chief of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson of the Motol hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it is rum or fernet."
"It is today alcohol with the mode in particular in the elementary schools."
"In certain cases, it was about slivovice which they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Pélikan department, to see old drunk children from thirteen to fourteen years with the admissions at the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, it was in Motol where it precisely exerted ten years in pediatry where the ambulances brought schoolboys of the broad completely drunk surroundings.
" An young girl was thus hospitalized four times
"It acommencé its career at twelve years when it was brought with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in blood with in more one mixture with extasy," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was with the Exhibition site of Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting, it is that it did not appear odd with the mother that his/her daughter is absent 48 hours" known as astonished the Director by the Department.
It is precisely the satisfying of the parents or their tolerance out of the commun run vis-a-vis the fact that their kids devote themselves to drink who are the main cause of développment of the alcoholism of the children.
According to the specialists, one does not speak however about the dependence, in his strict direction, for the children.
"Under the alcoholic term one hears a chronic dependence with the alcohol of several years with all the phenomena which result from this but that one does not find in the children."
"At those which use the acool with repetition, it is rather about a socio-family background significantly unfavourable," explained the Head of Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesperson, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the private clinic of pediatry in Motol.
Are integrated in stastistic only the cases with a grâve intoxication requiring the hospitalization.
The drunk children who are after the care urgently brought back on their premises by the parents or the police force, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of the children who have themselves and drink an alcohol bottle after the school, it exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves which one can take into account: the day of the witches, it holy Sylvestre and school end of the year.
"Either they drink by spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I lived at the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children of only one blow," underlined Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night to the hospital in desintoxciation under medical control is paradoxically in better position than that which returned at his place and suffers the following day from the "hangover."
The headaches of the morning caused by a dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and elements nutritive which the organization needs.
"They for that are parcelled out better since they pass an excellent evening then a soft alarm clock and nothing hurts them."
"They are only astonished by the place where they are," Pélikan knowing adds that from time to time that wastes the good mood of the patients at least with the note to be paid for their care.
Transport by ambulance and the hospitalization on bed of intensive care can go until tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied that as a means of education while counting with these children how much their intoxication cost and than they could spend all the summer in seasonal work to refund only one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the insurance companies of health in their managements in regression, which should recover on behalf of the parents the loads related to the care, do not treat the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 planes of the five in all, against which the Ministry for Defense exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where seat the manufacturer of planes Put-EADS.
It is the first time that apparatuses of this type become the property of someone else that the Czech army.
They however were abroad within the framework of exercises or flights of demonstration.
They are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 which was until now in service in the Czech army and which was in a state of vol.
Lestrois remaining apparatuses are single-seat versions of L-159.
Those station for the moment at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the department of press of the Ministry for defense, the physical departure of the planes of Vodochody is for the unknown moment.
'The planes L-159 single-seaters planned for the exchange were taken on planes stored for a long time without that not causing additional loads or investments for the Ministry for the défense."
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," declared for Pravo Pejsek.
It has tournament which the army will not remain without two-seater since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unutilised L-159 single-seaters in the two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being envisaged with the delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed itself introducing the planes into the equipment of certain countries of Alliance.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that which takes the L-159 planes in account is EADS and which they will be used for the drive of the pilots of Member States of NATO."
"It is consequently the business of that which takes into account to determine how to carry out that," Pejsek indicated.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested by L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a plane Put and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was ratified last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The ministry for defense did not launch an invitation to tender and contacted EADS directly.
the direction of defense argued whereas the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought in Aéro Vodochody 72 apparatuses and does not use any which 24, wanting to sell the remainder.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
the European commission however carried felt sorry for against the Czech ministry of defense near the European Court of justice because the planes should have been selected within the framework of an invitation to tender on a European scale and have in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army already took delivery of three planes Casa, the last should arrive on the airport of Prague Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular one is a weak sign of risk of cancer
The men who have the index longer than the annular one are exposed at the less risk to have a cancer of the prostate.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
That can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is used as simple test of cancer risk of the prostate, in particular for the men before 60 years," proclaimed the joint author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the university of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should subject themselves to the test of the cancer of the prostate, in particular while combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants like the family antecedents of health, added Eeles.
For the period of 1994-2009 it followed with her colleagues to the United Kingdom more than 1500 patients reached of a cancer of the prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular one.
For them as for the 19 percent of those which had the fingers same length, one found the same probability of a cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those which had the index longer than annular the risk however fell to 33 percent, for the men before 60 years the reduction in the risk reached 87 percent.
The report/ratio length of the two quoted fingers - formed for the antenatal period - indicates in particular levels different of sex hormones to which the child in the uterus is exposed.
With less of testosterone corresponds a longer index.
Preceding research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone which development assistance of a cancer of the prostate.
Professor Vacla Paces, famous Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Science, said for CTK which it is with the current of this study but that it does not seem to him, appears it, that the relation between the length of the fingers and cancer "is completely shown."
The Czech Republic is under snow, the motorways D1 and D5 is closed.
Tchéquie as the majority of Europe east this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and the pavements, it there with the majority of the time of compact snow, the déblayeurs worked all during the night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed the morning between the 89ème and the 93ème kilometer in direction of Rozvadov because of several accidents of trucks and cars and the auroute D1 in Brno for Prague undergo the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Car central club (UAMK) said it to information
With the 91ème kilometer a truck was broken, with the 93ème two heavy lorries were struck, the accident made casualties.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway with the 185 ème kilometer for Prague.
Two trucks were struck there
The drivers should leave just after Brno to the 190ème kilometer or go by Brno and enter then to the 182ème kilometer in Kyvalka.
A file of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimetres thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Files of cars are created for example in Prosek, the street Sterboholska is also stopped.
The surest means of transport are the subway.
The trams take delay for example on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the staff of crisis of Prague must still meet.
The railways and the airport also encounter problems.
The Czech Railroads already had to remove because of snow 7 connections of rapids.
The lines for example of Prague with Kralupy or of Prague with Beroun have problems
The travellers should control the current location.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed since Wednesday 11 h00 in the night up to 5 hours of the morning.
Majority of the roads in Moravie of the South east already roulable but by redoubling vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three service roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno there starts to be with places of the gusts of snow and on the road of Blansko the chains are obligatory to pass certain transportation routes in the places placed higher.
The area of Vyskov belonged to the most touched places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
Perhaps to clean them it will be necessary to send the déneigeuses ones and strawberries to snow.
One cannot for the moment estimate when they will be roulables.
On the road of Hodonin prudence is of rigour in the area of Carpathes white.
On the roads which are, have regard to protection of nature, maintained only by sprinkling inert products, there is all the same a layer of 5 centimeters of snow informs CTK.
In Tchéquie, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell more in Bohemia of north, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
Into the area of Moravie-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Snowing up disappears in Tchéquie gradually.
American has a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army sent in Afghnistan a new "intelligent" weapon, only known under the name of code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict over there with the Talibans and "will change the play" with their profit.
The new weapon is like a precise super gun
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of gauge 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing an explosive highly breaking, function in fact like small grenades.
One can program the ammunition in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
One can thus use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected either from in top and when fall to him a fatal rain above from steel glares, that can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took share with the development of the XM-25, new rifle is the first weapon of infantry which uses "intelligent" technology.
" The soldier makes use of it primarily in such a way that it finds the target, sends a laser beam to him which determines the distance, thus obtains a point of precise aiming, according to which it corrects his aiming site and supports on the relaxation.
"Let us say that you aimed at 543 meters."
" When you press the relaxation, the weapon takes care and draws with the distance of 543 meters more or less 1,2,3 meters, indicated Audette.
400 delocalized employment
The Fujitsu group delocalizes its subsidiary company of Bad Homburg towards Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 collaborators will transfer to Astro Park their work place which is currently at the office building of the Mareinbader Place in the area of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu delocalizes its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As affirmed it Wednesday the giant specialized in manufacture and the maintenance of the computers, the next year in July, the work place of 400 men and women, located until now on the Marienbader place of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, immense complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße of the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should gather there 100 other employment still scattered up to now in the area.
The offer of hiring was extremely gravitational. In addition, the offices with open surface of Astro Park are appropriate better for the work method of the collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was right tenant.
The managing director, Bernd Wagner, declared: "Frankfurt-Niederrad constitutes for us a paramount site having a remarkable infrastructure."
He affirms that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a total company like Fujitsu.
The new removal of an important company inside the area caused the joy of gaining yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The person in charge of the economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), declared that once again, a "planetary actor" had been thus conquered.
It is a "extraordinary relative profession of faith instead of establishment."
Fujitsu is appropriate for the city and its establishment constitutes an important dash for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we proposed our assistance to this company," Mr. Korwisi declared.
However, the friendly relations could not anything have changed with the difficulties of the computer maker vis-a-vis the owner of the building of the Marienbader Place.
In the final analysis, the economic reasons would have been determining.
It is a question from now on of preventing that a so exceptional place does not remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and financial backer of the building will be co-operative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place of the Town hall, used up to now by the company Fujitsu and "small the close vertical," as well as the remainder of the buildings of the Marienbad Place, belonged to the discussed construction project of the thermal spa.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entry of the city was created between the station and the Town hall. This one caused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive installation of surfaces which were used formerly partly as carpark, but also because the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company of notation and councils in investment, Feri, the computer maker for the delivery systems of the voyages, Start Amadeus, like Fujitsu, computer maker at the time still associated with Siemens, moved in the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen repurchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the funds Morgan Stanley real estate. One year later, these buildings were resold at the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group whose seat is in Tokyo regards as the third larger supplier of data-processing products in the world.
For example, it places computers and waiters at the disposal of the companies and also ensures the essential service.
Its branch established in the area of the Rhine-Hand is one of most important in Germany: Fujitsu counts undoubtedly much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leave Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiary companies present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a named company TDS.
For that, 7000 square meters took in hiring in the building Astro Park.
This old twenty years complex, whose name points out its outline drawing of star, shelters inter alia the seat of the Confederation of the electronics industry and electrotechnical.
Expulsion of the waiter by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks has difficulties more and more.
Service provider Internet Amazon expelled of his waiters the specialized site in the revelation of confidential documents.
Perhaps this attitude hiding place political pressures undergone after the publications of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, remains apparently in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with always more force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" does not have any more access to its waiter lodged up to now in America and seeks from now on a shelterer in Europe.
During this time, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is sought by Interpol, probably remains in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon waiter."
"Freedom of expression with the country of freedom," indicated to Wednesday (standard time) the cyber-activists at the origin of the revelations via the Twitter social network.
Little before, the cyber-company, Amazon, had removed the documents of Wikileaks of its waiters.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists had recourse to the Service Web of Amazon (AWS) in order to be able to reach the greatest number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars from now on are spent to deal with people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem with Amazon, "they should cease selling books."
The CNN television channel, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its waiters after the survey carried out by the collaborators of the senator Joe Lieberman.
The president of the commission of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott in his opposition, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have wished that Amazon takes this measurement earlier have regard to the preceding publications by Wikileaks of classified as information" affirmed the senator.
In parallel, Mr. Liebermann invited the other countries to refuse the use of the waiters by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous way and without scruples. By doing this, it puts our national security in danger and danger the life everywhere throughout the world," according to an independent official statement of the senators.
"No company conscious of its responsibilities, that it is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to diffuse the contents of the stolen documents."
Founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, which is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is reproduced on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to the information disseminated by the London newspaper "Independent The," the Australian one 39 years lives in the United Kingdom and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is it.
The cyber-activist constantly qualified intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the legal actions in his opposition by Sweden.
The spokesperson of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, declared in London that threats were uttered against the site.
"Of the calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
This is why Assange fears particularly for its safety, declared Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, required that the persons in charge of the revelations made by Wikileaks be continued and is carried out for treason.
In Canada, the adviser of the Head of government Mr. stephen Harper declared on television, obviously in an ironic way, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
During this time, a polemic started between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson of the US president, Mr. Barack Obama, qualified the "ridiculous one and absurdity" the fact that Mr. assange required the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if this one were responsible for the order given to the diplomats, and revealed very recently, to devote himself to activities of espionage.
"I do not know exactly why we must deal with the opinion of individual owner of Web site," Mr. Gibbs declares.
"Our foreign politics and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a Web site."
The US government completely passes from now on to the testing ground the protection of its databases.
According to an official statement of the White House, Mr. Russell Through, assistant editor of the Center of the fight anti-terrorist, were named responsible to fight against the escapes.
Mr. Through is charged to set up "the structural reforms necessary" made essential after the disclosures of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which all the administration exchanges and protects the information.
Moreover, the US government announced that he wanted to deal with the safety of the dissidents and the militants if ever those were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We very implemented to come into contact with them" indicated the spokesperson of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that proves to be necessary."
The university of the Ice
At the "Gelato university" of Bologna, one prepares the confectioners of ice at the best seasons of the year.
The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a very great success and attracted visitors come from everyone whole.
To does the fact, from which come all the ice?
Glacier and machine with ice.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat obsolete confectioner of ice, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of manufacture of the ice.
The turbine with ice removes the cream of ice of the window cooled using a spatula, lays out it in waffle and then starts to sell it.
For the knowledge, one does not need to go in Anzola dell' Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wishes to know some more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice-cream freezers founded the university of ice in 2003 so that the creams of ice left its machines answer the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a very great success and attracted visitors come from everywhere in the world.
Are also offered special courses relating to the chocolate ice and extending over several days. In the same way, of the practical meetings are organized in the private mirror factory.
In full midlife crisis, a certain number of people dream of a new career, others simply go so far as to carry out their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, they are 40 participants come from 19 country of all the continents, of Brazil in Saudi Arabia while passing by Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education come from California is set on the movement Slow Food. He wants in the future to offer a European product of quality to the country of the industrial Ice.
Anke of Berlin east adviser in management of company and it wants, after a few years, to draw some thing from singular of this trade testing for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream to open a mirror factory in Cairo.
A man originating in Malta and another come from Brazil would like to improve quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because his/her children adore the Italian ice creams.
The Master glacier Luciano Ferrari initially explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ices.
Is determining not only good savour, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still preserves one crowned amount of romanticism."
The first stage in manufacture appears completely simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer which heats all with 85 degrees grace an electronic program, then cools immediately with four degrees.
It opens then a tap installed on the machine: it leaves a pasteurized basic white cream there, base of all the kinds of ices to milk.
The trainer is assailed at once by question: Is it possible to manufacture ice by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of the experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact of letting itself induce in error by the spirit of time.
That which speaks only about the ices "manufactured starting from the natural ingredients," perhaps in spite of that used of the stabilizers: generally a natural product, for example of the seed flour of guar obtained starting from bean of guar.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using of stabilizer, only it should be sold within 24 hour, if not it crumbles and the customer will anything else crunch only granules of ice.
Certain modifications of the basic mass are allowed.
That becomes more enthralling with the flavours.
The Luciano Master establishes the difference between the ingredients which one acquires in the ray fruits or confectioneries of the supermarket.
Moreover, there exists powder and pastes.
"the suppliers will try all to you refiler dozen aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should quite simply test."
Maybe in the receipts of sorbets to the fruits with fresh sugar and fruits.
Maybe in the ice creams manufactured starting from the basic mass white which, while adding of eggs becomes a yellow cream and constitutes to it, when one adds cocoa powder to it, the base of all the possible desserts to the chocolate.
Now, all the participants in the course must pass to the use of the machines to ice.
Luciano from time to time invites them to manufacture four kinds of ices: with vanilla, with the chocolate, the mocha coffee and hazel nut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less of flavour of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The various kinds of ices to the fruits are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit mashed potatoes: from the point of view of the taste, that is not absolutely better.
The ice with hazel nuts inevitably does not comprise the taste of nut, when it is composed mainly of hazel nuts.
The ice with kiwi, very popular, is manufactured starting from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice," affirms Luciano.
The manufacture of the ice is a exercise of calculation: if one uses mashed potatoes of fishing with much of sugar, it is necessary that the quantity of sugar is reduced in the basic receipt.
A sugar supplement is necessary for the ice to lemon.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the various types of fruits (the vine growers make use of it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of the ice does not require any more, like formerly, as much of physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine tool of the basic mass which helps.
There exists also an apparatus in which one beats simultaneously the mixture of ice available to return it consistent and brought back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, light breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo smears fruit mashed potatoes of the head to the feet and, thus, splashes his/her fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes to him.
The Luciano Master thinks that a "similar incident is likely to occur at the time of each course: it is only one matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to certain sources, the industry which tests the culture of the genetically modified plants cored the European Authority of safety of food.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech group of expert which is regarded as an institute independent for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"That sounds like a theory of the conspiracy, but us informed well," declared Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Directeur of Testbiotech.
Certain information gives a report on what the president of the Efsa group of expert for the genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as of other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby.
This last is financed by the groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated in a way determining in the development of the regulations of test of Efsa for the genetically modified plants and is, so clearly in a conflict situation of interests, according to criticisms formulated by Mr. Then.
The elaborate regulations correspond textually, by subparagraphs, to the standpoint of the Ilsi lobby and thus carry the mark of the industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A person in charge of high ranking of Efsa recently joined without condition or transitional period the agroalimentary group Swiss Syngenta. By doing this, It changed camp
Little time ago, even the Radio of Germany Centrale (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union in charge of control and the industrial lobby, which woke up the suspicions as well German Federal agency for the environment as of the European deputies.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that one exploits all the reliable data, including those of industry as long as they are of a professional good quality.
One does not prohibit to the experts working on behalf of Efsa to tie contacts with this branch of industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the international institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization regards itself as a neutral forum gathering the experts who belong, inter alia, with the field of sciences, industry and the policy in order to evaluate the risks of biotechnology without being with the pay of a lobby.
In this business, independent experts such that Mr. Then disapprove the fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without any test of food in the animals and that one did not test the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We wish to know which are, for example, the incidences of genetically modified corn causes with the field" affirms Mr. Then.
The current practice consists in testing only isolated proteins and not all the seedling genetically modified, which does not make it possible to obtain reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how can one then discover them?" wonder Mr. Then about an accusing tone.
It is also the point of view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist carries out research since 1994 in the field of the genetics and currently works at the polytechnic school of Zurich.
In this area as in the United States, and from now on also in Europe, the sector of industry tries more and more to influence or discredit the critical scientists.
This is why, there exist hardly still researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of company, the critical studies would not be published.
Mrs. Hilbeck affirms that "industry controls research on safety."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell got some, on the whole approximately 400 kilo.
Monday afternoon, it was in front of the station of Stuttgart with its tube with the back.
There was manif.
It snowed.
The history is known: In September, the general purpose excavators had come and started to demolish most of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was not any more the same one: Several thousands of people expressed against the project S21, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station which will cost several billion.
Most of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration led to the stoppage of the works of construction.
Broken in 6000,7000 pieces.
Muschelkalk (shelly limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender paving stone and coarse evil builds between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43 year old sculptor residing at Ostfildern.
It got some fragments of them.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a rock modest and cheap, simple and terrestrial."
It affirming that by cutting out it with the saw, he felt the odor of the cigarette smoke.
It does not know yet what it will do of this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old ammunition dump of the French Army in a forest located close to Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built its stone empire.
This 44 year old man makes the trade of old stones.
It bought all the stones resulting from the demolition to Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge" declares it in its office located in a hut, which was formerly a guardroom.
He tells that he was the subject of insults and of threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had the remainder of the northern wing to the demolition contractor buys.
But it negotiated during whole days with the adversaries of the S21 project.
And he explained to them why he could nothing make whole to be opposed to the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 adversaries of the S21 project carried one of the stone parallelepiped thereafter weighing on average 80 kilos whose value lies between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keeps it like remembering in while also hoping to be able to return it during a rebuilding.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 loadings complete of a truck.
Approximately half is still piled up in the forest, the remainder being for a long time sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardener, Private individuals.
They came from everywhere and carried all that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart were transformed for a long time into "Mäuerle" or limitations of the grass plat bands.
"With the fact, this stone is nothing in particular" says Mr. Rongen.
"have-be this political component."
It enters its cross-country car, makes the turn of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
It made studies of right which it gave up. Later, he undertook to study biology before being interested thereafter in data processing and becoming finally a carrier.
And a stone amateur.
It stores 40000 tons.
It piles up treasures in Germany everywhere.
HE affirms that he is the largest merchant of the old stones.
It refrene.
Sand stones carved with art are posed on snow.
"Formerly, They belonged to the bridge of Marienbrücke to Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, heat, affirm it with enthusiasm.
"My preferred stone."
It takes the way which goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of the finger: Red sand Pierre, before, left the station of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertine."
The parallelepiped formed formerly part of the platform of Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and the stories, the travertine of Cannstatt coming from the police headquarter, the reddish granite coming from the cathedral Blasien saint, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, What a efforts, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that formerly the stones were carved with the hand and were moved using simple hoists and of the carts drawn by oxen, it becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such an inheritance were put in part."
It did not become rich, even less richissime.
But this carrier employs 14 people today. Moreover, of the stone masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass-blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifiant," affirms the recyclor of waste.
Soon, it must go to Cologne.
Over there also, there are stones to save.
Fight of talents to conquer the high potentials
The counter knows a sharp multitude.
16 students hustle themselves to buy bread rolls with salmon, tomato sauce and white-mangers.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited the students in design and mechanical engineering with a workshop.
Within the framework of a kind of contest of ideas, they must speak trade about the car about the future with the originators of VW, and, while passing, to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to unearth better brains and to begin, like Volkswagen, in a multiform co-operation with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatres before the latter do not arrive on the labour market and that they are not courted by the others.
And since the universities do not publish declarations concerning the performances of their students, one tries to locate the exceptional talents within the framework of the practical projects and the fidéliser.
At the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automobile group persuades the talents.
A young lady of the service of personnel divides the pens, of candies and the charts comprising the logo of Volkswagen.
She speaks about the calendar of the professional training courses and the student jobs to the young talents; she shows the ways to them to reach the enclosure of the group.
It is Nico Selle of the technical university of Braunschweig which is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there exist reciprocal advantages for the two parts: "The students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain in experiment."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, look at the serious candidates more closely and appreciate those which enter in account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, Such a co-operation is unusual.
What there is again, it is the offensive with which one seeks to attract oneself the students.
"Formerly, the stress was laid rather on the community project," affirms Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of the new graduates will become much rougher.
In goods of the sectors, the companies cannot recruit their collaborators any more by carrying out a sorting on a string of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and especially court the highly qualified labour.
They are especially the graduates from the dies of engineering which are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40.000 posts of engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum relating to the posts of engineer will still increase.
Roman Dykta goes to hunting to the talents for the account of KPMG, cabinet of audit, accountancy and council.
It organizes expensive events aiming to the recruitment of the talents, such as for example the race cruising KPMG-Race, a species of rally-paper where the competitors must find their way using coordinates GPS.
The company thus will send eight promising students the next year so that they traverse this way the United States.
The participants can incidentally visit the subsidiary companies of KPMG and know the company.
That which must take part in it decides in advance after two procedures of selection.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search of the high potentials in the universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch thanks to the race cruising."
"For us, a simple cruising was not enough thing"
For the hunter of talents which is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we remained in liaison with all the people having taken share last year with a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and wish to address soon their requests to our company." affirm it.
Apart from the direct softening carried out in the campus, the small and medium-size companies proceed in a completely traditional way while taking part in the professional fairs where they are delivered to hunting for the brains.
"We try to reach the graduates while taking part in the professional living rooms."
"For example, to the living room of solar technologies," indicates Mrs. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company installed in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe is informed of the problems related to the changing.
Currently, 35 stations are put at the competition based on the site of the company.
"In this moment, it is very difficult to provide with the vacant posts."
"Does That is expensive and takes much time," ensure?
Another means of establishing the contact consists in passing through the professors of university.
Solarworld established a co-operation with various establishments of higher education, for example, the university of Freiburg.
"The professors indicate that the student with the possibility of carrying out professional training courses or of on our premises writing its project of end of study."
Expensive publicity campaigns are announced in the specialists in the solar one.
Therefore the company tries to make its publicity by putting forward other qualities: personalized environment, hierarchy punt and easy communication.
"Often, a great group cannot do that," supports Mrs. Stübe, personnel manager.
A long time ago that the money does not hold any more the main role in the looking for a job.
The flexible work hours, the guard of children or good possibilities of promotion constitute the other determining factors.
According to a study undertaken by the institute Great Places to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55e place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute constitutes an annual honnor roll of the German employers.
For this purpose, he questions the collaborators on their satisfaction degree compared to their work and to his context while looking at the condition-frameworks of the employees.
The personnel manager Mrs. Stübe hopes that this placement will make it possible to raise the image of the company near the applicants for work.
"I think that the candidates rely especially on the external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher To employ Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises the companies which wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises with his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means above all to take internal measures.
"The best means for an employer of making itself gravitational is to pass through his/her clean collaborators," affirms it.
That is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal strategy of image, i.e. the creation of the brand image of the employer within his own manpower.
"the satisfied collaborators train the best messengers."
When his employees well are treated and that they are identified with the company, they make only the publicity of their employer near their friends and knowledge.
"It is as if one played in an orchestra," Mr. Kriegler declares.
Obama applies a brake at new oil drillings
There will not exist new oil drillings in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, State of the south-east of the United States, during the years to come.
The government of Washington pronounced a prohibition an equivalent prohibition and, thus, definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, of new drillings remain for the moment prohibited.
The secretary inside Ken Salazar made this advertisement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" which is at the origin of this strict prohibition. This one must remain into force at least for the five next years.
Vis-a-vis this accident which with cost the life eleven employees and conduit with the greatest environmental catastrophe of the United States, President Barack Obama, subjected to the pressure of the opposition and this branch of industry, had indicated that it was laid out to authorize the realization of new drillings in the oriental party of the Gulf of Mexico.
The partisans of this solution want to thus reduce the dependency of the United States with respect to the foreign countries as regards the supply oil.
The question of knowing which takes the responsibility for the oil slick devastator in the golf, so far, is not definitively solved.
The British oil group, which is confronted with compensation requests of several billion, is in the center of the charges.
A board of inquiry created by Obama must report its in December.
In October, the secretary inside Ken Salazar had raised the freezing of the drilling issued after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had at once presented requests relative to new projects of drilling.
With more strict control measures and more severe security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The qualified controlling authority, which was discredited after many accusations of corruption, is the subject currently of reform in-depth.
In parallel, Mr. Obama announced would remove them the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
The actors of this branch of industry publicly warn from now on against the fact that the rate of feed in the gulf would be definitely lower than it is not the case until now.
"The objective of the government is to put a brake at the rapid growth of the sector of gas and oil" according to the result of a survey current carried out in the sector by the cabinet of audit BDO, before the marked prohibition of drilling Wednesday.
Moreover, American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty which characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
The investments agreed in new projects of support were deferred until new order, with the detriment of the growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water which runs in the rivers is oiled brown; it releases an odor similar to that which exists in the gasoline station: Because of an escape, billion liters of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
The men live of flight, corruption and the refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has an good intention.
"You do not exhaust," lance the militant ecologist with the journalists to calm them: "You today still enough of oil mud in front of the duckweed."
The 37 year old Nigerian tried to photograph a young person inserted in muddy water to the chest, as well as the fatty trail which surrounds it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water glare to the color of the rainbow.
One cannot realize that the basement abounds in brown crude oil tablecloths.
On bank of the Bodo-Jetty river, Esther Badom tells that, formerly, it collected shrimps by whole buckets here.
But meanwhile calm water completely dried up.
Five years ago, an enormous quantity of oil spouted out of a pipeline having exploded in the immense marsh.
The fishermen living the small town close to Bodo must from now on row during six hours to reach full of fish water: The Ogoni country located in the middle of the Delta of Niger is regarded as one of the areas most polluted in the world.
All the extent of the devastations jumps to the eyes when one traverses the marshes of mangrove crossed by rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat splits a water chestnut cradingue. Whoever plunges its hand there withdraws it very covered with oil.
Roots of small of the mangrove emergent of the ground like sticks of liquorice. The isolated palm trees sadly let hang their palms.
The clouds of birds in vain are sought, as one usually meets some in the wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence falls down on this paradise of formerly which resembles a service station by the odor that it releases.
"What occurs here, it is war against the environment" declares Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger with regard to health."
The comparison of the wars is made.
The area where live Ogoni is a battle field besieged since of tens of years: There is more than 60 years, the first explorers European penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the years 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this one was carried out later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this area because those had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today still, the return to the Ogoni country is interdict at this company: Whereas more than 2 million barrel of black gold are daily pumped thanks to more than 5000 wells of drilling and 7000 kilometers of pipelines in the whole of the area of the Delta, three times large like Switzerland, the oil-bearing fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable there for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters are drawn up in the water of the steel trestles like odd sculptures: One very affectionately indicates "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, the majority are corroded by corrosion until the reference mark.
Akpobari estimates that a head of drilling of this nature breaks of piece from time to time, because a constant crude oil flood runs in water.
According to the estimates of the experts, more than two billion liters flowed on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the quantity of oil equivalent to that which ran out in the sea at the time of the accident of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" there is 21 years off Alaska, one of largest the catastrophe environmental in the history of humanity.
Who has to take the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actor.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and the siphoning of the pipelines are responsible of more than 90 pourcent of pollution. The environmentalists for their part regard the explosions of the heads of drilling and the pipelines perforated as the leading causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner reproached the Shell group for applying to Nigeria of the security standards primarily less strict than everywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of the conduits is "still much higher than alleures."
Certain forms emergent of the mangroves at a place which, considering by far, resembles a workshop given up, full of dirty oil and installed with the free air: They are completely naked and dirty oil covers to the neck.
A fire scintillates under one of the many barrels which sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be reference mark: a small clandestine refinery.
One makes heat crude oil in the barrel during several hours, explains Michael, the foreman.
Initially, the gasoline penetrates in a container while passing by pipes, then, at the end of the control of the kerosene drops fall and one obtains finally diesel.
Thus Michael and his/her four collaborators daily produce four barrels of Diesel of 300 liters: "That brings back 34.000 to us Naira," approximately 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than that ridiculously low of hardly 40 centimes of Euro per liter of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material free.
this one is offered by the "guards" who put the network of the pipelines in borer everywhere through the country of Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this manner at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the whole of the Delta of Niger.
Only a completely unimportant small portion of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: The networks of the organized crime which also count among its members of the politicians and soldiers of high ranking, charge the lions share in tankers and sell off it on the worldwide market.
The Akpobari militant considers that the bearing debate on the question of knowing if it is necessary to allot the environmental catastrophe or rather the subversive activities with the population or the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived like intruders and if the bases of the life of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor flight and illegal refineries."
But, Entre-temps, the relations of Ogoni especially with respect to Shell worsened so much that it was not any more question but withdrawal of the group. "perhaps that the operators having other nationalities, like the Chinese, will appear better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you give up" advertisement the robust workman of oil.
"The soldiers can appear constantly."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but at most they will offer bribes to them.
Even the soldiers especially originating in the north of the country intend to benefit like all the Nigerians from the raw material.
"From any point of view, this rotten trick made fall our quite low country," regrets Akpori.
The investigators discover constructional defects in the engines of A380
A380 suffers obviously from a large security issue.
By examining an apparatus which carried out an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible constructional defect which can lead to "catastrophic failure of the engine."
The Qantas airline company wants to now carry felt sorry for against the manufacturer of the engine.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus pertaining to the Quantas company had obviously had up to now more chance: During the survey which it carried out, the Australian authority in charge of the air security noted that the engines of certain A380 apparatuses presented a serious security issue, and it warns against a possible constructional defect.
This potential failure could involve serious consequences: It can cause splits of tiredness and escapes on the level of the connection of the conduit of oil, indicates one in a standpoint published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the engines."
Are concerned the engines manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft with a380 series.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to land on November 4 in Singapore urgently, appears among those.
The Australian airline company from now on engaged of the legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of engines.
It lodged a legal complaint with an Australian federal court whose seat is in Sydney. This step gives him the possibility of taking other legal measures against the company.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, declared that its company would claim relative damages with the incident which has occurred at the beginning of November.
Parts were detached and the airfoil was damaged during the fire of the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the oil ignition which is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 engines must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that other tests relating to safety will be carried out on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the engines in questions.
The recommendations of safety are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, indicated the spokesperson of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security issue is regarded as sufficiently important informing all the parts concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the Quantas airline company had immobilized on the ground all its fleet of A380 during one week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three from its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced, by measure of precaution, the engine of A380.
The plane on two floors is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall on all the territory causes a chaos in transport
Very covered Germany of white: In one night, snow fell on almost all the country.
Chaos reigns on all the roads, the trains and the planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter made grelotter Germany: By freezing temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In north and the east, the cover of snow reaches 15 centimetres by places.
Circulation is strongly restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On a7 main road in Flensburg, the personnel of the winter service worked in a permanent way, but they could not come to end from the snow which did not cease accumulating.
Moreover, of violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic.
The Federal office in charge with sea transport and hydrography (DSH) expects it of the tidal waves take place known the Baltic coast of the Schleswig-Holstein with water level which can reach 1,2 m above the normal.
The snowdrifts on the motorways and the federal roads involved serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the power station of alarm of Meteomedia bad weather announced the purple level of alarm was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, it fell 30 centimeters of snow there fresh that the strong winds and expenses dispersed.
Several trucks and cars remained wedged the night there.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, the authorities of police force announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On a2 motorway, snow and the wind involved an interruption of circulation and caused stoppers.
In Thuringe, the snowfalls touched the motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances of the rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and in the north of Bavaria.
The main issues are: snow on the railroads, the trees fallen on the railways, the destroyed overhead lines or needles.
In Saxony, one had to stop interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, in Thuringe, a train ICE bound for Munich had to stop its voyage.
The firemen and the ancillary medical ones had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in covers, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
The Snowfalls involved many cancellations of flight in the principal airports of Germany.
According to a spokesperson of the standard and information on the flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson of Fraport indicates that 40 flights were already cancelled in Frankfurt on the Hand.
The winter service ensures a permanent service it.
It is true that the passengers wedged with the airport are not numerous any more, in spite of that hardly 400 beds are placed there at their disposal.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening with Ostholstein, a driver of truck lost the life at the time of a collision with a train with a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly wounded.
Because of the layers of snow present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was grabbed with a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost the life.
Four passengers were wounded in the train, this is why the road going of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours.
Moreover, a 30 year old woman died when its car flipped over on a slippery pavement with Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: Snow will be certainly always soft and powdery, but it will whirl in the event of light gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic will be afflicted by strong winds and rapids.
The weather is however very cold, until less 15 degrees by places.
Deutsche Bank seeks a purchaser for his twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks purchasers for its two office buildings located at its head office of Frankfurt.
This building could pay up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the seat of the group: The twin towers located in the District of businesses were modernized; while waiting, the bankers had to turn over in their old place of employment.
Henceforth, the financial group obviously seeks to recover the costs of restorations and he seeks a purchaser for his two buildings, like writes it the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland," quoting a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons of the sale envisaged.
He declared "we check if it is more interesting to occupy ourself the buildings or to sell them, and to put them again in hiring later on."
Thus the greatest financial institution of Germany already yielded its seat, little time afterwards.
It is only in the middle of year 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million Euro near the holders of equities. She had then rehabilitated them.
The energy transformations aiming to optimization absorbed, according to certain indications, approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would bring back obviously much money to the bank.
According to furnished informations by the newspaper, the experts of this branch of industry estimate the value of the turns, renamed meanwhile "green Towers," to approximately 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, one currently does not know if the buildings will be again sold with funds belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry the minors who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried minors who were declared died following several explosions which have occurred in a mine.
One had not been able yet to go up the bodies because the safe situation of the well disaster victim continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine close to the town of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age ranges between 17 and 62 years had been buried under ground.
A probe had been introduced into the well disaster victim, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Because of the strong concentration of pollutant gases and other explosions which followed, no rescue squad could go down in the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors were not likely any more any to survive.
Up to now the bodies could not by being gone up.
Today, parents and friends organized a festival with the memory of deaths.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun bursting with Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried minors, one installed 29 tables on which one could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photographs and personal effects, among which clothing and the boards of surfing, also had their place there.
The flags were put in Bern in front of all the public edifices of the country.
New Zealand the Prime Minister John Key declared with the participants in the commemorative festival which New Zealand nourished the hope that the minors would go up on the surface.
"But they never returned to the house."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose Zen son was buried in the pits declared that it cannot be resigned to accept the death of his son as long as it will not have seen his remainders.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took share with the commemorative festival.
Minors of South-African and British origin also buried during the first explosion of November 19.
The first-aid workers started to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the island of the South of the Zealand News.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to the journalists that when the oxyhydrogen gas masses are moved, the extreme temperatures inside the mine start to drop.
Goes in hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
The realizer Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising," epopee of the combatant.
With which public the Danish realizer Nicolas Winding Refn it could well think while turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) not having that an eye is made prisoner; he releases himself from his torturer and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries the ones after the others. That seems ideal for the young male spectators with research of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When it is of bad mood, it tears off the intestines of its enemies without waiting until those died.
On another side, until the end of film, the one-eyed one does not say any word on its true name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, with the turning of one or two sentences some cries of anguish terrible.
If not, one says nothing and one feasts in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which constitutes the decoration of the universe of the Vikings, approximately thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more the mature scenario writers having an interest for the existentialism and the excellent dollies.
When a film aims several group-targets, it is damage that those are excluded mutually.
The realizer Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher tractor," his trilogy relating to the drug trafficker savage and full with style, like a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the current dominating or to introduce a little less brutality with the cinema of art and test.
The majority of the sympathizers of the cinema of art must test horror vis-a-vis the brain which is spread around and with the intestines.
The action film amateurs die of trouble, when the one-eyed one embarks, for reasons which one can freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent one in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm one and the fog before the crew does not arrive to America and continues to keep silent itself.
It is not then astonishing that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that there does not exist that under format DVD.
It is especially because of the splendid images of the misery which deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, time with other, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a question of dialogues in this film, nor of a coherent action, all is environment, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The spectator cannot escape from it.
Refn grants hardly a moment to him of relaxation and crosses to him slowly the throat with icy images and a lugubrious soundtrack, but especially with an imperceptible hatred which spouts out heart of the characters.
Only a young fair boy, who is held accurately at the sides of the one-eyed one, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than all, the one-eyed hero whose mobiles are never known, but which returns from the hell constantly to fight enemies and temporarily allies while being transformed into warrior, is perhaps as an envoy of the devil itself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, only for those which are, in any way, rotted.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film which one can hate or admire, who has as a finality the irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
An experiment traumatisante.
Mysterious excavation work
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to discuss this subject, even less to subject itself to controls of the agency.
In the night of September 5, 2007 about midnight, at least four fighter plans F-15 I Israelis attacked a mysterious building of cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is located on bank of the euphrate; more the big city located in the vicinity is with 30 kilometers: it is Dair ensure.
Its name appears in the documents of the IAEA, because it is question of the engine which Syria built appears it with the assistance of the North Korea in stone parallelepiped, dissimulated in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, going back to at the end of April 2008, the current, known engine under the name of the close locality, el-Kibar, would be quite ready to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture the atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique is valid since the years 1950.
The CIA showed a comprising video of presentation of the fuzzy satellite images.
Through the animation computer-assisted, it indicated the probable site of each component of the engine before the destruction of the power station which represents a copy in miniature of the model North-Korean of the nuclear plant of Yongbyon.
Moreover, it presented the photographs showing the building located in the vicinity, even the interior of this one.
It seems that the engine was about to be brought into service, but he was not equipped yet with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, one has hardly more information than at the time, and even, with time the mystery thickens more and more.
The former president of the George W. Bush United States recently revealed in his memories that before this attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had built an engine with el-Kibar, but did not have peu' indices showing this country developed "an active program of nuclear armament."
Certain intelligence agents in Europe prefer being more careful on this subject and speak only about one "supposed engine," even if they regard the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They miss tangible proofs, like with the IAEA.
Questioned on the way in which it makes sure that it deals with nuclear reactor, diplomat of high ranking of the Nations Plain gave only one laconic answer in summer by affirming that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to put questions."
The Syrians removed certainly with precipitation the debris of the "military building unutilised" and carried out a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of the experts of the IAEA led by the former inspector as a chief Oli Heinonen, discovered with el-Kibar uranium traces produces by the men.
Moreover, the IAEA received thanks to a Member State of the images of satellites of the commercial people receiving benefits showing the moment which followed the attack directly. it seems that these last are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs are not available on the market because the anonymous silent partner, perhaps Israel, acquired them of exclusiveness.
It is of this fact impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective way.
Syria always ensured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built an engine.
Damas supports that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA challenged this argument after the analysis of the particles by describing it as incredible.
Since this time, Damas refuses any discussion on this subject, just like about the images of satellite.
Moreover, Syria does not make it possible to the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refusal the access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently declared: "We will never make comments on this subject."
Thus the investigation relative to this business trails in length since June 2008 without one arriving to a result and that it "is transformed more and more into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as recognizes it a Western diplomat of high ranking in service to the head office of the IAEA in Vienna, finally he acts of a serious violation of the treaty of prohibition of the nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clear up the existence of the three other installations which must have "a functional relationship" with supposed the engine.
Until now, the inspectors neither indicated of which installations it acts here, nor which is their function or what one them suspect to contain.
According to the information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj have-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also of the name of the close cities.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (international institute of sciences and international safety) of Washington identified these localities and discovered on images of satellites a complex close to Masyaf which would be most probably one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly beside this one; it is exactly the reason for which Syria refuses the access of the three sites to the inspectors of the IAEA.
In Vienna, one affirms that the Syrians fear that the group of inspection is in fact of the spies who would be sent in the name of the United States by the IAEA in order to espionner the military installations.
To tell the truth, it is information provided by the American secret agents which drawn the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including the satellite photos, indicating that vehicles made shuttles between the three sites and the parallelepiped of stone in order to transport substances.
A Western diplomat of high ranking declared in Vienna that at least one of the installations could "be used for the production of fuel."
It would not have "not indications concerning of the significant activities," such as the enrichment and the reprocessing of uranium; processes which are essential to the production of the atomic weapons.
This type of engine functions certainly thanks to uranium not enriched.
Nevertheless, there exists with the rigour of the plausible assumptions concerning the following fundamental questions: from where the uranium should have come and where one would have separated later plutonium necessary to manufacture from the bomb.
One is unaware of if rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks charged with ground disappear, nobody will have information on the stock room of rubble.
For the IAEA, it, is not very probable that Syria made examine in 1998 the Al-Tibni salt mine, only located a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of Euphrate, to see whether it can be appropriate for the storage of the radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing photographs taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane' S Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a bond between those and the engine in question.
Photographs taken by satellite show however that Syria undertook excavation work in the three sites suspect and moved enormous containers when the IAEA started to require the access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but that did not contribute to draw aside the suspicions.
In he thinks in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months to work out a plan concerning the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to make it possible Syria to preserve possible military secrecies. Only time invested watch which great interest the inspectors carry to this business.
During this time, Damas also despized this proposal.
One year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not given a report on the destruction of the engine, the urgency would not be announced for this business, affirms, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who has evoked for a few months what is known under the name the special inspections, one of the most powerful means the atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, which had to propose these inspections, already spoke certainly about "one option to which I am in the future open," but he still hesitates.
This means involves an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority with the Council of the governors of the IAEA and a good number of the 35 countries which are represented there does not want any to see the situation knowing a climbing.
in addition, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "For that it would be used, so at the end they do not find anything"
Love in time of war
That is badly since Angelina Jolie made her beginnings in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario itself: it is a history of love between a woman originating in Bosnia and a Serb man of origin.
One knows nothing more about this history, but that is enough to cause it Malayan.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Moslem woman, fell in love with her Serb torturer during the war with Yugoslavia.
The federations of the Bosnian women immediately protested. In answer, certain sequences of turning envisaged in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is made to Hungary, but in the phase of post-production, the protests always continue in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of the women war victims addressed a correspondence to Angelina Jolie via Office of the High Commission of the United Nations for refugees (HCR) and it required to meet the actress. Pretty ambassador of good will of the HCR is itself.
It is not diplomat. A few weeks ago already, it proposed with these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but those declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," affirms Hasecic.
There no were stories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Pretty into known as rather long on its attitude towards the victims.
Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic has, thereafter, recommended to Office of the High Commission of the United Nations to withdraw the quality of ambassador of good will with Angelina Jolie.
But, with the fact, which kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian ministry of the culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted after some hesitations an authorization of turning in Sarajevo, but one does not know why did not then come in spite of this authorization.
The young author ensures itself that it does not pursue political goals with its film, that it is by doing many efforts that it was briefing of the Yugoslav conflict. It supports that it wants to put forward the terrible consequences of the war and to give the possibility to all the parts fascinating of being expressed.
It remains however vague about the contents.
Thus a second synopsis of film circulates on the Net. It is rather different: In love ones knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Moslem woman, is off-set in the concentration camp Serbe where the man works as guard.
What constitutes all the same a great difference with the version "a victim of rape amourache of its torturer."
That the film of Pretty started well before the war, of course.
The pressure which is exerted on it, thus is expressed Jolie, been "unjust and founded on erroneous information."
From now on, only the fanatics of Hollywood can get peace to him: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like good of others before.
Let us draw!
This evening, all goes again well to the Irishmen.
no the trace of consternation.
This is why the local team excessively dominates the visitors from Sweden, from Finland and the United States.
The fans howl of joy on bottom of a strong music, they trépignent feet.
Baileyu-pub of Cork in Ireland of the south vibrates parce the players launches and succeeds in making fall from the balls of table tennis at a distance of three meters in goblets to beer of the opposing team.
This odd spectacle is called "beer-pong." The winner empoche 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to attend in January Las Vegas the championship of the beer-pong world.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle play with drinking and the reserved data processing specialist, these two behaviors really does not go well together.
And yet, in spite of that, the 26 year old young man seeks to have fun, to be diverted terebrant question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing Las Vegas does not appear in its projects. In January, it will direct talks of recruiting in Zealand News.
"I test a strange feeling however" affirms it.
"The native land is so far and I do not have there employment."
Finally: His/her girlfriend already awaits it Auckland, "in less than two, it took down her job desired like in charge of event-driven project, perhaps a good sign" says the young man while smiling.
Because of the dark prospects to the country, two of the three sisters To tan tried their chance abroad.
His/her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides at Sydney, her Colin brother now occupies a post of consultant in data processing in London.
The young people from go away: The situation of the majority of the families which live on the island resemble that of tanning.
The experts of the Research institute economic and social indicate that 100,000 Irishmen will leave soon their country.
They envisage even a number of 200,000 emigrants from here at 2015.
What represents an enormous loss for a small country of 4,5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are carried out, it will be current of emigration comparable with that from which Ireland suffered in the years 1980.
After one decade of economic boom during which the Irishmen have enjoys a great ease, sorrow takes from now on all the place.
The economic crisis touches however especially the young Irishmen, well trained, who knew until now only moments of happiness.
The job loss and the social forfeiture appeared absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had an employment, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three people out of ten less than thirty years are with unemployment.
The newspaper Irish Times abundantly publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, all goes to the drift."
"There should be a rising against the politicians and the bankers, but that which has the possibilities of them, from goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last to leave extinct the light."
The coed in right Leanne Caulfield, president of the trade union of the Irish students, sees pointing a darker future because the government does nothing but throw powder with the eyes and no future prospect offers to young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have any strategy to create new jobs," declares young the 20 year old coed.
She sees how his/her comrades studs themselves of a training course practises not paid with another.
She declares that are its larger concern is to emigrate itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon to try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the living room "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers a support integral on the topic "to work abroad."
"But work abroad constitutes for the new ones in the profession an extraordinary occasion to take the first steps in the levels of the professional hierarchy," affirms the person in charge.
Its Web site shows the photographs of the surfers in Australia and the surfers of snows in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not a galère, but that also guarantees freedom and the pleasure.
Since six months, Seán O' Donovan, what means being based knows elsewhere.
As there was nothing any more to make in Ireland for this 29 year old engineer, it works from now on with 15 Irish colleagues in the sector of construction E Germany.
A house of mode precisely leaves ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other projects Hanover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O' Donovan visits only seldom its land native, because it takes part in an additional work station, in order to be able to complete to refund the credit contracted to build its house with the native land.
"The situation is already a little nutcase," affirms he by crossing the threshold of its house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I do not live practically any more."
It bursts of a laughter embarrassed while crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential zone with quite neat gardens of front, expensive cars of famous brands are stationed on the access roads.
Four years ago, O' Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed with 100 pourcent by the credit.
"They was moments of madness, without any doubt, the money was easy," affirms it.
Is it afraid to very see collapsing because of the credit?
O' Donovan reflects one moment, is used again of the hot and declares: "I do not have children to maintain and I am young; even all goes from through, I can set out again to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations that he hears often lately.
"Nobody must suffer from the hunger, our situation is nevertheless not as dramatic as what one lived formerly here in the island," supports it.
" To work during one moment abroad, it is not what can do without worse, perhaps it is what that we feel initially Irish.
He laughs and speaks then about his father who went to England at the time of the last great economic crisis.
"It was of return after having spent seven years there and, in Ireland, the life continued, quite simply."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
To leave the future and to discover how the life occurs elsewhere.
In its prize list, It counts already a few years of work in London. This is why the life should not be also easy in New Zealand for him and its girlfriend.
But there is still a thing which worries it well these last days: the festival to be organized at the time of its 27e birthday in Dublin.
It fears that it cannot be transformed into evening of good-bye.
"Only, not much of emotions," he says by drinking a long beer mouthful.
"A good-bye, that appears worrying all the same."
"Let us call rather that an evening of goodbye, very slackened, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some plays."
The democratic routine
The support for the democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just like that at the private company.
The crime became greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen like more influential than the United States in most of the area.
They are there certain conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published of exclusiveness by The Economist.
Since the survey was carried out systematically since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the area.
Two dependent elements arise from the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and at the beginning of October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of the Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of the attitudes towards the principal democracy and his institutions.
The support for the democracy increased appreciably in several countries on the circumference of the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example to Peru, where the economic growth reached on average 6% per annum since 2002, the support for the democracy passed from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was rectified after having undergone a strong fall of the production last year.
But only approximately half of the guarantors in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries area, are convinced democrats, which cause a drop in the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the guarantors of the area were declared satisfied in the way in which the democracy of their country functioned in practice; it acts of the same figure as last year but with a strong increase on the 25% in 2001 (graph 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same ones as last year in both cases; but in big rise compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support for the democracy.
If that held good during the world financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that the many ones of country of America underwent only one short recession and profited from a strong recovery.
Moreover, a network of social security contributed to protect the poor.
(The Economic commission of the United Nations for the Latin America brought back this week that the proportion of Latin-American living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again lowered this year, to 32%.)
But mood varies considerably from one country to another (cf graph 4).
The economic good performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, results in a largely shared feeling of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and in Central America where the recession was more severe and where the crimes violent one worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey started that more guarantors through the Latin America as a whole quoted the crime rather than unemployment as being the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Approximately 31% say that themselves or one of their close relation were victim of an criminal act during the past year; nevertheless, this figure is in fall compared to the 38% last year and is lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise of support for the private company and the market economy: approximately 71% of the guarantors of the area say that the private company is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (cf graph 6).
Some 58% estimate that the market economy is the only system which will return their country developed, against 47% last year.
Interesting fact, 62% of the guarantors in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their president of left, Hugo Chavez, exproprie of many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the area, mentioned by 19% of the questioned people (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, in fall of 11% since last year)
But the United States is regarded as the most influential country by the guarantors in Mexico and in most of the Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and in Nicaragua.
A soiled vote
Nobody expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was quite worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country disaster victim and plunged in fear.
One presented boxes of poll and a new poll, the ballot papers dispersed in the goutières, of the ransacked polling stations and the intimidations
The polling stations opened the evening late.
Much Hatïens, including the many ones which was moved following the seism of January, wandered in the vicinity to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen candidates to the presidential one, whose several supposed favourites, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded through the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mule, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, regards the event as "a rather good election with many regards."
Observers of the Organization of the American States and the Community of the Caribbean declared prudently that they "did not believe that these irregularities, so serious are, had necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted with Rene Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second awaited turn is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
Two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, were withdrawn from their initial call so that the vote is declared null.
But there can be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or not perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached to it second will toura reached the second turn.
With an cholera epidemic which makes rage, and more than 1 million survivors to the seism who still live in tents, one feared that the participation would be.
In fact, of many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing it because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250.000 indentity cards, necessary to vote, little time before the election was not distributed yet.
The stake is important.
The givers see the election of a popular and legitimate government like a big step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And thus, it is clear, the Haitians do it them-even.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after being become suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, profited from a wave of sympathy of the public which improved its rate of approval of 20 points, to more than 50%; it is about sound plus high level since she was elected in 2007.
However, to transform that into a campaign successful for a second mandate at the time of an election the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, obviously in mourning, according to which it would give up or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, on this subject, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeds to him as president, was accustomed to working out budgets which underestimated the revenues from taxes, the economic growth and inflation.
That made it possible the first couple to at will spend the additional incomes.
The government of Mrs. Fernández lost her majority with the Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank in the distress following the death of Mr. Kirchner of an heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissenting members of the movement peronist to the capacity joined with Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a member of Parliament struck with the face one of its pars and where others showed the government of corruption), the Congress does not have to approve the budget 2011.
"I will not dispute," declared the president.
Currently, the budget 2010 will be applied the next year, leaving to the president still a greater room for maneuver to spend at will.
The economy largely overheats: it is likely to grow of almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation accounts now for 11,1% but many private estimates and the salary demands of the trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, which took its functions in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made a priority of the growth and reduction of poverty, rather than of the control of inflation.
He refused to treat with the IMF, he badgered the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs. Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called with talks between the private companies and the trade union leaders.
And its civils servant say that they want to limit pay rises the next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports of Argentina.
But inflation eroded the nudge in the right direction with the growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps the reason for which Mrs. Fernández shows signs to want to restore the financial relations of Argentina towards the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the bond-holders who had refused a former reorganization forced of the debt for which Argentina had not regulated its expiries in 2001.
Now ms Fernández seems to Be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes nap $6.7 billion.
Kirchner always insisted on the fact that it could not imply a monitoring by the IMF, as it is of habit.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister for the Economy, announced that the Funds would provide a "technical assistance" to conceive a new national index of the prices the consumer; what resembles a prelude of the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in the policy beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is not any more at his sides.
If it does it, it has need to gain support of the middle-class, among which the kirchnerism is very preached.
When the Argentinian ones return their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy to it will have ebbed.
If she wants to gain another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, of many policies of her husband.
A half-hurrah for China
The Taiwanese voters are directed towards a kind of a narrower union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his/her big brother located on other side of the strait?
More than 7,5 million voters presented on November 27, that is to say 70% of the acceptable people, to elect the mayors and city council men in five urban districts, within the framework of what is regarded as a general evaluation of the president, My Ying-jeou.
Mr. My is itself become a substitute for the feelings compared to the continent, having tied innovative bonds of businesses, including a pact of free trade partial, in the greatest reorganization of the relations with China itself since 1949.
Successful Mr. the My test, but just.
Although its party Kuomintang (KMT) gained three of the five town halls, it failed to gain the majority of the votes.
Instead of that, the Party democrat-progressist (DPP), which leaned towards the complete independence of Taiwan, gained nearly 50% of all the votes for the KMT of 45%.
If that had been a presidential ballot, Mr. My would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of vote of its party fell from approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event revealed the majority of the principal subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including trucks with noisy countryside and flags of gathering of mass with girls who danced in minimal behaviour.
An obligatory mysterious attempted murder was also perpetrated.
Sean Bond, wire of Chan Bond, honorary president of the KMT, carried out an election tour for a candidate of the KMT the day before the election.
A man of crowd shot at young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding it and killing a passer by.
Oddly, it was not given if the gunner wanted to make evil with Mr. Lien or to settle a disagreement with the candidate.
In any event, known as Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election while directing suspicion on the DPP and while turning the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps that more the big winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to note how much the question continental part itself was absent.
Instead of that, the candidates have tournament with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence in fact and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its bonds with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from poking the feeling anti-Chinese.
It is the answer to a new awakening according to which the Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. My, for its part, asserted a confirmation to know if its policy relating to China were acceptable for the Taiwanese majority.
One can expect that the government of Beijing continues to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with his strategy which aims at deluding Taiwan, of return to the fold.
China did not waste time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a top on the protection of the investments and the medical co-operation.
Admittedly, she would also like to see an political integration; but let us start with the beginning.
Better is worth to wait for that after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP was in any event reinvented.
Two years ago, it was badly: its former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent in prison following accusations of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, he was an agitator in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderate was born under the direction of Mrs. Tsai and the PDP puts all works about it to attract the professionals and the young people.
Mrs. Tsai was greeted like a candidate of the DPP to the presidency, like Su Tseng-chang, which was useful under Mr. Chen.
Their party is making of sound to better show than him also can engage with Beijing.
Mrs. Tsai announced plans intended for a panel of experts to act like a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place unconditionally.
Mrs. Tsai tells with the Taiwanese public that its party presents a "alternative worthy of confidence" compared to the precipitated approach of Mr. My about China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a declaration published starting from its cell, he declared that the candidates of the PDP would have obtained better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a distinct country.
It even ordered with Mr. Su, pragmatic, not to aspire to the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have evil to choose between its potential candidates.
It is necessary that the KMT makes an introspection of oneself.
The evaluations of Mr. My were weak; in spite of a vertiginous economic growth, the candidates of the KMT did not want to make countryside with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be mainly due to the unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich person and the poor.
A spokesperson of the KMT says that his cabinet as its local antennas will be altered.
The good performances of the PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the bringing together is limited.
In same time, the majority of the Taiwaneses see economic integration with China like inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent leader-writer, "the point of nonreturn already passed."
Nominations with the Grammy Awards: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "better new artist"
To carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to take note.
Esperanza Spalding, the bass player of jazz and singer 26 year old gathered with the hand by president Obama to occur at the time of its ceremony of the Nobel Prize of Peace in 2009, marked one of surprised Grammy Awards this year with a nomination of great scale in the category of the "best new artist."
Considering that Spalding is a figure very known on the scene of the jazz since its album of 2008, "Esperanza," the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards according to which an artist should not leave more than three albums before the recording; what "proves the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," marked certainly a step ahead and, being given its vocal style slightly engaging, its skilful hand the pop one and of funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line with Spalding compared to the fulgurating success of Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent nearest for the voters to the Grammy Awards by taking account of the productions of jazz in this category these last years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honoured "Historicity" with Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "album instrumental," one transfered on a reinvigorating shiver of a recording which was one of the paramount favourites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of the saxophonist veteran James Moody and "Positootly" of the clavierist John Beasley will be in particular in competition.
Shorty trombone, favourite with the raucous voice of New-Orleans and frequent guest with "Treme" of HBO, were honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; who inclines himself in addition strongly towards an unquestionable fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Society secrecy of the savage Darcy James Wire-drawer, familiarized with the steampunk, gained some recognitions deserved well in the category great unit; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and the adventurous eternal Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of sound octet' S live was an good example of the democratic hand of this bass player as a team leader.
Nomination of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey carry out in the traditional categories
The traditional nominations for the 53e Grammy Awards annual comprise a mixture of landscapes of musicians and type-setters of the whole world.
At the head nominations, let us quote "Deus ex machina" of Michael Daugherty, for the piano and the orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes."
Among the nominated ones having bonds with California of the South, there is the Estonian type-setter Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles," a work which was ordered by the Philharmonic orchestra of Los Angeles and which opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Madolin Concerto of the type-setter based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in string for a reward.
The traditional nominations are distributed on 13 categories covering of the recordings of orchestra, opera, choral and in solo.
A category for the traditional producer of the year puts in the high-speed motorboat five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the traditional album are Symphonies N °3 and 4 of Bruckner of the royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus ex machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestrated; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestrated Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" putting in the high-speed motorboat various artists; and the "Requiem" of Made green of Chicago Symphony Orchestrated and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominated ones are "Excentric" of Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio E Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love by far" of Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Berlin Symphony-Orchester; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the National BBC Orchestrated Wales off.
The type-setters who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count Pärt for the Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus ex machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted."
The Symphony n°4 of Pärt had its first in Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Philharmonic orchestra of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-tycoon of oil Mikhaïl Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
"Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was nominated for its instrumental service soloist with an orchestra.
The type-setter of Los Angeles said that it aviat written work the 15 minute old especially for the interpreter to the mandoline Avi Avital, which played the concerto with Metropolis Ensemble, sitting at New York.
"I wrote it by using sounds of the Middle East and a great number of ranges and rates/rhythms of North Africa," declared Dorman in a telephone interview.
The leader Pierre Boulez, 85 years, received a nomination in the category of the services of orchestra, to have directed the Symphony orchestra of Chicago in a recording of works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination, let us quote the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs, the violonist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, it only did not nominate vocalistes-soloists there; here: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of the traditional mixtures, the soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the mosque of Temecula gains the approval of the commission of planning.
A project of mosque with Temecula received the unanimous support of the commission of local planning after more than five hours of public testimony, often impassioned.
Criticisms were caught some with the project by claiming that it made promotion as well terrorism as congestions of the traffic.
But the police chiefs ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected the local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Much from people well came to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention it," declared Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"That shows that justice carries it."
"The opposition is really tiny," it added.
"They have just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, of people deciding for or against the center, at the speaking time about also distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the Web site of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," wrote a speaker.
"It is about another planet of the monkeys with Miss Liberty died in sand."
"America fell."
The Islamic centers planned also caused protests in other parts of the country, including with Ground Zero, place of the attacks of September 11, 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of about 135 families coexists without incident in the county of Riverside since years but she wanted a space larger and better than the warehouse than she rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of systems of water filtration.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be made up of two minarets and would rise with 43 feet top.
It would occupy a site of 4,32 hectares on the Nicolas road approximately two miles in the east of the Chaparral college.
The opponents can still make call against this project at the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic like one of its nutritive elements, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that shows that the life has possibilities beyond the major elements which were regarded as essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can developed either with phosphorus, or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very particular, even if it is far from being a form of life really" étrangère" , Paul Davies C.W commented on. University of State of Arizona, joint author of the report/ratio appearing in the online edition of Thursday of the Science newspaper.
Six major elements were regarded a long time as essential for the life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers discovered that the bacterium, discovered in the lake Mono, in California, is able to continue to develop after having replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," Ariel Anbar D. of the University of State of Arizona declared, joint author of the report/ratio.
The discovery is important as regards research of the life beyond the Earth because the researchers must be able to recognize the life, of knowing it with what the life resembles, says Anbar.
The study concentrates on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the advertisement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the lucky find, generated speculations spread on the Internet according to which the report/ratio could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, the organizations could be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that" the standard "whole of the elements, that we judge absolutely necessary for the life, could not be fixed," commented on Charles Cockell, professor at the planetary scientific Research institute and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom.
Cockell did not form part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology of NASA, which directed the study, chose the lake Mono because it is equipped with arsenic elevated levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, the organizations have evil to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different so that it does not function exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, to some extent, gum the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacterium known under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic in the place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, that is to say elsewhere on Earth or another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamy S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing shown forever that could go.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, says it; thus, the researchers put forth the assumption that the first forms of life could have used it.
That suggests that there could be other ways of forming the life, not only the way in which the life on Earth was formed with the début" , Foster declared, which did not form part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
Research was financed by NASA, the ministry for Energy and the National institute of health.
The last two stolen dogs of exposure were found in Compton
The two other dogs of exposure on four stolen of the outside of a motel to Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the county of Los Angeles have it advertisement Thursday.
The four dogs of exposure - two akitas and two corgis Welsh pembroke - disappeared Tuesday when somebody stole the van Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, declared in Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news, it is that the dogs are well," known as Whitmore.
"They are in the fine shapes."
"They were restored with their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to precisely say where the dogs had been found, in which district and which were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is in hand."
"We do not want to say it," Whitmore has it says.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were joined together Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals of the county located at Downey.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately with Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a 3 year old male, and Didi, a 10 month old female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had envisaged to show with regional contests this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, which live in Redding, are downtown this weekend within the framework of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" Beach Length, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were awaited to take part in the competitions of other tests envisaged in the days preceding the exposure "AKC/Eukanuba," declared Peek in Times Wednesday.
California of the South east one of the stops of the round of canine exposure of almost a month of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often remain in the motels and park their van outside, just beside the window of their room.
They took along three other dogs - a Boxer pup, a burrow Parson Russell and a Breton spaniel - which remained with them in the room of the motel.
But they left Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be fresher.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced the flight of the van to 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to any person who could lead them to the corgis, provided with a micropuce established to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward were granted Thursday.
The lion is not ready to redden again, the reorganization of MGM does not await any more but the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulences and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained green light to start again to zero.
A federal judge of the bankruptcies of New York, officially rented Thursday the plan "prepackaged" by the creditors according to whom approximately 5 billion dollars of the debt would be unobtrusive; opening the way with the company of entertainment, being 86 years old of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and film distribution and of television programs.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan satisfied the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, plus any legal obstacle do not remain in front of MGM to recover to flood under the supervision of the founders from Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the managing directors of what will be a reduced studio.
The personnel will be brought back to approximately 320 out of 400 at the beginning.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not have concluded a credit facilities from 500 million dollars, designed to finance the new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently distributed under licence by the bank of investment, which encounters itself 75 million dollars, and should be financed towards mid-December.
The process of reorganization of the studio began in May 2009 when the bank from investment Moelis & Co. was committed to advise the direction on the way of placing its finances since it did not have the means of paying the interests per annum rising to 300 million dollars.
In August, the managing director, Harry Sloan, were replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former chairman of Enron and an expert in rectification known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and to satisfy the most 140 creditors of the studio took much more time than envisaged.
After several months of discussions, the parts were appropriate, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few tenderers among whom none of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 billion more whose creditors were with research.
For the spring of this year, it was necessary all to remake whereas the team of MGM had started to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of dissensions and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM leaves officially the bankruptcy in the following weeks, the companies Moelis and Cooper receive premiums of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which already obtained 1,2 million dollars, will receive a payment of 9,5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, which collected 375.000 $ per month for their services of management of the firm, will receive a "premium of success" of 4 million dollars.
To bore and Birnbaum intends to start again the production of MGM, which left one film this year, and to put on foot an annual list of seven or eight films which would leave as from 2012.
They also intend to cofinance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a distinct loan between $ 265.000.000 and $ 275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be carried out by Peter Jackson.
The Carl Icahn investor, who holds approximately 18% of the debt of MGM, tried to carry out a fusion of the studio with Lions Spoils Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to maintain your budget gifts in balance
Although the principal candidate for the most marvellous toy of this year is the IPAD, follow-up, perhaps, by the system of video game of Microsoft, Kinect, both can make an important breach in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five bicycles BMX to 99 $ and that a play Kinect costs the same price as 10 skipping ropes traditional of pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways of keeping your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national salesmen of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Custom and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys which I could buy for less than 80 $.
It is clear that Law de Moore evolved/moved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more force; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Moreover, whereas there are generally less new toys associated with Web sites, two of most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the pile button toys are in increase, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here some recommendations.
(All the prices are starting from Toys "R" Custom, except if contrary indication.)
Sing-have-my-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ per 3 years and more) are soft toys of the size of a guinea-pig which sing a note when you to press to them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second makes it possible to compose a song.
If you to buy some several, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: once you start to support, you cannot any more stop you.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, 60 $ per 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Taking as a starting point the technology of Elmo Live of last year, the animatronic headstock of 14 inches plays of the plays in turn like Simon Says and can make the lunar dance thanks to its articulated feet innovating with wheel locking.
The children who essyaé the toy uses Mickey as an instructor of dance whereas their parents complain about a lack of control of volume.
If you are a child of the Eighties, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is of return (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 $ per 3 years and more), with a rucksack filled of charts of play questionnaire designed to transform one strolls in the car in a session with an autocorrection and a sorter of valves.
If you are being wary when your child holds your smartphone, here three autonomous alternatives.
Mobigo de VTech (60 $, for the 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easiest to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although the plays do not educate as effectively as To explore it Leapster (70 $, for the 3 to 12 years), it acts of the first great revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price (90 $, for the 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the iTunes type to offer plays and e-books and is equipped with an entry for chart SD which makes it possible to post family photos.
Lastly, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for the 8 years and more) is a whole of five blocks hardly larger than a box of matches, each one having its own screen LED.
The objective is to form words while placing the blocks on line before time does not pass, it is ideal impromptu for a contest of orthography.
More and more, the toys have a kind of connection on line.
While basing itself only on their presence in the stores of toys, two larger are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy with your child a pet in line of the Penguin Club, for example, you can obtain Penguin Disney Club 2" Mix 'NR Match Appears Pack, 5 $, for the 6 to 12 years) which includes/understands a marked part of a hidden code.
When you to repurchase the code on line, your child receives sufficient appropriations to the store Club Penguin for two articles with the choices.
It can be a question of roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your brush with teeth, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is last the pile button microphone-robots.
The false small beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It is amusing to make a labyrinth of blocks to see whether it can find its way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall of the kitchen table and even a temporary passage in the mouth of our dog.
To bring a softer side to the maintenance of law and order to China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a place of the city like one sergeant urban with the drive by inspecting its nervous loads severely, while emitting with low voice of the orders with a military authority.
He wanted that the female members of chengguan - responsible imposing for the law and order in China, feared and scorned for their arbitrary repression and their leaning for violence - transmit a certain impression to a whole of spectators.
"You Hold right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show, says to them it, "what resemble the pretty girls!"
Four girls having hardly passed adolescence out of white gloves, vêtues of jackets and identical trousers of color olive, solidified with the attention.
Four pairs of black shoes with heel, rows with the rule.
Four looked after hats perfectly perched at the top of hair attached by a node striped in blue and white.
"Personally, I think that they have an average appearance," Mr. Tang said, with scorn.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city required that all the new recruits have a diploma of higher learning.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the greenish grey of the uniforms against a blue supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-the-eyes by the strong manner:: in 2009, a report/ratio announced that 50 officers had encircled an unverifiable snack bar carriage while launching black looks, firmly during half an hour, until the hawker remballe his business and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680.000 inhabitants with Chengdu, chose to make a great operation of image.
Since 2003, the district supplemented its police force of street in urban environment of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, their contour and their young age.
The idea is to give to the trimmed police force a softer side, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties in attract the glance on this underground urban brigade of China
And due, the critics will say.
Contrary to the police force, these agents are authorized to only make respect the municipal ordinances by imposing administrative fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat with died an observer after it used its cellphone to film them dispersing a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for the inspectors of Beijing, concealed and put on line, described how to overcome the delinquents without emitting effectively blood.
This year in Shanghai, a water melon hawker was abandoned with a cerebral lesion after a brawl with five officers.
A video game impregnated of violence, available by remote loading in line, watch of the Chinese inspectors trained with the attack of the salesmen of street.
"Chengguan marked the government," deplored last year China Daily, a national publication, after one énième polemic on the tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning."
The skeptics say that the approach is well far.
After the district passed an advertisement in October to find eight new recruits female, a leading article, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether the women had real tasks or if they were only one tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The advertisement of the district required female, old candidates between 18 to 22 years, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in good the order."
They must have a size higher than the average, that is to say of 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at 26 years is obligatory.
The officers declared that work was physically too painful for the women of more than 25 years.
"It is their image which is important," a certain officer of district said to Rednet.com, a Web site quasi-governmental.
"Firstly, qualities external of the candidates will determine if they agree; they are the size, the weight, the features of the face, etc"
Then the temperament and "interior qualities come."
The women of Chengguan are like vases with flowers, has it says, adding: " In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, assistant editor of the office of management of the district of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But it noted that the requirements concerning the height were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for the two sexes.
Such is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the features of the face.
That means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Admittedly, the handicapped or disfigured people should not postulate.
"We cannot leave a person who limps or uneven to come to be useful here," Mr. Zheng says.
"It would not give an good image."
Liu Yi, which patrols on the Baoguang place close to a monastery, is old of 22 and finely has the dappled cheeks with a mouth curved.
She does not regard the development of her appearance as being sexist, At she says.
"Do you Think that I have the sexy air in this uniform?" she asked of a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his/her colleague with the 21 years old small cavities, known as: "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed so that their mandate is limited, said, because they nourish greater ambitions of career than simply to drive out the salesmen in the lanes where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who move quickly with foot or bicycle, while trying as much as possible to sell bread rolls or bowls of tofu before escaping.
"Main Wang, you must leave."
"We already said it to you several times!" , Mrs. Xu said whereas a salesman fled with foot, giving up her bicycle-cart with noodles temporarily.
The agents rather describe their functions like monotonous that difficult.
"It is about the same thing each day," declared Huang Jing, 20 years old, which studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that the female agents do not have the capacity of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the salesmen.
They can only threaten to announce the contraveners to their male superiors.
That tends to protect them from the exposures public sudden of animosity against the bureaucracy which are common in all China.
This year, of the hundreds of citizens with Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the propagation of false rumours according to which the agents of the chengguan had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than one dozen of police officers and agents of the chengguan were wounded, 14 vehicles of the government were reversed or put at fire.
Xindu has escaped up to now with such a violence.
But the calm one is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of houses of the placid Baoguang place, where the officers of female sex patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered with the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motor bike which was being repaired on the pavement rather than in a store, like theirs imposes the regulation.
The owner of the motor bike shouted with the scandal.
A 15 minute old arm wrestling followed before the police officers, with the sinister face, cut through a path with blows of elbow towards their vehicle and left at any speed with the motor bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, its white badge turned over to hide its name.
Like the officers of female sex, the coordinators - 40 years old men or more - play a part of support purely.
Contrary to them, they are not formed in order to maintain an image waxed.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," says Mr. Li said of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public which starts."
The prosecutors will not accuse the senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the ministry for Justice raised the criminal charges related to the senator John Ensign, rising from a business related to an assistant of an old campaign and on its efforts to obtain a work of lobbying for the husband of the woman, have advertisement Wednesday the lawyers of the senator.
The decision puts an end to the legal threat most serious faced by Mr. Ensign, the republican of Nevada which was regarded as a possible republican candidate with presidential of 2012 until the scandal around its business does not make the national headlines last year and harm its career.
The office of Mr. Ensign declared that it was "very happy" by the decision, result of a one year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed with disciplinary measures taken by the senatorial committee of ethics.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign declared that the ministry for Justice "had informed that the senator Ensign was not any more the object of the investigation and that it did not intend to maintain of unspecified charge against him in this business."
The ministry for Justice abstained from comment on this subject.
The advertisement came like a kind of surprised for many lawyers of ethics external with the ministry for the Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal penal prohibition on the lobbying.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents, initially communicated in October 2009 in NewYork Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, which was one of its assistants, to obtain a work of lucrative lobbying to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in connection with the business of the senator with it.
Mrs. Hampton once was useful as trésorière at the time of a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a certain number of political backers to find work for Mr. Hampton and, then, it defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them; in accordance with the documents and with the interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, it was to him interdict for one year by the law to make lobbying near its former employer or of the Senate as a whole.
The experts in ethics supported that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the business, seems in contradiction with the prohibition known as of the revolving door of the lobbying.
According to the proof which was made public, "it seems to have a proof preceded facie of a plot there in order to violate and of substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," declared Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington which specializes in the defense of customers of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the ministry refused to explain the reasoning having led to the decision in the Ensign business, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics said that the ministry seemed to be wary of the political continuations after a certain number of high level reverses boxed by its section of the public integrity, including the decision taken year last to give up the continuations against the former senator Ted marked Stevens of fault of continuation.
The federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take the weapons, declared Melanie Sloan, the managing director of the citizens for the responsibility and ethics in Washington, an defense group which received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the business.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials edge now assumes the laws don' T apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, lawyer principal of Mr. Ensign, declared in an interview that it had received Monday a phone call on behalf of a prosecutor of the ministry for Justice and a follow-up the following day, saying to him that the ministry did not seek charges against its customer.
The team of lawyers of Mr. Ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, such as his office reaffirmed it Wednesday in an official statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments which it had made with the parquet floor.
"I am not at ease to go into the details of my discussions with the ministry for Justice, except saying that we think that they made the good decision," At it says.
Last month, the federal Commission of the Elections decided to give up an investigation following a complaint independent by the group of ethics, supporting that the payment of 96.000 $ by the parents of Mr. Ensign in Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission declared that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important company of Nevada which supported the senator a long time, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find work of lobbying.
Email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company accomodated Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the principal private secretary of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and said to him that it "hammered" the ministry for the Interior on a question in litigation.
Mr. Ensign also took part in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of transport to fix a meeting in the name of the airline company after having urged Mr. Hampton to make lobbying.
When the news of the business made surface last year, Mr. Ensign excused himself near his voters and resigned of his post of leader to the fourth republican rank with the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign declared it has been two weeks that it intended to aspire to a third mandate with the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was not any more the target of an criminal investigation, its spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, declared that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the ministry for Justice and would put an end to its investigation.
The senator Ensign is delighted to continue his work baited in the name of the people of Nevada, says it.
The call of Cheshire will point towards Twitter
A half-dozen of them were typing with far in the lines of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of the horrible reports/ratios of testimonys via Twitter.
To the end, defense said that there was more than 140.000 messages on the lawsuit of the rape case and the children attached to their bed in a house which was burnt.
Thursday, the lawsuit largely followed by Steven J. Beam, which was recognized guilty of the murder of three Cheshire family members, in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the capital punishment, voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already to deposit elements with the court which outline arguments of call, likely to occupy the courts during years.
What is provocant, they is that the intense reports on the lawsuit - as well as use the generalized and extended by the journalists of Twitter - created a "atmosphere of circus," a so widespread and instantaneous saturation with details flamers which the jury was badly influenced by passions of the public.
The request could push the judges of call to be discussed on the question of knowing if new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I made of it the experiment at the time of this lawsuit; I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the courtrooms undermines the rights of the person to a fair trial," declared Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, lawyer chief.
The judge of the lawsuit, Jon C. Blue of the Superior court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgement made the week last, affirming that the media "were carefully controlled" and that there was no proof according to which the jury would have been animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The courses of call recognize decades since that the press coverage of the notorious cases can raise questions about the equity of a lawsuit.
In a judgement of 1966 which made date, the Supreme court of the United States cancelled the judgment of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the assassination of his wife, supporting in her decision that there was a "atmosphere of carnival to the lawsuit" because of the media.
The crime is considered by certain to have been the inspiration for the television program and film "the fugitive one."
Certain lawyers declared that the courts of call seized to re-examine a half century later the judgment of Mr. Hayes can be curious being given the argument according to which new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"It there has a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the lawsuits of great scale, declared John J. Donohue III, a professor at the school of Right of Stanford which studied the capital punishment in Connecticut and wrote a report/ratio according to which she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue affirms that certain judges of call could be intrigued by the idea according to which the limitation of the instantaneous communication starting from the courtrooms could allow lawsuits righter.
The case of Twitter only one among many others is described of it by lawyers of Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed during years; what delays the execution.
The defense counsels also affirm, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when Blue judge refused to allow them to put to the test the reactions potential jurors in their showing macabre photographs of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of sworn stated to be horrified by the photographs at the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Small, 48 years, and his/her daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years.
The defense counsels affirm that they also will dispute the constitutionality of the capital punishment and that they will support that the judge wrongfully expelled one of sworn, which had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and which it wrongly put the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to lead the jury to deliberate in one weekend.
Sworn were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense press coverage of the lawsuit could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, deposited last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that he was discussed during the electoral campaign by the candidates at the station of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the data-processing media did not cease poking the flames of the emotion of the business.
"The daily scuffle of the tweets of the media, the cameras and the journalists in front of the law courts," wrote lawyers, "did not resemble nothing of what had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even with the national scales."
Their accent on the cover of the Twitter system is discussed.
In the interviews, certain journalists declared that the assertion, according to whom the instantaneous news was more flamers than the official statements given more slowly, was a sight luddist which would impoverish the policy of the Court governing the press coverage of the future lawsuits.
But certain lawyers declared that the courses of call étaitent often attracted by the arguments according to which the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the decision of the Supreme court of 1966 which had reversed the judgment of Dr. Sheppard because of the press coverage of the lawsuit and they specified that they would call upon the need for new rules for the new media.
"This business," wrote ," represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21e century. "
Can civility bring closer cleavages?
After a campaign marked by the invective and negativity, a minimum of civility burst in Washington this week.
Is it about a harbinger of a true bipartite co-operation forwards or one illusory moment before the rapid return with the fight partisane in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any opening on the great questions which must be treated during the session of "lame duck."
But obviously, there at least was a polished discussion on the differences of the two parts like on the recognition of their shared responsibilities being controlled, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. vacuum of notation not in favour.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the commission on the deficit of the president was also civilized, in spite of the political divergences which remain between the members.
It seems clear that the narrow interaction several months created a mutual respect transcending the ideological ditch; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly sufficient to declare that a new era of co-operation arrived.
The two parts are now during a trial period and of testing period mutual in order to obtain signs of co-operation and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed war partisane.
This is why the meeting of Tuesday and the later comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a fast change of the climate which existed during the two last years.
That they are the taxation, the expenditure, the health care or the rights, the two parts remain away miles.
However, the election of November had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is not any doubt that the things changed on the tone," Pete Wehner, a civil servant of the Bush administration declared, maintaining at the side of the Center of ethical and public Policy.
" It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections cause passions partisanes and, then, they are estomptent.
It is bien."
On certain questions, in particular those about the day order of "the lame" duck session, the republicans and the democrats have of another choice only to find a solution.
The tax reductions of Bush will expire with the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of that.
The two parts want to find a way of preserving a part of it or the unit, in a permanent or temporary way.
In the same way, a compromise is possible on the extension of the unemployment pays, would be this only because the republicans cannot allow themselves to give the impression which they are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich person, while refusing the unemployment benefits to the workers without employment.
After the meeting of Tuesday at the White House, more optimism planes on a possible agreement in connection with the questions mentioned during the session relative to "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston, of Brookings Institution, informs that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session "blade duck" will not lead inevitably to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112e congress meets in January.
Instead of that, he says, one period of dissension is probable, even inevitable.
"Once the things which must be made it will be, psychology in the short term will return to the one of confrontations," has it says.
Wehner also expressed its skepticism largely divided according to which civility would lead to a true co-operation.
" I consider the majority from what occurs between today and 2012 like a pre-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the principal event from 2012, At it says.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority to the Room and the voters present at the who contributed to his creation.
However the republican leaders are conscious of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be with the height of their promises to reduce the public expenditure and to repeal the new law on the health care.
These positions partisanes are right now clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the commission of the deficit which include/understand to reform the code of imposition and to increase certain taxes, to push back the retirement age and to reduce the expenditure.
The copresidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the question of the deficit about the public diary in a manner which cannot be been unaware of.
But they need 14 vote at the commission, made up of 18 members, to emit their plan like an official recommendation, and they had evil to reach this number.
Greatest resistance remains among the elected officials of the group; what suggests that there is on the tax questions, at least today, few reasons or will for compromise.
Galston envisages two phases in the engagements between the White House and the republicans of the Congress.
The first will come the next year in the form from confrontations in favour, since the republicans dispute Obama as regards budget, of taxes and health care; for then being followed by one period of greater bipartite co-operation.
Which would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is largely proven that, in spite of the spirit in favour of the recent election, a majority of the Americans wants to always see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as in 1995, then the two parties will observe the reaction of the public attentively.
That which will be judged in loss will have to change course and to find compromises.
But it would be nevertheless an optimistic point of view.
The spirit in favour and polarization are larger today than they were it in the middle of the years 1990 and there seems to be more an ideological wide variation between Obama and the republicans of the Congress that there was not then between president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
In same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 like a simple prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
Taking into account this reality, exposed civility this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But one will need much more efforts on behalf of the two parts to find an area of agreement on the questions which still divide them.
Revealed American documents describe Moscow like a harbour of corruption
The control of the east city between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes pass to the Kremlin part of the bribes and money of protection which it collects, announced the embassy of the United States in Russia in a note in February.
The police force and the Federal security service carry out enormous rackets which contribute to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow, has it says.
They collect money not only of legitimate companies but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what the Vladimir Poutine Prime Minister called the "vertical of the capacity" - takes its share whereas the money walks on to the top of the scale.
The memorandum, which was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names were expurgés.
It was written whereas Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is mainly held responsible for corruption.
It was congédié in October by president Dmitri Medvedev but there since then were little traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, which has a building firm of foreground, always denied the accusations of corruption during the years; and it gained several lawsuits in slandering on these charges.
In September, he declared what follows to a Russian television channel, when it was questioned on documentary suggesting that it was corrupted: "It is insane, it is to throw, it is anything."
The Russians believe, with one crushing majority, that their company is corrupted; according to the surveys.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in a report of embassy; and it is amazing to conceive that would be with diplomats of a foreign country to do it.
The direct link drawn up between the government of the town of Moscow and criminality led certain people to name it "dysfonctionnel" and to affirm that the government functioned more like a kleptocratie a gouvernement" , according to the note of the embassy.
"The criminal elements enjoy a" krysha " (term used in the world criminel/la Maffia which means" roof " literally; or protection) which passes through the police force, Federal security service (FSB), the ministry for the Interior (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, like through all the bureaucracy of the government of the town of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a structure in three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"the FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the corrupted inspectors are on the level low."
"It is about an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fills a vacuum in certain fields where the city does not provide certain services."
The report/ratio indicates that the FSB brews the money of the more large companies and that the police force target the small ones.
A source, has it says, "explained why the owners of company of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than of the groups of the organized crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and to be able more that the criminal groups but they are also protected by the law. "
"This is why the request for protection by the criminal gangs is not also any more high."
The note announces that, although the collection of the money is wide, protection itself can be unequal; even those which pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those which do not pay quickly see their business closing under a pretext or another.
Medvedev evoked several times the fight against corruption but he admitted the little of progress.
The note of the embassy transmits reports making state of men who bring bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," declared in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think Indem tank" of Moscow.
"But it belongs to this bureaucracy."
"It does not form part of a political community because there are not some in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, separation of the capacities, it has says, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption would rise, on the scale of very whole Russia, more than 300 billion dollars per annum.
The country was classified 154e in a recent survey on the total perception of corruption by the governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least with most corrupted).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which has was carried out only yesterday, late in the Moscow evening, time, will stir up with certainty of dissatisfactions within the Russian government; although Loujkov can be blamed, to a certain extent, for the failures of Moscow, that could be the occasion for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin put forth the assumption that the documents of WikiLeaks could be a manufacture and reacted with anger in front of the remarks that diplomats of the United States had revealed by calling it Batman and by bringing closer Medvedev to Robin.
" The problem rests on the fact that it is about our interaction, big factor of the interior policy in this country, says it.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be carried out with such an arrogance, such a pressure and, you know it, in opposition to ethics."
War veterans of the Khmer Rouges obliged to face the past
In a badly enlightened classroom with decrepit concrete walls of bad quality, the secondary principal of Anlong Veng evoked the man who had built it, the last chief of the Khmer Rouges, Your Mok.
"Everyone here likes Your Mok."
"It was a leading good; and he was concerned with his people," declared Sreng Kor My, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when it was with the head of the Khmer Rouges, this commander remains popular in this bastion isolated from former Khmer Rouges in the North-West of Kampuchea where it made build hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization live still today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouges went to the government, the honesty of long time is finally called into question to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation made it possible the victims to publicly face with people who had taken part in the mode.
In June, the government distributed to it a handbook of high school which, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouges to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Kampuchean court, jointly directed with the United Nations, pronounced its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouges, by condemning, at 35 years of prison, the former chief of sadly celebrates center of torture of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known under the name of "Duch."
In front of this evolution of the situation, the anxiety increased near the war veterans of the Khmer Rouges of Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate itself in the Kampuchean company.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouges but they is impotent to do anything," declared Chhang Youk, director of the Information center of Kampuchea, an independent organism which undertakes research on the mode.
"For them, the life under the Khmer Rouges was glorious but the mode became a symbol of the evil."
"The situation generates divisions within the families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouges in Kampuchea, of 1975 to 1979, approximately 1,7 million people were carried out or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnameses invaded and reversed the Pot-Plain government of pol. in 1979, the remainder of the mode and its army fled towards the border of Kampuchea with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection which lasted until the last of the movements goes in December 1998.
Whereas Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla of their base located in the mountains of the West of Kampuchea and in the jungle, Your Mok prepared one following Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the years 1990, after an peace agreement sponsored by UNO led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, of great groups of Khmer Rouge combatants started to make defection with the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Your Mok, which had held head, was captured by the governmental forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for his lawsuit.
Without their benefactors, the majority of the Khmer Rouge war veterans sank in the utter destitution, commune with the rural regions of Kampuchea; and many are those which remain nostalgic movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge officers of elite kept their posts of local leader in exchange to have deposited the weapons, it acts farmers not qualified with the low rank and file.
"These people profited from very little follow-up after the capitulation," declared Sok Leang of the Center for justice and the reconciliation which organizes public forums in all Kampuchea, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked with the agrarian utopian ideology of the mode."
"They were high within a framework where to make deals is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, which joined the Khmer Rouges like teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 like poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouges was good," has it says.
"Your Mok nourishes everyone."
But now, the life is difficult because we must provide for our clean besoins."
The court of the Khmer Rouges in progress also caused concern here.
The court would have, with the beginning of the year next, to start the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and of his wife, Ieng Thirith, another Khmer Rouge former minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the top-ranking executives and the principal persons in charge of the crimes but it does not have says if it continued beyond these four cases.
It would be necessary some more to calm fears with Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, old of 64 years, former chief of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouges in the years 1970.
In 2007, she said to the researchers of the Information center of Kampuchea which she had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, at the time of one evening torrid, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located close to its house out of wooden on pile, on a dirt track apart from Anlong Veng.
Whereas the sun threw long shades on desiccated grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss its past within the Khmer Rouges.
If the court convened it, she says, it would refuse to go there.
"Kampuchea is in peace and stable," At it says.
"If there are more continuations, there will be the war."
The Hun Sen Prime Minister, who made defection of the Khmer Rouges in 1978, also informed on several occasions that an instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although the experts and the historians dispute that.
" Kampuchea must dig a hole and to bury the past, At it says.
But to face the past is all that Kampuchea must do to go from the front one, known as Youk Chhang, of the information center.
" The reconciliation in terms Khmer is of reconnecter the broken pieces, says it.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can include/understand."
The center produced the first handbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouges, "a history of democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It distributed it to Anlong Veng in June like supplement with the handbooks of history of the minister of education, designed for the high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouges.
As in the majority of Kampuchea, the young people of Anlong Veng know only some details about the Khmer Rouges, in spite of the bonds of the city to the mode.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, studying at the high school of Anlong Veng, declared that the new handbook helped the students to include/understand an important part of their history.
But his/her parents reacted with skepticism when it returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the handbook and the court," says it.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how much people the court will continue."
Such a resistance made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang declared.
But the public forums, the handbook and the court start to have an impact, At it says.
However, the Khmer Rouges preserve one atrait powerful here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a way, invaded by bad grasses and strewn with plastic bags, led to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pot was flaring here on a pile of tires after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, saleswoman of cellphone in edge of road, said that it did not know any much about the man who was incinerated at this place.
" But it has a great mind; and from many inhabitants there will request, says it.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, later this day, it envisaged to go towards the last place of rest of Pol Pot where it would leave a ripe banana bouquet in the hope bring chance.
Bielorussia agrees to give up its uranium stock of military quality
The government of Bielorussia announced Wednesday that it was going to give up its uranium stock highly enriched, an essential component for the nuclear weapons; this décison lies within the scope of a surprised victory of the countryside of president Obama to make safe the nuclear matters in the whole world
The agreement was revealed in a joint news release published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Belorusse Foreign Minister here, Sergei Martynov, in margin of a top on safety.
The US government had tried during years to convince Bielorussia to give up uranium highly enriched and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But the American persons in charge declared in Washington Post that certain classified operations were carried out with Bielorussia during the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds from the military uranium of quality starting from a research centre of Bielorussia.
That opened the way with a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder from the matter of approximately 500 pounds, according to a civil servant who evoked the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear security of 47 nations, organized on the initiative of Obama; where Bielorussia was excluded.
Apparently, it was advantageous to get an invitation with the Soviet ex-republic following the top, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Top of Nuclear security of 2012 Sommet nuclear power of safety."
"That proves to me that this process functions," declared Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for world safety, a group of promotion of the nuclear security.
Clinton qualified the agreement "of very significant, important stage" carried out by Bielorussia.
Obama was committed in Prague in April 2009 making safe all the vulnerable nuclear matters throughout the world in the four years to come.
Since then, the US government helped six countries to get rid of all their uranium highly enriched.
Bielorussia would be the seventh.
A dozen country did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on the nuclear security of Obama, the Belorusse president, Alexandre Loukachenko, stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We kept uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilogrammes of what is primarily of the military uranium of quality and slightly enriched uranium," Mr. Loukachenko said then.
"It is our product... Us will not manufacture dirty bombs, and we will sell it to nobody."
"We will use it at ends of research, it is all."
Bielorussia approached the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest to manage an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Bielorussia, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, indicated persons in charge.
It was charged on a special train which traversed more than 1.300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and eliminated, indicated persons in charge.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the persons in charge.
The US government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, mainly to replace the installations of research of Bielorussia with slightly enriched uranium; misfit for the weapons.
"A meticulous coordination and an organization were implemented in order to reinforce confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, declared Andrew Bieniawski, a person in charge of the department of energy specialized in the Reduction of the world Threat.
According to the estimates of the Center of Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Bielorussia had this year at least 88 pounds of military uranium of quality, as well as hundreds of kilos of uranium highly enriched.
Bielorussia seeks to eliminate its stocks from here at 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Bielorussia and the United States are tightened since years, mainly because of hard repression by Loukachenko of the Human rights.
But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"All while being pleased with progress on these questions of security world, the United States and Bielorussia recognized that a respect increased for the democracy and the Human rights in Bielorussia remained essential to improve the bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she declared.
The government did not emit any objection with the flights of the CIA
The government did not emit any objection with the flights of the CIA with prisoners Talibans and Al Qaeda in Guantanamo direction through Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the ambassador from the United States in Madrid.
That is shown by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks with the daily newspaper El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of this time, María Teresa Fernández of Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed for "pouvoir' to show that they exerted an adequate vigilance on the foreign planes which crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report/ratio of the Council of Europe which showed complicity in contrary practices with the human rights with a dozen country, among which Spain, took place a meeting between the former North-American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega.
The vice-president recognized that the report/ratio of the Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero off-side" and insisted on the fact that Spain had nothing there to hide.
"Of Vega stressed that Spain does not have an objection with regard to the flights of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They want to only be informed" to prevent that one "takes them with deprived," Aguirre in a cable reports.
The holder of the Ministry of External of this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, announced to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this business profiles it low possible, even if, as it was with the hands of the judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence."
In his turn, to January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that it was not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of the documents of the National centre of Intelligence (CNI) and of the ministry for Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports/ratios contain any accusing element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States showed nevertheless their concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for déclassifiée information of CNI O of the ministry for Defense.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly operate the case between the Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Interns, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider adequate," it had given instructions to his/her collaborators "so that they avoid the comments of an ignited rhetoric, while trying to lower again the temperature."
The ambassador expresses also his concern for the action of PP in this business.
"In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experiment suggests the fact that PP certainly will benefit from any indication according to which the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately been unaware of the actions of the United States which could be interpreted like possible violations of the human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," announces it.
The parricide who passed to the consents felt sorry for in network of the "overwhelming pressure" to be mother
The young girl spoke about the child when he had already died and it had a blog: "Terror with Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname which it uses as soon as it was small, communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two originating ones in Noia, the village of Coruña in which it is originating.
The messages go back to 2008.
To hear them, it is necessary to know its love life, that ABC built with the assistance of testimonys of his parents.

The members of the Popular party would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9 of them
With the results of the 18-N, PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After l' important increase in votes and deputies recorded in last the autonomic elections, PP Catalan already aimed at the general ones because, even s' there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes which this formation obtains in these comices doubles that normally qu' it receives in the Catalan women.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes with general of 2008, while with autonomic from 2006, they had obtained 316.222 from them.
Sunday spent, the PC obtained 384.091 votes.
If l' one maintains this tendency ascending, desired d' a diversion of votes of the PSC and the development of consumer loyalty of l' electorate of PP, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, s' there would be general elections, the PC could passed from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would gain of them also four (it has 10 now of them) and PSC would lose some neither more nor less than 9 deputies (he has 25 of them).
These calculate would note that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to l' analyzes the popular ones, ERC would lose a deputy - it has three of them now - while ICV would keep a deputy or one would gain some.
But if l' diary electoral is maintained, the next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the municipal comices, where the popular ones can also be decisive at the end of l' socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and their relay with the head of the General advice of Barcelona, one of the administrations which handles the higher budget - 661 d' million; euros for 2011-.
Such an amount of the nationalists as the popular ones is d' agreement with the fact that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists n' would obtain the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
By taking account of the rout republican, it would not be whimsical that this formation loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary d' to obtain the 5% of the votes.
PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact qu' they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they controlled with PP before l' current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP recorded only one difference in 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintain very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last countryside, they were found several times.
The popular ones recorded progress also in others municipes important like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, PP is present in 34 municipal governments at Catalogne and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports with Al-Qaida
Separately the seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three of it
Seven Pakistani and the native of Niger held by agents of the general police station d' Information of the Police force of Barcelona formed a cell jihadist which, directed as of Thailand, facilitated passports with different groups Al-Qaida, between which " Tigers for the Release of the Tamil" Earth; (LTTE) and " Laskar E Taiba" (Let), the last being l' author of the attacks of Bombay which caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry for the Interns gave a great importance to these investigations, at the point of s' to ensure of the fact qu' with " l' Kampai" operation; " has; summer débilité" l' apparatus of falsification d' Al-Qaida with international level and " consequently, its capacity opérative."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups which integrated the criminal galaxy Al-Qaida so that its " combattants" can pass the European borders and d' other countries Western with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell n' is only that the network jihadist held operative in Europe, the c' is for that in the investigations took part, with share of the services inhabitants of Thailand, d' other European police units, c' is why in the territory of l' European Union it could have there the following days of the blows similar to that recorded the night of Tuesday spent to Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (l' one held the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the native of Niger Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand one unrolled another, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the inhabitant of Thailand Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They stays those which directed from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and in d' other European countries.
The Catalan network - of which a part was struck in 2009 - stole mainly of the tourists the passports which satisfied the conditions marked by named the " Mondial" Islamic front;.
C' be-with saying the documents were to be with name of old young men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
The investigators stress that jusqu' now l' one n' found any detail which connects the prisoners in Catalonia with l' attack of Bombay, even if l' author of this attack, " Laskar E Taiba" , was one of the receiving groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless it should be recalled the fact that a few days before that this attack is made, of Catalonia l' one sent through an agency of transfers some miles of dollars which were " investis" to buy charts of mobiles which were used afterwards by the integral ones of the " commando" who killed 106 people.
The Police force s' d' is seized; an abundant documentation.
PP requires of Mas qu' it suspends tax complicity
The leader of PC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had l' occasion yesterday d' to personally expose to Artur Mas her conditions to support her nomination as a president of Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the countryside and which are summarized to give priority to the recovery of l' economy and the d' lack; adventures philosophy-souverainistes as is economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach with half of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at go with Artur Mas with the safety which gives the fact d' to have obtained 18 deputies with the elections Sunday spent, a number than sufficient to be more made like, because the candidate of CiU requires qu' at least one of formations qu will exert l' oppositions s' abstains in the voting from l' nomination.
D' a possible agreement with PP depend future alliances which the nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the remainder of political leaders are done out of Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of PP, to support a nomination " it would be necessary to eliminate all the speeches souverainists and indépendantistes" , and economic complicity - similar to that of the Pays Basque - that the convergent leader wishes to subject even to the referendum.
The two leaders in common have their bet to make lose l' political apparatus d' a very exaggerated autonomic administration and l' elimination of l' tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on l' nomination of Farmhouse s' will occupy on behalf of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Farmhouse s' is joined together already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and aujourd' today it will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).

Persons in charge of geriatric Caritat d' Olot (Gérone) offered yesterday a press conference to underline the caused injuries with l' institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Dilmé Villa, l' male nurse who killed at least eleven elderly for which it was responsible in l' interval qu' it worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Salted, s' is presented accompanied by l' lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that " the desire of Caritat would be that to be able to exert l' charge against the responsable" for deaths but " legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the processual situation of persons in charge civils."
And with share of the social discreditation that l' entity can suffer not to have detected in time the criminal activities of l' male nurse of night, the great threat for Caritat takes the form d' now; an important compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime goes back to l' August 2009 and qu' as from this day it n' did not cease killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence qu' it ordered l' exhumation of eight body - former patients of the gériatrique one - care it suspected qu' in much of case no doctor n' explored the deceased ones personally but, being given l' age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that " the lack of measurements can have been in no moment the cause of what s' is passé."
L' lawyer of Caritat added that " in this business there is only one index d' imprudence on behalf of n' import which other person that is not l' accusé."
The person already baptized like " l' Angel of Mort" acknowledged 11 assassinations day before yesterday and detailed qu' it committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and half later it killed one second grandmother.
In this case it caused death to him by injecting an sober-amount d' to him; insulin, with difference of the first crime qu' it had made with one mix of pastilles sedatives.
The director of Caritat mentioned the fact that c' is complicated to control l' access of the personnel of the center to medicines.
The injections d' insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used into six of the nine crimes that l' male nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the analyses of laboratory will clarify if Villa does not lie by saying qu' he sought for his first victims a death less cruel or by opposite he burned them with l' interior by giving them detergent as it already acknowledged qu' it made with the three women qu' it killed in l' interval 12 - October 17.
Caritat does not believe the declarations of l' male nurse of night, either the d' number; assassinations acknowledged, they n' do not eliminate the possibility of that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions that Vila gave in its visits to the County court and the lack of logic in the change in the manner of successfully killing after having made eight assassinations.
C' for that qu' is; they declare qu' they will remain at disposal of justice to clear up the range of the facts.
ECB threatens
The investors have reacts abruptly yesterday to the threat d' yesterday of Trichet who prevented that " the markets should not underestimate our capacity of réaction."
The differentials of the peripherals closed with the force and the actions of the banks Europeans underwent more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not either underestimate the capacity of ECB to be mistaken and l' euro hardly recorded an increment, which is a concerned signal.
What s' is typical d' is produced yesterday; a liquid market which same manner qu' it s' collapse, it is recovered, but moved by ends of short and very speculative positions.
L' institutional investor will be long in losing the fear.
One month ago, ECB quoted us aujourd' today to withdraw measurements of liquidity and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those which remain about it.
Bundesbank required the finalization of the d' plan; purchase of national debt because of its inefficiency and l' elimination of all extraordinary measurements of liquidity in the long term and leaving only access unlimited to the week.
After the Irish crisis let us hope for qu' one prolongs current measurements of liquidity " at least jusqu' with the mars" and maintains the auction quarterly with access unlimited to the end it quarter to guarantee the liquidity at least jusqu' in June.
We hope that l' one will continue with the program d' d' purchase; obligations and that l' even the signal of l' is given; to intensify.
S' they n' do not achieve the generated expectancies, they will reverse l' excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and s' they continue plugged to withdraw measurements of liquidity, that God helps us!
Just as during their meeting of May in which they affirmed qu' they n' had not even considered l' d' purchase; obligations and they collapsé the markets, l' history could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said qu' he had already bought much, by causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday l' bidding of drafts at one year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury emitted only 500 million to the 5,28% compared to 750 million to the 4,81% of l' bidding former.
Even thus, the types in Portugal lowered 30 basic points in all the curve, and clearly reflecting a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland one published the figures of the hole d' Allied and Bank off Ireland.
The figures estimative represent 10.000 short-term million and 15.000 potentials and they have a time jusqu' at February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland n' no credibility has after not having detected the problem in July with l' test of stress, the figures are assumables in the d' Plan; Assistance and help to reduce d' uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain l' parliamentary approval of its new budget and it n' does not have yet a sufficient support, consequently Ireland remains in a hearth d' uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to slacken the tension before next Sommet of the d' Chiefs; State and of Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a compromise political which shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same partition.
The problem is qu' Germany wishes to interpret Wagner and the remainder l' anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had l' opportunity of presenting yesterday the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and entities financial, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measurements to reactivate l' employment sound with hearing of the investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet effect and ZP explain the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange underwent the 4.5%, the double that the remainder of the European Stock Exchanges.
With difference in February, reaction of the Government and Bank d' Spain was fast and radical and we profit from l' effect surprised.
Aujourd' today there is a bidding-key d' an obligation at three years which will be profited by l' Trichet effect, consequently we hope that this one is solved with a strong demand and helps to dissipate the doubts about our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask a d' Plan; Assistance would be a car-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity of which us n' let us not need, the Treasury has more than 40.000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, with very expensive types and they cut l' access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of l' marry of César, " with share of l' to be, the paraître."
Courage, we can leave ourselves there!
The president d' Eulen will dispute the council of Vega Sicilia required by its sons
The storm does not cease in the conflict open in the centre of the family Álvarez, owners d' Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will dispute, because he considers it " no one of droit" , the legal adviser of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of its seven sons in which they will try to put forward their majority and s' to seize the bodies of management of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María Jose grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control d' a share of the group.
The founder of the larger holding of services d' businesses for the companies does not appear to be laid out to yield in its litigation to be present in managements of El Enebro.
Of its council d' administration it was excluded by five from its seven sons which appointed administrators in l' assembled shareholders of January 18 this year whose dispute is recorded with the Company and Trade register.
The legal adviser of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, again opened the box of thunders within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix l' assembly is, jusqu' so that the conflict is solved, the only mechanism which guaranteed the convocation of l' assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez like a " desperate recourse of the applicants its five sons to test, through a processual quibble, by defrauding the Law clearly and while misusing the right, to validate and correct l' assembly radically null on January 18 " , according to its official spokespersons.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once l' assembly takes place, is disputed by considering that this one is " null automatically ."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discrete silence, already tested without success which the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial and titular company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, inter alia credits, the wire of David Álvarez control the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services requests nevertheless l' usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This business is the basic problem that the judge must decide after l' goes down for hearing on the request for dispute for which it n' there does not have yet an announced date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon over Siemens
A software creates improvements on the cars at real-time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selects universe speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In a first moment, anybody n' held in account the options d' a new stable which came d' to arrive, in spite of the ascending trajectory of last the seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they bet all on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering l' skill as pilot of the champion, l' German Sebastien Vette, either the capacity of the Renault engine which propels its car, in the world of Formula 1 one speaks about the legend of l' " secret" arms; that the multinational company Siemens put at the hands of Red Bull to transform it in a team gaining.
It s' actually d' acts; a powerful software of simulation of process which the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far away from the automobilistic high-level competition.
Named PLM, this powerful data-processing instrument was used to create assembly lines of the factories fabricantes of everyone, stations d' energy, of the instruments of utmost precision.
L' objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or the process before building it d' a real manner, by thus avoiding the avoidable defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi or most famous the commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that l' use of this data-processing instrument in its factory of Formula 1 allowed Red Bull to create and carry out " in little d' hours, almost in time réel" , modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains why the stables of l' year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams which was able d' to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In l' equip with Red Bull work aujourd' today 180 young professionals of high qualification who, equipped with powerful data-processing equipment analyze and project any kind of modifications on the racing cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that software PLM is able d' to analyze and improve all the elements of the racing cars of Red Bull except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility for Renault.
One modifies the materials, the fuel, l' aerodynamics and members safety.
The changes can pass from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 12 midnight, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As single limitation of this madness of the technological improvement there is the amount of 40 million dollars which each team of Formula 1 can spend like limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull established l' machine high technology to create and produce its racing cars in a locality with 50 kilometers of London.
They are two buildings where the visits, especially for the journalists, are restricted.
All that occurs over there is considered " signal secret."
The personnel for this duty counts to 580 people, Ci-included two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The héro of Formula 1 of Red Bull, undoubtedly, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the energy drink mark has met with the service of its participation in the circuits, there is d' other hidden protagonists, of which l' activity is priceless and null notoriety.
The director of technology of l' machine, Steve Nevey, affirms qu' five years ago one could affirm that progress of R+D in the case of racing racing cars brought the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.
Aujourd' today these percentages changed and technology accounts for the 85% of success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added-value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by l' data processing, because " they are gladiators imprévisibles."
HP will install in the two Twenties clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its associate Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 trade between 80 and 100 square meters which the multinational envisages to install in Spain during the two next years.
The company will enter this initiative with the 16 zones already present in centers multimarque like PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave like example the altered store located on Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Reyes Bridge, with which that made 30 years qu' she collaborates.
The North-American group prepared a plan to establish 200 sales outlets of mark in Europe in 2013, strategy which includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The open first were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the past week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero n' did not want to reveal next the possible stores, even if she acknowledged that Madrid could be the following destination.
The director of HM personal systems ensured that philosophy for l' establishment of the stores will be always the same one, with l' support d' a local distributor with l' experiment and knowledge of the sector.
The North-American group advises and s' occupy of the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products which can be touched d' an interactive manner), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
Moreover, HP covers the staff training of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that c' is a system of frankness and stressed that the exclusive network of trade claims " to improve the service offered to the customers and to PMEs in l' purchase, l' assistance, the post-sale and even l' emballage."
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a program controls pioneer on world level which solves the possible problems of data-processing equipment of HP in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
" Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems which can often take even two jours."
" This system is conceived especially for MPEs and users, because the large companies contracted services d' already; assistance technique" , Helena Herrero noticed yesterday.
Sabadell bets on ' voler' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than d' other leaders, l' managing director of Bank value Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be one year hard for the banking environment, but initially rejects a new crisis of liquidity and predicted the end of the war of the liability.
In spite of that, it envisages a collapse of the margins of the interests, that l' one will try to compensate partially with increments of the commissions and price of the credit.
Sabadell wait to collect in three years a million particular customers, his task to be achieved.
Sabadell found a way to be exploited during the three future years and to be able to survive thus in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will start in 2011 a new master line which will hold one goes three years lability.
L' objective, with share to survive without need for resorting to the public allocations of FROB, is to gain a dimension of market by collecting d' a million new particular customers - 700.000 if l' one deduces those which can leave the bank, his great task to be achieved, because jusqu' now this bank had spoiled more PMEs and the companies that the particular customer.
This year it collected 250.000 particular customers and 50.000 companies.
Its dimension of market to the private individuals is of 3,5%, during qu' at the companies it exceeds the 10%.
Another base of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, d' austerity, with cost reduction like objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank lorsqu' it has the results of l' exercise.
Few banks now dare to lay down to make objectives and them public, because the financial crisis disturbed all the plans of the world banking environment.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its master line Optima, establishes it ya is four years old, even if initially the plan were for three years, but the market situation determined its prolongation for a exercise moreover.
The customers who let escape the cases d' savings will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be one year " difficult and transcendantale."
L' executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain " will be lente."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be " very difficult to create stations of travail" , which is fundamental for the survival of l' banking business, insisted it.
And even s' he thinks that the war of the liability - which penalizes the margins - is reduced, the price of the allowances for risk which the banks and cases pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity move already at the price of the credit to compensate for the fall of the margins.
" L' aspect of the liquidity and the financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the crédit."
" Us n' did not tighten the tap, but the differentials are more hauts" , Guardiola recognized.
Banesto already gave orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and to increase the price of the differentials - to see CincoDías of the 22 and November 27 -.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of the banking environment now " is d' to increase the commissions" , but " there is a framework compétitif."
The master line of Sabadell is based on the organic growth even if, like always, the n' group; do not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporative operations.
This n' is not in vain qu' it ensures qu' in Spain " larger dimensions." will be requested;
" All will move l' year prochaine" , it ensured.
He affirms that the needs for capital " increase énormément" and some Spanish financial entity could enter to the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can in the case of replace the market in the collecting of funds new recapitalisations.
After having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporal fence of the markets, it decreased l' importance owing to the fact that some banking predicts already like a new crisis of liquidity.
It announces that l' one cannot emit, but contrary to what s' passed in June, l' one can obtain short-term financing through rest, which attenuates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the d' possibility; one second wave of fusions among the cases
The managing director of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the d' possibility yesterday; a new wave of fusions of cases d' savings and insisted again on the speed with which s' carry out the reorganization of the sector.
When the lawsuit of concentration of the cases d' Spanish savings started, there were several entities which ensured qu' they n' were not going to take part in this first phase and qu' they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the managing director of the Spanish Confederation of Cases d' Savings (ECSC), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave d' operations.
" I think that most of fusions was carried out, one cannot say only l' incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is one second phase, they are ajustements."
" The majority were carried out completion; it is possible qu' instead of 17 one goes to 13 or 14, but all the great processes were carried out already under the supervision of the Bank d' Spain, which collaborated much in this operation aussi" , the leader underlined.
In the declarations during a breakfast of l' Association of the Leaders and Executive d' Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is carried out " with more possible high speed and we must be very satisfied with the manner qu' it is carried out within the deadlines qu' one fixed in the past, not now, in the d' plans; businesses with the Bank d' Espagne" , it emphatisé.
" The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28.500 million volume of the credits with 17 with 75.500 million is a lawsuit without equal in l' history, by reducing the number d' entities by 62% for qu' they are much larger to be in conformity with Bâle" , it underlined.
Olavarrieta recognized qu' " there is a series d' opinions rather not very happy on the slowness of the processus" who show " a lack of serosity and sens" , because " what the Bank d' Spain made is to point out qu' one must respect the time before the end of l' année."
The managing director of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, ensured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of any Europe and " probablement" world and it allotted to the people who question it a " miss connaissance."
The leader mentioned that being given l' current economic conjuncture, " we can remain very tranquilles" with the situation of the financial entities and cases d' savings, a system which began a process of concentration " very important" and " at the larger speed possible" goes;.
He also recalled that the Spanish banking environment s' in is quite drawn from the tests of stress that ECB realized in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in l' euro, but it has establishes the conditions for all l' Union.
The tensions of the markets caused a doble governmental answer.
D' a side, Jose Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods d' adjustment, which varies tax reductions for PMEs, regulation of the private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros d' helps with the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% d' AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of the 30% of the Lotteries of l' State.
D' another, the vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of l' former president Felipe González, s' links with criticisms of the chancelière Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How these should movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel n' is not an error in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, c' is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of l' euro.
And there l' Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which shocks with that to maintain the old traditions of the majority of its partners.
Vis-a-vis European resistances, in Germany l' one starts to speculate in the three possible exits of the crisis.
The first, one euro strong, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, inter alia country, and the south would give up the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if maintaining that seems science fiction, with a current d' very favorable opinion, close d' one 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of l' euro, on line with the German proposals for a greater macro-economic control, strict budgetary policy, fines with the countries which transgress them, of possible suspensions of payment d' a d' them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position clear and that is done a long time qu' it is defined, consequently now it n' there does not have place for excuses.
D' access, in 2009, when such an amount of the IMF as the European commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them as from 2016.
That was the first signal of divergence between this qu' Germany thought qu' one was to make (plane tax rigour and stability of public finances) and what its european partners, Ci-includes France, practised.
The second blow of the country center-European was when Merkel prolonged the decision with difficulty to save Greece.
As of this moment it made l' d' object; a wild criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and l' public opinion and published was against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end d' October, Merkel expresses a clear position again, while requiring reforms it treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue d' a country and to oblige at the same time with the private lenders to support a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted like anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the remainder.
But its proposal, well qu' a little edulcorated, was approved and, the months following, should attend to us the reform process of the Union which makes possible these measurements as from 2013.
Germany traced a red line qu' she does not think of crossing.
And she says to us with all that, even if now l' one must take measures with which l' one n' east can be not too d' agreement, starting from this date there l' old operation of l' euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth d' a new monetary area, in which the countries which transgress the rules will severely be sanctioned, they can be obliged with declared in suspension of payment and, in this case, the private sector will support also a party of the costs.
Germany announces us that we must follow a severe way of growth with high rates d' save and investment, moderation in consumption, of the improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and of trade balances positive.
An alternative based on the debt and construction, with enormous holes in the balance of payments, as that which chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be badly of not l' to hear.
It s' does not only act to renew the public deficit to the 3% in 2013.
This qu' one us request is much harder.
And this qu' it should not absolutely make in these circumstances is to mislead us ourselves.
J' hope that current turbulences let arrive towards us a larger peace.
And qu' one can seize l' opportunity qu' one gave us, jusqu' in spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero l' also heard this form and its double declaration (reform them promised after the meeting of last Saturday with the large companies and l' d' announces; yesterday new measurements) suggests that, in spite of criticisms of Merkel, one opened the way with the thesis qu' l' should be put; order at the house.
But the red line qu' Germany traced is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that l' one considers, one cannot exclude that d' to give up a monetary area too faggot of not very serious country.
And in this case, Germany us will be able to always say qu' she had informed us.
Sport and fraud of the law
Tricks similar to that d' Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show l' ingeniousness but not the will d' to escape a sanction.
L' expulsion warped in theory by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23 against Ajax in the League of the Champions made run d' much; ink on the character anti-sportsman of such behavior and if the two players should be sanctioned by l' UEFA.
As it is known, a few minutes before finishing the match (that their team already gained clearly), the two players deliberately wasted time lorsqu' they made faults to determine l' referee to show them the second yellow paperboard.
Thus, and considering Real Madrid will end up being a leader of its group, the two players will achieve the lawful sanction during the nearest match of the match of stopping against Auxerre and will be able to pass without paperboards to the next phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline d' UEFA sanctioned with two matches l' trainer of l' equip, Jose Mourinho and various economic sums with the implied players.
The provocation d' a yellow paperboard in circumstances like this one or similar n' is not a new practice, if not rather attends in the world of football.
It is so widespread qu' it makes party of l' ethos, of the rules not-written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate appeared in the reported case must with the fact that this had like protagonist a team of l' entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem posts the nobility and l' honor and which in last occasions condemned to a fine with its players for similar acts) and with orchestrated dramatization, seems it, by Mourinho, which adds an episode moreover to its dilated history of technician histrionic and provocative.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior not prohibited expressly by the payment contradicts the principles of the sport, c' be-with-to say, so with these actions l' a fraud of law is made; because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sporting payment, but seem to elude its direction.
The question is d' to examine the type of damage qu' they cause with l' sporting spirit.
One of the goods which includes/understands l' sporting spirit is l' physical integrity of the unfavourable players, an aspect qu' with these actions n' was not endangers, c' be-with-to say it n' there did not have violent play.
Another of these goods to which one refers with the correct play is to prevent that l' equip with the players offenders profits d' an unjust manner of l' equip contrary, which n' is not the case either.
However, the fact paradoxical of l' action of the players of Real Madrid is qu' it s' do not adapt so that l' one characterizes normally like cheating O defrauds law, because his violation of the rules n' was not realized seals some to test d' to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tested d' to be most obvious possible to receive the penalization of l' referee.
They waited and they accepted the sanction readily.
Another question is the d' type; favours that the offenders obtain examined disposed faults.
Here it seems necessary to note that l' one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and l' one n' an advantage in the same match obtains either, because obviously the result of l' action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with less players.
And this n' is not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously l' advantage consists in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the League of the Champions without paperboards which can threaten their participation in a future match.
But that is a long-term advantage, with a certain d' degree; indetermination, because l' team could be eliminated suddenly and besides that, with this action the players achieve a match of sanction and pass to the second cycle of paperboards, in which the suspension due to l' accumulation of the paperboards occurs with one of less qu' with the first cycle.
So that, to climb the levels, this n' is not so clear that is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary with l' sporting spirit, of which part nevertheless decision making forms strategic which supports the profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players n' did not actuate to avoid l' application of the sanction (that would be indeed a case clear of fraud of the law), m if not they rather chose the moment in which they were subjected to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty nor to flee that one.
Even if the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, in this occasion I think qu' there were a case clear of genius.
The polemic, seems to me it, appears because of two factors: because there were two car-expulsions and because of the manner of transmitting the director to cause them.
Evil caused with the principles of the sport by these actions n' is not ethical as much like esthetics.
Offensive of offered to collect the dinners of Christmas for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations financed by the employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives return also the dinner of groups before Christmas which continue to be the balloon d' oxygenate for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have to emerge in an offensive you prices adjusted to be able to collect with the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the men d' businesses and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete to complicate accountancy, the calendar of this year (as the night of the New Year's Eve fall Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, having like jusqu' result; now an avalanche of reservations of dinners for the days peak (17 and the 17) and almost nothing the former week.
Since 2008, which is l' origin of difficult times, it ya much of companies which eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, much d' employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
N' import which is the economic situation, they ask all of the prices of battle, confirms president de Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of employers', now, n' do not dare to predict how will be the festivals this month.
" People reflects much before réserver."
" They want to leave but they pay much d' attention with the prix" , it mentions.
L' business will be well " for those which give quality at handsome price and with a good service" , he adds, and recalls that the customers have the tendency to descend a level with the crisis, so that the section around the 25 euros became majority in the request.
In a survey in various establishments of the center one notes the collapse requests for the night of the 17.
The Soteras group indicates qu' there is an authentic boom of requests for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, which they answered by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.

The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons with " a rate/rhythm faster than n' matter that other pays."
Filtrations of Wikileaks confirm connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
Contents of the correspondence between l' American embassy of Pakistan and the Department of l' State of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks gate confirms enormous concerns which causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
With share lighting details and tasty qu' offer on the contents of the conversations and thoughts of the North-American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the co-operation between the two countries in the field of atomic safety, with the d' place; to increase, " décroît" and that l' unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons " at intervals faster than n' import which other country of the monde."
The characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case d' attacks - is one of the main reasons of concern in Washington.
C' is like l' ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, enumerates in a report/ratio before the visit of l' former adviser of National security, James Jones: " Proximity of certain nuclear installations of the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of the nuclear materials whose noise runs and vulnerability of the transport of materials atomiques."
The great number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the programs of missiles is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, like proliferating and a reason to maintain the guard.
" Pakistan has to engage of the personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; being given the fall of the educational and cultural levels, the organizations extremists have more d' opportunities to recruit people who works in the nuclear programs or of missiles" l' declared; expert Yuri Korolev, of the Ministry d' External Russian during a meeting with his American counterpart.
The new one of the documentation filtered by the gate of Julian Assange is the co-operation each time more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and l' raised Pakistani degree of production of armed nuclear.
A dispatch of l' Embassy in May, which qualifies like " frustrante" the communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: " The transparency is frequently non-existent; the d' offers; assistance remain unanswered or are éliminées."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of l' National intelligence for the south of l' Asia, notes that " in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces weapons nuclear power at intervals faster than n' import which other country of the monde."
L' Patterson ambassadress also asks Washington, during a visit of the chief of l' Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, qu' it makes include/understand " very clairement" with the person in charge that " l' Army of Pakistan must finish with l' tacit support with the groups terroristes."
With the hunting of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number with an high ranking official for the fight anti-terrorist to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol emits an Red Alert to follow the movements and to locate in Assange.
All related aspects with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emitted a " alarm rouge" for " to locate and follow the mouvements" d' Assange.
Nevertheless, it s' d' does not act; an order d' arrest traditional.
Moreover, this one n' is not new, if not it date of November 20.
And this one n' has nothing with even with last filtration moreover d' a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with the charges d' sexual abuse that l' Australian faces in Sweden.
Moreover, l' creative lawyer of Wikileaks, Stephens Mark, ensures that " the police force knows where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 body international police officer having the seat in Lyon (France) dictated l' order with request for Sweden, but it l' did not make public until yesterday, after having received l' authorization of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries d' Interpol received l' indication d' to identify or locate Assange " to obtain its provisional arrest and its extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give l' order d' arrest d' an affected individual by an Red Alert, much d' between the Member States, according to the explanations of l' organization, consider l' call red note a free track for l' arrest --that the national body of the police force must realize -, especially s' they have a bilateral agreement d' extradition, like c' is the case of Sweden and England, where l' qu' is thought; Assange is.
The movement made indignant with the lawyers d' Assange, which yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years, s' is shown laid out to answer by videoconference with the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They point out also qu' Assange requested and obtained the licence to leave Sweden of the prosecutor of its case, that l' one compares with famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of the safety of Stalin.
" That seems to be a hunting, not a persecution légale" , denounces the missive.
While the world seeks it - and in Australia his/her mother defends l' innocence of his/her son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but it is not keep silent.
Monday it granted as of an unspecified place an interview to the director of the Time review through Skype, a conversation in which it asked the resignation of the secretary of l' State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
" If l' one can show qu' it was responsible to have to give orders to the American graduates qu' they épient with l' UNO by violating the international treaties which the United States signed, it would owe démissionner" , says it has.
Its opinion was insulted yesterday by the secretary of press of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified like " ridiculous and absurde" the request for resignation.
" I am not at all sure why l' opinion d' a type with a Web page would owe us intéresser" , he for CNN declared.
Obama itself charged an high ranking official with the fight anti-terrorist, Rusell Through, d' to prevent new escapes of documents.
L' test of the spokesperson of president Barack Obama to reduce l' importance d' Assange contrasts with the opinions that the preserving politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who as from January will chair the Committee of National security in the Lower House requested from the Department l' State qu' he studies the d' possibility; to include Wikileaks in the list d' terrorist organizations " to confiscate its funds and to continue with any person who provides them contributions or assistance."
Still further Tom Flanagan, an adviser of Canadian president Stephen Harper went, which has to reconsider its declarations after having said qu' Assange will owe " to be assassiné."
" Obama should transform it into objective and use a plane without crew or something similaire."
A person who n' did not ask excuses was Mike Huckabee, minister Baptist, ex-governor d' Arkansas and possible candidate with the presidency.
" That which is in the Government which filtered information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be a punishment too aimable" , he for Fox declared.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with covering joints d' eye with the followers of Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret voting on his continuity.
Huguet proposes executive the plural and the end of the system d' assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to solve the énième revolt interns with l' interior d' ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious owing to the fact that his threat of resignation n' is not sufficient for the followers of l' former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time it knows that l' influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and than that cannot absolutely give him headaches qu' he had with d' other extinct currents.
C' is for that the leader of Esquerra will try to gain his new critics with covering joints d' eye which enable him to armour jusqu' with the municipal elections.
To start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers d' ERC will be able to come to a conclusion about its continuity in secrecy.
By ballot papers, not while raising the hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do it without any fear with the reprisals.
In fact, the chief of rows wants to avoid l' image of division and that of tender to its person.
In several interviews he affirmed qu' he would not be considered not ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, qu' a " result; with the bulgare" would not be good either.
The close people with Carod require with the president a little more than to place his position at the disposal of the militance, a gesture that not be worth when Puigcercós controls l' body maxim enters the congresses.
But because they do not lay out d' a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will test d' to approve with l' executive a roadmap jusqu' in May.
For that, they hope to take part in l' development of the strategic document of reorientation that the direction will subject to the voting of the national council the 18.
Its intention is d' to support Puigcercós in exchange of the promise of this one to program the congress for l' autumn of 2011, which the leaders regard as a sure fact.
The leader d' ERC acknowledged that the " polyphonie" affect the stability and that its objective is to make qu' once and for all l' organization is able to wash its linen room in family.
In this line, l' article that l' current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered l' ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder d' Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified " in exchange of various objectifs" c' is like if s' was made.
And it enumerated five of them, of which it underlines two.
The first, " recomposer" l' executive for qu' it accounts for at least 90% of the militance, c' be-with-to say, to include new figures which come from the sector follower of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes qu' Liquid ERC d' once and for all l' assembly like mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends one reforms statutes which allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by vote.
To finish with the model d' assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of l' equip with Puigcercós, which fought already in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 charged the direction with revising the model d' assembled in a specific congress of reforms statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of last the years did not recommend to tackle this subject.
Now, without critical sectors with l' mounting, the moment could be good to take it again and close it for always.

Obama promotes in Twitter the law with favour of the students without papers
" If you are d' agreement with l' approval of the Law Dream Act, calls keep silent senators and requires of them d' to approve this législation" , Twitté the US president in the popular social network has.
President Barack Obama s' east joins together aujourd' today with the national mobilization to support the Law Dream Act, to legalize the students without papers, with a message in its own account of the Twitter social network.
" If you are d' agreement with l' approval of the Law Dream Act, calls keep silent senators and requires of them d' to approve this législation" , Twitté Obama has.
Its short message maintains open a cybernetic bond with a fuller document which requires of the public to contact the senators immediately, because the vote with the legislation is imminent.
" With a vote that l' one hopes soon, now c' is the moment to listen to your voix" , it announces.
The message was revealed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if l' extension of the reductions of the taxes of l' time of Bush and the financing of the government is prolonged.
Such a blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and d' other projects like the ratification of new treaty START with Russia against the proliferation of the nuclear weapons.

But the partisans require 60 votes to approve l' initiative, reason for which they require the contest d' a great number of republicans, in moments when the organizations partisanes of the protagonists project an intense lobbying to guarantee l' approval of the Law.
The democrats, the majority whose supports Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless at least a d' they, the senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said qu' he would vote in against and only one republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
C' is for that the partisans of Dream Act require the vote of several republicans if d' other democrats decide to vote against l' initiative.
Between the most courted republicans there are the senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing senator George Lemieux, of Florida, which supplemented the mandate known senator Mel Martínez.
D' other republicans who supported in the past Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they declared qu' they n' did not go l' to support in another occasion.
Another republican who l' supported, John McCain, n' its posture jusqu' did not define; now.
Even if the Room of the Representatives has a different version, the analysts are d' agreement with the fact that the larger obstacles of Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literatures one puts the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which the participants made display of the narration
" Do the sex in the language, I include/understand it, but... the finger on the wound? qu' am ego hoped for? " , asked l' writer Luisa Valenzuela invited has to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle which celebrates the Spanish literature and who this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the roundtable was dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained it).
The finger on the plaie" ... puts to us in l' embarras" , l' launched gently; Argentina writer with the public, majority of the young people, who s' were joined together with the International exhibition of the Book of Guadalajara (WIRE) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which took part Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great history, with Luisa in first nobody as a protagonist who seeks knowledge which is the " plaie" , it goes d' a doctor with another, without obtaining an answer, only tracks in the same narrative wire.
Of l' infectiologist it leaves convinced: " patience n' is not my fort, it is perhaps my plaie."
At the end, after one frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut the breath in the middle of the corridor to him, but which explains to him why wound n' is not a scientific term; c' is the psychoanalyst whom the mystery reveals: " the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic system is the cicatrice."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: " on the wound j' only could know that c' is which is actually open and qu' it n' exist pas" , but convinced owing to the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very dependent between them.
Valenzuela, l' writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed one charming narration qu' he entitled Éloge with l' invention, where the finger on the wound n' is not numbered but at a given time is discovered.
With keys of magic realism, he speaks d' a famous enchantress who touched clouds, made turn over people who s' had gone far or repaired virtues qu' damoiselle had lost, a narration which l' transfers to speak then; America, the great news which had as of the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo which criticizes excesses of the narrations of the capitans conquerors.
" Cervantes which invented us all (writers) s' is made fun of the false witnesses which appeared in the stories presented like real, but d' a aitre manner one n' l' would ever have told; history of l' America with an imagination which missed even pudeur."
Nevertheless, it, " underlined; the insane ones and the liars have best the imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, one does not know any more which share of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its apogee.
One calls that in fact the ' tradition of Cervantes'.
" C' is thanks to its heritage that l' one is what l' one conte."
In its turn, l' writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the d' variety; interpretations caused by l' invitation of the WIRE with its roundtable owes It on the wound.
Cuban-Porto Rican has met it his on the large wound of social violence that its country crosses - and l' Latin America divides - produced arguments of adulterates and the sale of drugs.
" I think that the good literature, good poetry the good songs contain a tacit engagement that n' is not of course prémédité" , it indicated, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of l' engagement which s' establishes between l' author and readers, and that c' is a " reaction chimique" of this last.
The evening is finished with l' intervention of the Spanish poet Shine García Montero which also underlined " it must on the wound of l' writer engagé."
He considered that in a world which also lives out of high speed as for the intellectual practices and the control of the consciences which turns to l' favours dogmatisms, " behind each assertion there is small not and behind each negation there is small a oui."
" To be the Masters of our own feelings and to be the Masters of reality, we must moderate: and to moderate means much time to pose the finger on the wound and to disturb the people who feel very convenient while thinking in caricature, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and to also disturb with the capacities which prefer a world in white and noir" , says it has, while inviting to recover the direction d' to write.
Romano with the hunting of its first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales it had tops and bottoms in its career, but it knew to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there is in more two different styles which are confronted, marked by their technicians, who find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales, it had tops and bottoms in its career, but it knew to reach three times the decisive series, even if jusqu' now it n' did not put in the thousand and c' is for that this occasion is very special for him.
L' Argentinian ended up being comforted with the medal of under-champion, there remained a step behind gaining and curiously with the same team he played of the consecutive finales.
The strategist santist arrived at his first final in so much qu' trainer in the Tournament d' Opening 2002, lorsqu' it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later on, in the Fence 2003 it arrived also at the decisive duel and again lost with the total result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again against Diablos, Rubén a reverse suffered again, because its team made a match equal of 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties it obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of its players missed by 11 meters and it suffered the jump with the result from 4-3.

" I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, that is for a club, not for a passion that j' have and consequently j' will obtain the title, but what j' mentioned before is more important" , the quartermaster commented on when l' one asked him which would be its weak points in the finales.
He remembers much the last finale, of which he ensures qu' he learned much, " l' single lesson which we can retain c' is that jusqu' so that l' referee does not whistle the final one, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that is a lesson, before the end of the match l' fêter" cannot;.
It knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which l' do not worry, because he entrusts in his players: " One never seeks to arrive at the series of penalties, one tries to finish within the regular time, but sometimes it remains us only to prepare us, the former tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny made us a nasty trick, sometimes they are the emotions or l' distresses to hold the title between our hands, hands it has escaped us, that was useful to us like lesson for this final and we hope for qu' one n' arrive more in this situation-là."
Romano has l' now; occasion more not to be a one technician under-champion and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.

The clandestine migration will be able to continue without problem
The bill of the conservatives which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of the boats charged with clandestine migrants, obviously will be beaten whereas the three parties d' opposition announced Wednesday qu' they could not l' to support.
" I m' strongly support on Charte."
" I am held upright with a party which created the granite under your pieds" , declared the chief liberal Michael Ignatieff, then qu' it was surrounded by deputies after the behaviour of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals claim that the bill as suggested, which would make it possible to hold jusqu' at one year any person coming d' a ship identified like transporting clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of the rights and freedoms.
The chief of the Québécois Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated qu' he could not support the bill, parce qu' it s' in takes with the bad target.
" We are against and it seems that all the parties of l' opposition are against, then one will see what the government fera" , Mr. Duceppe declared.
Critic of the matter d' NPD; immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected reverse of the hand the critics wanting that its party is not firm enough concerning the clandestine immigrants.
" The néo-democrats are d' agreement for qu' one takes measures against the frontier runners the clandestine ones and c' is what we do by l' mediation d' another bill, C-35" , Mrs. Chow indicated.
" Us n' let us not support the bill of the conservatives parce qu' it s' in takes to the refugees and imprisons the children during at least a an" , explained Mrs. Chow.
The minister of l' Immigration, Jason Kenney, showed the parties d' opposition to play policy and d' to be unaware of the will of the Canadians.
" The Canadians say to the deputies qu' massively; they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations which target Canada and which treat the country like a paillasson."
" They s' wait until Canada takes fermes" measures; , reacted the Kenney minister.
The government n' a vote of confidence did not announce on its bill, which could have led the country to elections additional clause its rejection.

The new unit does not make l' unanimity
In spite of l' possible d' creation announces; a permanent unit to fight against corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, of many observers continue to require d' creation; a commission d' public survey on the subject.
The Minister for Public safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea does not date d' yesterday: Quebec would have consulted Department off Investigation of New York on this subject as of last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, l' announces Tuesday in has surprised more d' one.
It should be said that at the time d' a meeting of the permanent Council on the police services of Quebec, last on October 29, this n' measurement; forever discussed in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
It n' in was not necessary more so that the critic pequist as regards public safety, Stephan Bergeron, qualifies this advertisement of " rabbit left d' a chapeau" and of " solution arranged on the corner d' a table."
The Dutil minister as for him answered those which fear that the political power has too d' influence on possible the future unit.
" You will see the result when one goes l' to announce, is satisfied it d' affirmer."
" One is conscious of this problem-là."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Relative, nothing can replace the setting-up d' a public survey.
" More Mr. Charest s' is obstinated not to want to create this commission d' inquire, more people think like you and me qu' it has something with cacher" , he explains.
" The only d' means; to have a commission d' inquire, c' is the resignation of Jean Charest" , explains as for him Yves Boisvert, professor d' ethics and of governorship with l' National school d' public administration.
To leave this dead end, it thus suggests in Quebec giving a special mandate to the auditor general so qu' he inquires into the collusion and corruption.
" One must be able d' to widen the mandate of the inspector général" , it slices.
It also estimates that Quebec could give to the inspector the same capacities qu' with a police chief, thus allowing him d' to oblige people to testify.
D' creation; a permanent section n' is not the only project in the paperboards of the Charest government.
Quebec would also require of Ottawa to modify the criminal Code so d' to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would emanate from the prosecutor of l' marteau operation, which informed the minister of Jean-Marc Fournier Justice that jurisprudence n' is not explicit in this d' kind; investigations.
The federal minister for Public safety, Vic Toews, as for him confirmed that his/her colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, leans at present on certain amendments related to this file.
At the time of l' operation Printemps 2001, which struck the groups of motorcyclists, even if the criminal Code n' was not adapted, 131 people were stopped.
Ottawa thereafter made adopt the Law on the gangsterism.

She said that " they would be least choses" that the PQ s' excuse.
The formula of the consortia is a current practice in the whole world.
It s' usually d' acts; an alliance limited in the time which allows two or several companies to gather their respective expertises in order to answer a call d' offers for a complex project.
The Eastmain project comprises an high level of complexity taking into account l' extent of work.
The building site is in hand and owes s' to spread out jusqu' in 2012.
However, the contract was allotted without the play of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the formula of the consortia n' is more one exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As last week the Duty revealed it, the formula of the consortia in the sector of the genius-council made l' d' object; an investigation with the government.
A fast overflight of the register of the companies of Quebec makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, of which some seem permanent.
Thus, the Dessau firm works in partnership with the majority of its principal competitors, of which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Rock and Tecsult.
Each combination, and it there has tens, brings back of them to only one and even moral person, is Dessau.
As regards the consortium Energy management, the Normandeau minister stressed that " the territory of the James Bay answers the dynamic ones of hand-d' work particular and qu' Hydro-Quebec answers it in a particular way since the years 70."
The big boss of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Company d' energy of the Bay James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which made sourciller on the fact that the management agreement of the project was granted private.
" If you go in call d' offers and qu' there are few tenderers, your prices will be more élevés."
" You have two choices: maybe that you take people who are in this market and that you say: one will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good prix."
" But l' idea, c' is that this n' is not the price which is important, c' is the competence of the gens" , Mr. Laporte affirmed.
This contract granted to the consortium Énergie management forms d' part; a long list of contracts of more than 50.000 $ obtained by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-HAVE-Teal-Rupert project.
After checking, the Duty counted 109 contracts of genius-council granted between 2002 and March 2010 at firms or their subsidiary companies, in particular of the laboratories of grounds.
SNC-Lavalin has raid 22 contracts, Génivar obtained from it 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting its participation in Énergie management.
All the contracts were negotiated.
They add up 449.783.344 $, including the contract with Énergie management of 295.131.564 $.
Sylvain Simard made it clear that the four firms which compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are " well-known with the Liberal party of Québec."
The Normandeau minister dropped that the PQ is also related to these firms which it " financent" , before specifying qu' it s' acted rather of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - L' label " verte" n' do not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptic.
The Québécois consumer makes very little confidence with the actors of sustainable development, but also with the equitable marks and certifications écologisantes to guide his choices.
Worse, even s' it bathes in a media universe where messages in favour d' a more responsible consumption pullulate, it deplores a d' lack; credible information, deprives qu' it qualifies even brake upon its engagement, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even s' they made increase the socially responsible consumption of products said in 2010, the Inhabitants of Quebec seem however to grant very little credit to those which try to sell to them.
Two thirds d' between them indeed say not to believe l' environmental engagement of the companies just like the green publicity of the companies, reveals l' measuring instrument worked out by l' Observatory of consumption responsible for l' Sherbrooke university.
Another report: half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certifications affixed on the products known as equitable, but also of the credibility of the products and the marks s' posting as being écoresponsables, the Barometer indicates.
In the same vein, the speech of the politicians on this topic is taken with serious by only 14,6% of the Inhabitants of Quebec.
L' information as regards responsible consumption seems however paramount to stimulate this side of consumption currently animated by nearly one the third of the Québécois consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and doubtful character of l' information would calm the heats of 46% of the consumers.
C' is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Inhabitants of Quebec is also said being wary towards the pled performances of the products or green services qu' one seeks to put to them between the hands.
On another note, the consumers were about half in 2010 to have changed their practice and especially changed of mark d' one or more products to answer their conviction.
To a total value of 61%, they supported also purchases near tradesmen of their district and privileged l' product purchase food cultivated in their area, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and responsible - l' index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year -, l' Homo consumus of Quebec likes to be presented as the king of the recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental print in alarming of the protection of the animals.
But its social conscience and ecological seems however to remain with l' outside of its car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, hardly 28% of the Inhabitants of Quebec indicated to have used public transport or recommended the covoiturage to defend their green interests.
Walk and the bicycle were also supported by 39,1% of the participants in this vast behavioral investigation, which has just taken its first stereotype.
A loan of l' State for the repurchase d' eXcentris
The government from Quebec, of which one required s' to engage financially in the repurchase of the complex of cinema eXcentris by the Angus Company and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but with competition d' a loan only.
The Company of Angus development and the Parallel, which hoped for a gift of seven million dollars of the ministry for the Culture to repurchase in Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris on the St. Lawrence boulevard by giving again its full cinephilic vocation to him, n' do not obtain this qu' they claimed.
The government accepts s' to imply in the file, but in its own conditions.
Rather than the awaited gift, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be d' elsewhere lower than initial waitings, which could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least of l' opinion of the sources resulting from the dispensaries of l' State.
A d' foreground; action and a request for 12,8 million already had been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests for summer have re-examined with the fall.
A proposal and a d' plan; action were sent to the St-Pierre minister by the president of the Company of development of the cultural companies (SODEC), François Macerola, who controls the file d' eXcentris.
It forwarded to him an ultimate report/ratio there is ten days.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have jusqu' at December 31 to answer it.
It seems however that l' assumption of the gift of l' State must really be isolated.
Let us recall that l' Association of the owners of cinemas and cinéparcs of Quebec s' to an direct investment l' opposed; State to support the repurchase d' eXcentris, asserting that the ministry for the Culture n' does not have to finance real estate projects, this qu' it n' did not make for d' other cinemas.
But several speakers of the medium claimed on the contrary a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, master of the house, during ten years carried to end of arm the cinema d' author in his buildings of the complex after having financed itself its construction, which could justify an exemption on behalf of the Council of the treasure.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had known fidéliser its customers.
The Angus Company and the Parallel, with at their head Christian Yaccarini, control, on their side, a financing campaign with deprived, hoping to collect 700.000 $ to push with the wheel of l' acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, the Parallel, continues to diffuse films with eXcentris.
The goal of the future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms next on February 27 by projecting very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Of the men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini n' did not recall the Duty and one is unaware of what him and its group thinks of the proposals of the fall which are made to them.
The veil raised on complexed Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States regards as complexes it d' inferiority of the Canadians towards the Americans, but they betray at the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats s' astonish that each Canadian voter n' does not have the canado-American relations with l' spirit while going to vote and believe that the visit of president Obama helped the conservative government to make adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new communications between l' American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out over the public place yesterday, offer more crusty details that substantial contents to put itself under the tooth.
A dated September 22, 2008 cable, is in full federal electoral campaign, reports at which point the United States does not form part of the stakes discussed by the political leaders.
With the great astonishment of l' American ambassador in station in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
" A complex d' perhaps inferiority Canadian almost inherent conditions the Canadian political leaders with speaking d' interior stakes of the daily newspaper rather than to make carry this election on the United States (as at the time of the countryside on the free trade of 1988) " , he writes.
The United States is thus, concludes it, " the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening for in parler."
L' ambassador includes/understands d' as much less this " silence assourdissant" that the two countries have an intense political relation and economic.
" Logically, it, the capacity d' estimates; a candidate, d' a party and even more d' an head of party to manage this essential relation should be a key factor which the voters have with l' spirit while going voter."
L' another expression of this feeling d' importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, charged d' businesses in Ottawa, preparing president Barack Obama with his first visit in Ottawa.
" Your voyage will help to ensure the survival of the government at the time of the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more d' one decade because d' a revival program from 30 to 40 billion dollars" , writing Mr. Breese.
Nowhere n' it is made mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid d' to be reversed by the coalition and that the parties d' opposition made its survival conditional to the quality of the revival program suggested.
Another communication, gone back to January 2008 and signed l' Wilkins ambassador, warns Washington of l' increasingly negative image that the diffused drama series with CBC return from the United States.
L' ambassador s' anxious of the emissions To border, Little Mosque one the Meadow, Intelligence and H2O, in which one observes not very subtle references to Maher Arar, with the " No-Fly-List" or with removals for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that, at the time of their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if l' Europe was ready to accomodate certain prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of " individually ."
At the end of the meeting, he is written, " he gave a paper to the secretary d' State by the way d' Omar Khadr, Moslem a 15 year old d' origin canadienne."
" The secretary agreed to re-examine the dossier."
Let us note finally that the s' spirits; overheat concerning the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen To grip, declared on the waves of CBC that the person in charge of this massive escape should be " assassiné."
It s' l' is made; echo of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A world plan to renovate l' lighting
L' UNO proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan of restoration of l' domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries for d' to obtain a gas reduction with greenhouse effect (GES) which corresponds almost to the third of the additional reduction qu' it is necessary to realize to stabilize the planetary climate d' here 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the tread of the concrete great projects that l' UNO hopes to make adopt in Cancún to compensate for l' d' absence; constraining engagements of reduction by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan deposited yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs which still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs fluocompactes or, better, by bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (LED or " LED" in English), l' main part of the 1,8 billion tons (WP) GES emitted on planet to light the human ones would be avoided.
L' lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
C' is l' equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet.
With Copenhagen, l' last year, large transmitting countries, like the United States, China, l' Europe and d' others, of which Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans which should make pass the total emissions of GES of 53 WP to 49 WP.
But it will be necessary to withdraw of this assessment still 5 WP to manage to stabilize d' here the 2020 rise of the climate to 2 centigrade degrees so d' to avoid qu' it does not become out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of l' energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the remainder, that is to say 5%, produced light.
With bulbs fluocompactes, the expenditure d' energy is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs with LED, one reduces this d' need; energy of twice still.
The bulbs fluocompactes last on average from 6000 to 10.000 hours.
New bulbs with LED, as those which launched the Philips manufacturer this week - this company has d' elsewhere taken part in l' study of l' UNO -, have a 25.000 hours life expectancy and consume 80% less d' energy qu' an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of l' possible economy with a plan of replacement which s' would apply to 100 countries.
These very new bulbs can also function with rheostats in more d' to emit very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists posted reserves with l' place of the bulbs fluocompactes puisqu' they contain mercury and qu' they should be eliminated like dangerous waste, which n' is not always possible in the developing countries, except if the manufacturers set up instructions.
But, the report/ratio, the d' independent source indicates; mercury emission on the planet n' is not l' bulb fluocompacte, but rather the thermo plants with coal, which emit much mercury to produce l' electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States only, these power stations emit 25.000 tons of mercury per year.
The report/ratio details the profits which each country thanks to this international program would make.
For example, l' Indonesia would thus save a billion dollar per annum in d' purchases; electricity and eight million tons of CO2, are l' equivalent of 3,5 thermo plants of which construction would cost him 2,5 billion.
The Coast d' Ivory waits in the nervousness l' announces electoral results
The general secretary of l' UNO, Ban Ki-moon, claimed the " publication; without délai" results of l' presidential election in Coast d' Ivory, after l' expiry of the fixed periods.
" The general secretary underlines the need for the independent electoral commission d' to complete its work and d' to announce the provisional results without more time, underlined a spokesperson of the chief of l' ONU."
" He asks all the parts of the Ivory Coast and the institutions to make proof of responsibility and of s' to abstain from any initiative jusqu' with l' announces provisoires." results;
In spite of the pressures exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission let pass the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the poll of Sunday.
Approximately forty minutes before l' expiry of the period, the president of the CEI had affirmed on television that the commission " travailler" continued; to announce the results.
The calls multiplied Wednesday in the world so that the CEI proclaims finally the name of the winner of the second turn between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and l' opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on l' cancellation by the Constitutional council of votes " frauduleux" in the north, held by l' ex-rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the blow d' State lacked September 2002.
Pascal Affi N' Guessan, campaign director of the president of the Ivory Coast, affirmed that the operations d' intimidation of the voters practised by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the partisans from the outgoing president d' to go to vote.
All l' election could be cancelled if the lodged complaints by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional council.
However the adversaries of Gbagbo estimate that the high court of the country n' is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N' DRE, a political allied close relation of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North which contradicts any bond with the ex-rebels, judged " inacceptable" delay in l' announces results and requested from Gbagbo them to respect, but it n' jusqu' did not go; to assert the victory.
Its allies affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results parce qu' it knows qu' it lost and that to carry felt sorry for before the Constitutional council, after having prevented the electoral commission from distributing the results, would be illegal.
The second tower of presidential, Sunday, were supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation d' a country remained divided into two during years.
The United Nations informed Wednesday the political community of the Ivory Coast qu' it could be held responsible d' possible violences.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the head first turn, on October 31, with 38% of the voices compared with 32% with Alassane Ouattara, which received the official support of l' former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% with the first turn).

Alexandre Guérini put in examination and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years, leader d' undertaken treatment of waste and brother of president PS of the general advice of the Rhone delta, was put in examination and écroué at the house d' stop of Luynes, close d' Aix-en-Provence within the framework d' an investigation into government contracts supposed fraudulent.
Alexandre Guérini was put in examination for abuse of corporate asset, embezzlement and public goods, concealment, active corruption, traffic d' influence and detention of ammunition, indicates its lawyer.
" Alexandre Guérini is combative and holds with s' to explain on all the questions which the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasmes."
" It is easy to continue it for a multitude of reprehensible chiefs, it is other thing of the prouver" , had declared with l' AFP its lawyer, Florence Rault, before l' hearing of its customer.
Mr. Guérini, brother of l' strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, by l' intermediary of its lawyers, to make pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to s' to explain.

Business Clotilde Reiss: l' Elysium exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, fate of Clotilde Reiss, the French enquiring young person decree in Iran for " espionnage" , l' held; opinion in breath in France, put the diplomacy in alarm, and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
The whole under the attentive glance of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain lower parts of this crisis.
They describe how l' Elysium explained its strategy with the Americans, going jusqu' to give them councils for the treatment of their own crises d' " otages" in Iran (an small group of hikers).
They show how the French persons in charge sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman n' as a counterpart had not had the handing-over in freedom of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and sought by American justice for material traffic for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Lastly, they place under a raw light the way in which the French presidency sought to handle the media to accredit l' idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it n' in was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris east entitled " Iran: French comments on the way of managing cases d' otages."
The adviser of l' Elysium for the strategic businesses, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quay d' Orsay for l' Middle East and North Africa, Patrice Paoli, s' maintain with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise with the Americans d' in making as much to repatriate their own nationals selected of force in Iran.
" Made bruit" , they, " say; hammer " unceasingly; in the media the words " rights of l' man fondamentaux" , " innocence" , " release immédiate."
One needs it so d' to embarrass the Iranian mode, sensitive to its image.
" Make it d' as much more than the Iranians requires not faire" of you;.
Because, last attempts at discussions by discrete channels, " silence will not regulate rien" , the Iranians are " Masters in operations dilatoires."
Mr. Richier adds that l' arrest d' foreigners is " a familiar Iranian tactic: the catch d' hostages for the blackmail politique."
He announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will intervene on August 16, day when she takes refuge with l' embassy of France) " the payment with the Iranians d' will require; a broad amount d' argent" (230 000 euros of guarantee).
And it states that l' Elysium anticipates d' other crises d' hostages, a phenomenon which " s' goes; aggraver."
The Iranians could " in the near future to stop another of some 1.800 French citizens alive in Iran" , he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been coming out of prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: l' Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims l' extradition for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic material towards l' Iran, is given in freedom to Paris, on decision d' a judge.
L' American embassy, like many observers, s' question on this disconcerting coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the Iranian clandestine networks d' acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, l' widening of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a bargaining?
Release of l' Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman?
At the time d' a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier ensures that this n' is not the case.
L' Elysium, says it, has not only " summer completely taken by surprised by the decision of the juge" , but sought with s' to oppose to it.
" There were sharp exchanges between the French presidency and keeps it sceaux" (with l' time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but " the French government cannot return on the décision" legal, it observes.
Mr. Richier wants to as show as Majid Kakavand remains placed under l' " étroite" monitoring of the French intelligence services.
The adviser of l' Elysium composes a phone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that l' Iranian " is currently localised in buildings in Paris managed by l' embassy iranienne."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, l' Elysium does not spare its efforts, by means of official statements and of " fuites" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a " part; important" and " influent" of " médiateur."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that handling bears its fruits since several press articles reflect the French official version.
A dated August 25, 2009 telegram evokes " the ' blitz' media of official the français."
On what so many " is based; gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, wonders l' embassy in Paris.
" In spite of their declarations full with praises, official French recognizes into private qu' they n' have qu' a vague concept of what the Syrians have really fait."
The document leans then on the reasons which pushed l' Elysium to be poured in this fiction.
L' intense effort of communication " aim at validating the policy of Sarkozy d' opening to Syrie" , it analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which " had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and with l' foreigner, like premature and imméritée."
In " exaggerating the syrien" role; , Paris seeks with " to show in Syria which praises it can s' to attract by playing a constructive part in the région."
L' objective is also of " to sow seeds of discord enters Syria and l' Iran."
L' American embassy knows it good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted to him: " of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything. "
" But thanked we them nevertheless. "
" That should at least sow confusion at Iraniens."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it with l' Elysium.
In an official statement, he thanks the presidents for Brazil, of Senegal, and Syria, for their " active role in favour of the release of our compatriote."
No online games for the young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law known as " of Cendrillon" who will prohibit the teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated governmental leaders.
A bill will be submitted to the Parliament in December to ask for the companies online games of block l' access to these plays after midnight, to the young ages of less than 16 years, indicated representatives of the ministries for the culture and the family.
" Much d' children play these plays all the night and have then difficulties in study with l' school and to have a normal life during the journée."
" We estimate that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to dormir" , declared with l' AFP OJ Rin, the ministerial person in charge in load of the bill.
The online games will be again accessible at 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will be one year old to prepare with l' application of the law, it specified.
The government also plans to ask the companies to limit time d' daily access to these plays for the young people whose parents make the request of it, added the person in charge.
It also will place at the disposal of people who claim it free software which makes it possible to limit the time spent on Internet.
South Korea is l' one of the countries more " connectés" and the newspapers regularly bring back various facts related to a d' intensive use; Internet.
The country is also the uncontested champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had gained four medals d' however in World Cyber Ranges, vis-a-vis 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: the FIFA indicates the organizing countries
In full storm because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the FIFA indicates Thursday the organizing countries of the World cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the fights d' influence and the lobbying are likely to take the step on the technical criteria.
A thing is sure, l' edition 2018 of the competition queen of the FIFA will take place in Europe, bastion traditional of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Country-Low-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities belonging to the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Shine Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, l' emir of Qatar, the heads of government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic issues and political d' world.
The negociations in slides are thus likely to last jusqu' at the last minute.
For the remainder, difficult d' to establish a hierarchy enters the candidates.
According to the d' report/ratio; evaluation of the FIFA, the English files, hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee with l' hour of the vote.
Sunday Times, with l' origin of the revelations having led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of its country, cradle of the football which n' accomodated World the qu' only once, in 1966.
The BBC gave from there a layer, Monday, by diffusing documentary which pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to dissatisfy the FIFA and to put in l' embarrassment the English persons in charge, who launched out in an intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron in first line.
The chief of the government hopes to republish the blow successful by his Tony Blair predecessor, who had obtained in 2005 for London l' organization of the JO-2012.
This intense activity will be enough it to regild the blazon of l' England at the EC?
Nothing n' is less sure because the duet Spain-Portugal does not miss d' assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its culture foot.
But the dark economic and financial outlooks for the two countries could doucher their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of l' Spain and of Portugal do not make qu' to increase the dimension of Russia, become an outsider of weight in spite of the gaps of its file (stages, hotels, transport).
But the Vladimir Poutine Prime Minister decided not to carry out displacement in Zurich and denounced a " unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" , in an allusion hardly buckled to the charges of the British press against the members of the EC.
" They are covered mud, one tests of the compromettre" , Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, forts of l' experiment of 1994, seem the logical favourites.
First world economic power, seat of the principal sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to have a length d' advances on Japan and South Korea, which built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidatures appear premature for two countries Co-having organized l' test in 2002.
Another threat: l' granting of World-2026 in China, ardently wished by the FIFA, which would make in fact null and void the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which left the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and l' Australia, the FIFA would continue its expansion towards new regions, but these two countries present more risks than of certainty.
L' Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the rights TV discharged (because of the jet lag) by the European countries, Money for the FIFA.
Second mandate: l' obviousness
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made believe qu' he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac n' did not have the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less qu' them.
A mandate with l' Elysium calls another of them.
Thus l' current chief of l' State will be candidate in 2012.
But l' obviousness does not make good household with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then it should be made as if the doubt always existed.
In a direction as in l' other.
In 2006, even without believing in it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed qu' a third mandate n' was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured qu' he would make his decision " some share with l' autumn of l' year 2011."
Qu' it evokes in front of members of Parliament UMP, Tuesday evening with l' Elysium, the prospect for " two mandats" thus a little febrility sowed.
This was l' official announcement of its candidature?
One was far.
The president did nothing but recall that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year periods.
It made a report, not an advertisement.
This n' is not the first time qu' it evokes the presidential one, on the tone of l' humour, at the time of such meetings.
" In the worst case, or at best, you still have some for seven years and half with moi" , it had launched to them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: " Do not believe only I do not think of l' stage d' après."
Its remarks d' day before yesterday do not return it more candidate that the day before; they do not return it less.
S' they cause comments, c' is for a double reason.
L' acceleration of the race to the candidature for the PS, d' a share.
But that n' is not l' entry on the lists of Ségolène Royal who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to be revealed.
C' is on the contrary because its candidature in 2012 is obvious that much with the PS claims a setting in battle order earlier than envisaged.
Bad surveys, d' another share.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidature of Francois Fillon for that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L' Express train).
" We have a candidate and it n' there does not have discussion with l' UMP là-dessus" , immediately and prudently l' reacted; entourage of the Prime Minister.
" S' he believes the possible defeat, he will not be candidat" , Jean-Pierre Raffarin entrusts.
" He will always believe to be able gagner" , Alain Juppe corrects, resigned to l' obviousness.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of titles d' State
The last meeting of the Council of the governors of the European Central bank (ECB) of l' year was to be l' occasion to specify the methods of way out of crisis or, at least, d' to announce l' stop d' a good number of the nonconventional operations of monetary policy which owe s' to complete at the end of l' year.
Crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, l' institute d' emission of Frankfurt will not be able to undoubtedly allow d' to be also peremptory under sorrow d' to worsen a situation than tended more aujourd' today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be d' as much higher.
Yesterday, with l' occasion d' a press conference, the Minister for Finance Frenchwoman, Christine Lagarde, thus greeted the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the crisis of the national debts in Europe.
It n' did not wish to say if it estimated that the central bank was to make more, by increasing for example its program d' d' purchase; sovereign obligations.
" I reserve my reflexion with my european partners (...) ."
Day before, in Brussels, during its hearing by the commission of the Economic affairs and monetary of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, s' is not shown more eloquent as for its intentions, being satisfied d' to indicate that the program d' purchase of titles d' State on the resale market " poursuivait" and that " we will see what us déciderons" during the meeting of this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its unchanged directing principal rate with 1%, its low historical level since May 2009.
In the facts, the d' purchases; Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, with nearly 1,35 billion d' euros.
And, according to the indiscretions d' operators of market, it would have carried out new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday.
On the whole, central banks of l' eurosystème bought for 67 billion d' euros since May 2010.
Among the operators of market, anticipations d' a continuation of the purchases are not any doubt (see page 29).
Economists either n' do not await notable change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months already disappeared from l' arsenal of the ECB, the latter still carries out unlimited allowances of liquidities according to generous conditions and for s' durations; spreading out one week in three months.
The economists s' await aujourd' today so that this device is prolonged of a few months.
" I cannot m' to imagine qu' it modifies in an important way sound programme."
" If not it would be to take the risk to cause new short-term tensions " , estimates Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
" A progressive exit announced during the first quarter 2011 appears more probable" , anticipates on its side Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the plan of its interventions on the market of the national debt, " the ECB should maintain a d' volume; purchase of these obligations to animate a market atone" , Norbert Bräms adds.
Taking into account l' importance of the exposures of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the euro area, l' institute d' emission n' d' does not have; other choices to maintain its presence on the market.
" It is necessary for him at all costs to replace the d' lack; investors on the market and to act of such kind to prevent a racing of the outputs paid by the States more fragiles" , an important bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if the rates d' interest s' fly away, the States will be d' as much more constrained to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
Safeguard of l' euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After a worrying beginning of the week for l' Italy, the situation s' is slackened a little, yesterday, with the backward flow of the bond rates at 10 years.
A return to a state of calm precarious.
With leaving d' a meeting with the minister of l' Economy, the presidents of area said to have intended Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation d' " indéchiffrable" and s' to wait one weekend " imprévisible" , which l' interested then contradicted.
Tuesday in any case, l' variation with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) s' was flown away at 263 points, involving a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out qu' in Spain, l' variation with the German rates was higher than 400 basic points.
But its right-hand man, Gianni Letta, s' " is declared; strongly préoccupé" by " turbulences of the marchés" and by a possible contagion in source d' Ireland.
" The good news is that l' Italy, third economy of the euro area, n' is not like Greece or l' Irlande."
" The bad news is qu' it is like Portugal" , explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in Hudson Institute.
In light, its problem is l' absence of growth and l' lifelessness of the tax re-entries which goes with, making run to l' State the risk to more be able to meet its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth from now on is awaited 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012... whereas the budget in progress d' examination with the Senate counts on respectively 1,3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculates the European commission, the public deficit will account for 4,3% more of the GDP l' next year (against 3,9% envisaged by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
D' where the rumour d' new supplementaru estimates which could be set up after the festivals, for an amount of 7 billion d' euros.
" If necessary, of new d' measurements; austerity will owe beings prises" , estimates the police chief with the economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For l' hour, l' Italy receives the support of the international institutions.
" The fundamental ones of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time " , ensures Arrigo Sadun, l' Italian administrator at the Bottoms international currency in load of l' Italy in the IMF.
" It n' there does not have problem in l' immediate, neither on the court nor on the long run, because in spite of its important debt (119,2% of the GDP in 2011, note), the efforts of stabilization requested from l' Italy are less than those requested from d' others pays" , observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of l' OECD.
Remain the question of l' political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure with the House of Commons, following what of the anticipated elections could be organized at the end of March.
S' a period not very favourable with decision making in the event of serious crisis would open then.
Europeans think of the reinforcement of the anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde l' still hammered yesterday within the framework d' a press conference in Paris: " Europeans, I believe qu' one l' still Sunday in the course of the day showed and in the night, obviously interdependent, are determined, engaged to defend their currency and their zone monétaire."
Although quite relative, relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of the obligations d' State European brought l' water with the mill of the governments and the ECB.
But one cannot speak d' yet; a beginning of standardization.
L' standard credit rating agency & Poor' S.A. announced qu' it could degrade the note of the debt of Portugal, the target most concerned aujourd' today by the speculation.
" As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and of political visibility, which weighs in particular on the systems bancaires" , the economists d' estimate; Exane BNP Paribas.
D' as much more than " political time is much slower than the time of the marchés."
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers qu' it conceals, the European countries intensify the discussions to reinforce the already existing anti-crisis devices.
The abstract consultations between the Ministers for Finance most directly concerned and, more largely, their par of G20 go good progress.
And this altough for the meetings of l' Eurogroupe and of l' Ecofin of the beginning of the next week.
The ECB meets aujourd' today.
With the menu, fate of nonconventional measurements of support for the countries of the euro area in the collimator of the markets (see above).
As for the Funds European of financial stability (FESF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a turn d' Asia to inform the investors natives of the Far East of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If l' objective of these visits n' is not rising of the funds, it prepares of it certainly the ground.
The first emissions of titles of the FESF are envisaged the next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted to l' Reuters arranges whom the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct engagement of the IMF.
The countries which are in first line, Portugal and l' Spain, as for them, s' prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular out of matter d' organization of the job market.
Reforms which s' add to d' measurements; austerity for purpose more brought closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a way different from those of Greece and l' Ireland.
L' one and l' other make a point at all costs of avoiding requiring an international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrective measures and deciding essential structural reforms to give again confidence durably.
European backers, finally, s' maintain on the options available to accelerate the process of standardization of the sovereign bond markets.
Of passage to Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber had the first advanced l' idea that if the 750 billion d' euros mobilized by l' Europe and the Funds international currency n' were not sufficient, l' Union n' would not hesitate to give the hand to the wallet.
The economists of Capital Barclays, an actor of very first plan of the market of the European sovereign debt, judge qu' a extension d' approximately 100 billion d' euros would be enough, " preferably " in the form d' direct injection of liquidities.
The vehicle exists: c' is the equipped European Mechanism of financial stabilization, to date, of 60 billion d' euros.
A council which has all the chances d' to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially if the conditions of market worsened.
Snows and glaze: 24 departments in orange alert
The snow-covered episodes still generate traffic jams, in particular on the district distributors in Brittany, and are likely to disturb certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are from now on in orange alert because of the risk of snow and glaze.
L' The Eure, l' Eure-et-Loir, Two-Sevres and Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange alert, 18 for Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, constant snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and Charentes and it snows slightly on l' Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow going from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are awaited for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even jusqu' to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d' Armor, Finistere, the Gironde, the Dordogne, of Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie areas, Ile-de-France and the Limousin.
The snow-covered episodes are sufficiently notable to generate traffic jams and to disturb certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Coasts d' Armor, several secondary roads were prohibited with the heavy lorries of more than 7,5 tons, of which the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Circulation on the district distributors in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend not to travel by his vehicle qu' in the event of need and the circulation of unquestionable bus FOR THE THIRD TIME was suspended for the day.
School transport was prohibited for Thursday in Picardy.
No n' specific measure; Wednesday evening was considered to restrict the circulation of the heavy lorries.
The prefecture " invite all the motorists with the more greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their control consequently ."
Head office of l' civil aviation (DGAC) required of the airline companies d' to cancel Thursday 25% their flights on l' Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because them snowfalls to come.
The DGAC recommends to the air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, l' airport of Gatwick, in the south of London, and that d' Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed jusqu' at Thursday morning.
Subway Large Paris: first financial drafts
Since time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France beats full sound, the billion rains.
In the discussion at least.
One evokes in particular 23 billion for the subway Grand Paris which the Company of Large Paris must build.
To start this SGP, l' State announced an equipment in capital of 4 billion d' euros.
In the theoretical diagram, c' is this sum which will allow the SGP d' then; to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Aujourd' today, one arrives finally at the first additions.
The corrected finance law 2010, examined in committee of supply of l' National Assembly this morning, contains the devices designed to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: d' creation; a special tax d' equipment and increase in the tax on the desks in Ile-de-France.
The first, reads one in the text of the bill, article 15, is " with the profit of l' company public corporation of Large Paris."
It is quantified: " The product of this tax is of 117 d' million; euros per annum ."
The second is a refitting d' a tax on the desks which exists already " in order to it modernize, d' in increasing the product and d' to assign this increase to the Company of Large Paris."
Would that pay how much?
Mystery.
This n' is not quantified in the text.
One is far from the 4 billion.
" It is specified that these tax resources s' add to the 4 billion d' euros of the equipment in capital which will be mobilized by l' State and brought to the Company of Large Paris progressively of the projet" , can one read in l' exposed reasons.
With the SGP, one does not find this system shocking.
" From the moment when one created receipts (two taxes, note), one can cover the studies over three years then to type in the 4 billion afterwards, explains one. " there;
" It will be registered in the budget and will progressively be drawn ."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which the 4 promised billion is still to the absent subscribers, is likely to cause a a little agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Hackers avengers and spies in diligence
L' WikiLeaks business has a double value.
D' a side, it appears an apparent scandal, a scandal which n' seems scandal that in front of l' hypocrisy which governs the relationship between the States, the citizens and the press.
Of l' other, it announces deep changes with the international level, and precedes a future dominated by the regression.
But let us proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, c' is the confirmation owing to the fact that each file consisted a secret service (of some nation that it is) is made up exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
" extraordinaires" American revelations on the sexual practices of Berlusconi do nothing but pay what since months could be read in n' import which newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi is owner), and the profile sinisterly caricatural of Khadafi was for a long time for the artists of cabaret matter to sketch.
The rule according to which the secret files should be made up only of already known news is essential with the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go in a bookshop devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-the-Castle, Templiers or the Rosicrucian brotherhood) exactly what was already written in the former works.
And this not only because l' author of occult texts n' do not like to make new research (nor does not know where to seek news on l' non-existent), but because those which are dedicated to l' occultism do not believe qu' with this qu' they know already, and which reconfirms this qu' they had already learned.
C' is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Idem for the secret files.
L' advisor is lazy, and lazy (or d' spirit limited) the chief of the secret services (if not it could be, which I know, writer with Libération), which retains like truth only this qu' he recognizes.
Information secret signal on Berlusconi that l' American embassy of Rome sent to the Department d' State were the same ones as those which Newsweek published the week d' front.
Then why the revelations on these files did do such an amount of noise?
D' a side, they say what any cultivated person knows already, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second world war, and since the d' chiefs; States can be telephoned or to take a plane to meet with dining, lost their diplomatic function and, except some small exercises of representation, transformed themselves into centers d' espionage.
N' import which spectator of films d' investigation knows that very well, and this n' is that by hypocrisy that l' pretence of l' is made; to be unaware of.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly viol the duty d' hypocrisy, and is used to place under a bad light the American diplomacy.
In the second place, l' idea qu' an unspecified hacker can collect the most secret secrecies of the most powerful country of the world carries a considerable blow to the prestige of the department d' State.
Also the scandal does not put it as well in crisis the victims as the " bourreaux."
But let us come to major nature of what arrived.
Formerly, at time d' Orwell, one could conceive all to be able as Big Brother which controlled each gesture of its subjects.
Prophecy orwellienne s' was completely proven since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction carried out, l' visited hotel, l' motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of l' eye of the capacity.
But when l' one shows, as that arrives now, than even the crypts of the secrecies of the capacity cannot escape control d' a hacker, the report/ratio of control ceases d' to be one-way and becomes circular.
The capacity controls each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - elected official like avenger of the citizen -, can know all the secrecies of the capacity.
How a capacity which n' more the possibility of preserving its own secrecies can it has hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, qu' a true secrecy is an empty secrecy (and empty secrecy could never be revealed); it is true, as, as any knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secrecy of secrecy, because concerning the public domain; but to reveal, like l' made WikiLeaks, that the secrecies of Hillary Clinton were empty secrecies means to remove any capacity to him.
WikiLeaks n' made any wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but in made too large in Clinton and Obama.
Which will be the consequences of this wound inflicted with a very powerful capacity?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not be able to put on line any reserved information any more - that would come down publishing it on a poster stuck to the corner of the street.
But it is quite as obvious qu' with current technologies, it is vain d' to hope to be able to maintain the confidential relationships by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a d' chief; State s' is moved in the plane and contacted l' one of his/her colleagues.
How could the private and reserved reports/ratios be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for l' moment, my forecast concerns the science fiction and is thus romantic, but I am obliged d' to imagine government officials which move in a discrete way in diligences with the unverifiable routes, in n' being carrying that by heart learned messages or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel d' a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copy in drawers closed at key: at the bottom, the attempt d' espionage of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
J' had l' occasion d' to write that technology advances now out of crab, c' be-with-to say to let us move back.
One century after the telegraph without wire revolutionized the communications, Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephone).
The video-cassettes (analogical) had allowed the researchers in cinema d' to explore a film step by step, while going ahead and behind and by discovering some all the secrecies of the assembly, whereas maintaining CD (numerical) only allow to jump of chapter in chapter, c' be-with-to say by macroportions.
With the trains at high speed, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, then qu' in plane, and qu' displacements; it includes, it takes three hours and half.
It n' is thus not extraordinary that the policy and the techniques of communications return from there to the horse-drawn carriages.
A last observation.
Formerly, the press tried to include/understand what was woven in the secrecy of the embassies.
Now, in fact the embassies require the confidential informations of the press.
Climate: how France do-it-yourselfing its promises of financings
One year after l' Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time d' to examine the respect of the promises of financings quickly resolved (known as financings fast start or early) carried out by the developed countries.
And the large French bidouillages is revealed.
In l' agreement of Copenhagen, the developed countries were committed providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
L' European Union promised 7,2 billion d' euros over three years and France 1,26 billion d' euros (either 420 million per annum).
At the time of l' opening of the COP16, l' EU left the big game to persuade her partners of reality her engagement concerning the financings fast start: report/ratio detailing l' action of its Member States, press conference, large side vent, distribution of booklets...
L' operation transparency appreciable and is appreciated with its right value: the developing countries and the civil society would like that all the developed countries make in the same way with the same level of precision.
L' EU announces to have released in 2010 2,2 billion d' euros, which puts it on the good way for the respect of its engagement of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when l' one looks in detail, the things are more complicated.
This money must be, d' after l' agreement of Copenhagen, " new and additionnel" , so d' to ensure qu' an extra effort is carried out without being with the detriment of l' Government aid with the development.
Unfortunately, it n' do not exist d' agreement on what " means; new and additionnel."
Whereas the European commission had proposed a harmonization, certain Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Aujourd' today, each one chooses the reference which is appropriate to him best.
The European commission for example regarded as reference l' year 2009: the international financings are maintained, and she adds 150 million to it over three years under the financings fast start.
D' other countries chose similar references in d' terms; year or in terms of level d' government aid with the development.
With l' opposed, France estimates that the financings of " all new the projets" of l' year 2010 are " new and additionnels."
In other words, it n' there does not have reference to the expenditure of the previous years or the total level d' Government aid with the development.
Concretely, the entire amount of the support of France for the developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its engagement as regards financings " new and additionnels" ...
Another crucial factor, the distribution between gifts and loans.
There still, it n' do not exist rule and each one chooses its way of calculating.
Some, France, consider qu' 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, that is not easily justifiable: l' effort n' is not comparable.
If l' use of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects related to l' attenuation of the emissions which rest on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present one euro that l' one will recover like equivalent with one euro that l' one gives... At most, under its engagements only the cost of the loan for the country lender (either l' should be counted; d' equivalent; a rate d' interest).
But France n' has that to make d' such a reasoning: it " respecte" its engagement of 420 d' million; euros by making 91,5% of loans (389,8 d' million; euros) and 8,5% of gifts (36,1 d' million; euros) - to see the document of l' EU to check by yourself.
It is the only country of l' Union to use the loan so massively.
L' Germany requires there to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) respect their engagements with 100% of gifts.
In other words, when very large majority of l' European Union puts 1€ to satisfy its engagement, France puts only 10 centimes and considers that l' effort is comparable.
Pretty juggling act!
In short, in its financing fast start, France operates a double swindle: d' a share on l' evolution of l' action in time and d' another share on the reality of l' financial effort.
While spending only 36,1 d' million; euros, it manages to make believe qu' she spends about it 420 " million; new and additionnels" in coherence with its promises.
The handling of the ministry for Finances (because it seems well that c' is Bercy which carried out l' arbitration) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within l' EU (why the other Member States would continue to give s' it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely easily deceived...
The chapter of the early financings n' is qu' a small question, of relative short term, compared to l' together discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand moreover in l' immense machine qu' is l' UNFCCC.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
What qu' it is, it is essential to learn the lessons from this first year of early financings.
All d' access, France could announce a change in its mode of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its engagements and d' equity with the other countries of l' European Union.
But especially, France could advance the discussions on the stakes of long-term financings (another crucial chapter currently discussed): one n' will not escape the question from " l' additionalité" or of the mode of accounting of the loans.
France could change its position to become also progressist on these stakes qu' it l' is on d' others.
L' hope thus rests on new the minister of l' Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancun the next week.
An advertisement surprised on the fast start of France and its vision of " l' additionalité" and l' use of loans would be natural to increase the degree of international confidence necessary to advance in the discussions.
Alarm with the pesticides introduced by the children
A 10 year old child introduces in one day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday of l' association Future generations (ex- Movement for the rights and the respect of the future generations).
L' association, which prevents that its " results; n' do not have significant statistics taking into consideration low d' number; analyzed samples, but are illustrative problems traitée" , bought between July and September the food generally consumed in four meals and a encas in one day by a child d' ten d' years, in the supermarkets of l' Oise and of Paris.
These standard meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1,5 liter d' water per day - as well as delicacies, were examined by laboratories in the search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of l' plate is overpowering: 81 chemical substances of which 42 are classified carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified carcinogenic some like 37 likely substances d' to act like disturbers endocriniens (EP), according to studies of several institutions the such international research Center on cancer.
" Even if, in almost the whole of the cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, one sees well in our investigation that the reality of l' exposure of the consumers to the possibly carcinogenic contaminants and/or EP is préoccupante" , note l' association.
