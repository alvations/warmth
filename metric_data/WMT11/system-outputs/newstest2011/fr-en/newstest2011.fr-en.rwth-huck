That is what will happen? Cssd is or Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new www.cities-localgovernments.org. CSSD at the capital's mayoralty will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily actualne.cz has "tested" new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argôt born during the recent years at the town hall, when it was the current coalition partners who ran in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the cream policy of Prague has initiated during the era of the previous mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand very well the terms.
At least, they say.
"That is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a jeunôt in the political pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to culture the vocabulary of the" godfather ."
And with regard to the veteran politician, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "hole golf."
"This is the only expression of those that you are suggesting that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
The vocabulary, whose daily aktualne.cz published expressions in June of this year before Congress this pré-éĺectoral of the ODS, strategy-drafting has chosen 6 examples, primarily those connected with the mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the biggest hole golf in Prague," go to the patisserie ,"" sinews of beef, "" betrayal of the capital "and" entôler ."
Three of Parliament-elect were in favour of the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, which must lead education in Prague in the future - has promised to begin a maintenance but then has not won the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has refused the test.
"I am not at all of these things lá and how fun representatives of democracy citizen: I do not give my opinion."
"I am currently of how we are going to understand in the context of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky did not recognise apparently in the legend above, it is the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing á' Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest hole golf in Prague."
"It is the tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and adds: "But I know newspapers."
"I'm going to pay a language courses," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Plachy Lukas, the elected for the environment, know that the hole of golf is the tunnel Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the person - he thinks within the meaning of "go to the pastry."
"It is, I think, to go in a," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that it draws its knowledge rather newspapers and not any vocabulary that it would use.
According to the tests there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we have not really something of this kind."
"We are saying the names sometimes use of abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, that the Party members call Hulda.
"I called Briza to school but I don't know if my colleagues call me as, 'avoue Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the Party, is nicknamed "the small toy."
The nicknames are also the only admit that use within the party, the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky do not really hear Hulda, but the daily akutel.cz has been another nickname for this president Prague.
"Doctor with a" reportedly recalls appeared Petr Hulinsky has obtained a doctorate in law judr. à police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women reported witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, for example, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated and not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely this fate."
"I do not young women in good health because they are in the work and give birth of children," says a sister who deals in the capital of the West African countries, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this "social measure" unusual.
He has published a brochure which should help to limit the witch hunt.
The case involves a "sting."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the daily Die Standard about the disadvantage of education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72 -year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they threw him.
It is the server of the BBC, which has sent this information.
The criminals say that it was the reason.
According to their version oil that is used to onctions ritual has emflammée on contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, apparently when the team wanted to "dispel the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a contractor of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "the eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, Gambia not later than last year has even seen the President himself participate.
"The President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch-hunt which apparently had been involved in his death and would be tried by the black magic to kill also President."
"The shamans of Guinea near came to the rescue, have led to the presidential Kanilai, under the protection of police and the presidential guard of the President, men and women selected at random into villages of Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
The firm has the prisoners had to drink a herbal potion to hallucinogenic effects that cause other effects on the kidneys and the gut.
Two prisoners do not have survived.
On the international pressure that is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: the poèles light, he signed a higher rent.
A man VVO came through the door of the centre of society GARs Byty "baron coal" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
It was under his arm a dossier with three new leases for three apartments: his, that of his daughter and his son who is currently spent.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to resolve from next year for an apartment 2 + 1 second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son who has signing authority.
"But I signed," he explains to motié angry and half resigned.
The civic association apartments Byty okd.cz who described the nouelles understood as "immoral and obscene," advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, which will be published a notice to explain the method for demand.
But NHRCK reacts with a gesture of the hand.
"One said this, the other said something else" as they frowned eyebrows.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, that is what awaits most of the apartment in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason aktualne.cz has decided to visit the "laboratory."
The waiting room of GARs in the street Havirovska is one of four of the region of Ostrava and it is already full on Tuesday at 09 noon.
Beside the door is a guard of a security company with a device for clients.
A special button, "rent 2011," is on the screen processes tactile.
One pressure and a paper with a lot of the apparatus.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your starts already beginning to brighten up on the big screen in the topit waiting room.
In a split second it is your turn.
After a short time, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rent do not appear to affect people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to resolve common problems as everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance and other events.
In the region of Ostrava, people of more than 44000 apartments portfolio of GARs receive the letters with the new lease contracts in their mailbox to letters since approximately mid-November.
Byty GARs their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special system for the new rent is open to the public since November 18.
"It works for almost a week, so that is still in the" responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client is as journalist.
The déragulation and old apartments of minors are a Bakal local very sensitive.
The Vice-President of Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek Social Democrats indicated fairly sustained before the elections and it now local newspapers.
"20 Years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even have not changed... A failed to work in the wc, is in the introduction NHRCK mentioned.
However, it is, according to the employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new rent if they sign up now as promised GARs in a special offer.
This is a cut of half the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires who have signed a new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska is really not burdened by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," says the box office.
And yet GARs porpose both on its website that in the showcases individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties disagree on the rent is an independent tribunal which will take the decision.
'It is not about threats but only to inform on the unique and legitimate to act legally, "said GARs on its website.
"Nobody will go to the court" believe one of the of GARs Byty and the man in the street in the centre of clientele gives him reason.
"I SEK 13000 and SEK 5000 to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media request that no sign and therefore the people expect," said.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to GARs Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rent does not always reach the level necessary for the maintenance of the fund for housing," Pavel Klimes, director of the portfolio of residential society GARs Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 GPB with rents could invest in the apartments, 4 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen on the ceiling in front of the chairs around the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, repeat some information indicated in red.
The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of the apartments of GARs. "
"And this will always be 7.50 CZK the square meters per month," said the screen.
The increase of 38 percent applies only 400 apartments portfolio of GARs.
"In these cases, there is an increase of a very low amount CZK 19.66 square meters," adds GARs.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
Byty GARs promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase but gradual on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of increase rents (see the graphe) into the apartments in the form of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent.
The nursery school is part, too, offices have understood the architects.
The administration building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of society Arch. Design.
No one would have expected that it is also a mini nursery school with all that is needed - walls of colours, furniture, toys and finally a playground miniature on the terrace.
Since October last year, can visit the children of employees of arch. Design.
Society of projets-architectonique Arch. Design. Whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined his mini nursery school business since the first drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of children and it is important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time that employment contracts in time decreased, nursery school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by society Arch. Design. As part of its social program.
The builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work taking with the care for children.
Employees of arch. Design. Eux-mêmes who have imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain a contribution of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded by the of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the allocation of funding (2.8 mil.de CZK). They were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure a qualified staff as well as the implementation.
After the use of the allocation of funding (two years) society Arch. Design. Has the obligation after 3 years of the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is society Economy rating that has helped to make the request.
The child care is provided by a qualified staff, all day a nurse and a teacher of maternal care for children. A children can go to school without age limit but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there are only 5 children at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the position of authority.
Although it is agise of care and education, the programme of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children are not only play but a quality education is also assured - from beginning to school teaches English.
The class is equipped not only of toys and games imaginative but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can at any time controlling their child and not having the stress of a delay to the children in a school from the workplace of parents.
Parents use their time of the most productive.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch. Design. S' is thus enshrined among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program makes HR.
The house in bone fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look in the internal to talk.
The toît looks like the back of a saurien prehistoric, the staircase to a backbone of dinosaur and balconies to hangovers fish open.
This is the house Casa Battlo to Barcelona architect Antoni talk.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname house.
Organic forms, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, recalling the scales and everywhere curves, that is all that is ypique for Art Nouveau of Antoni talk.
The facade of the house frontal held its dream, its colours and textures pleasant that recall the nature and animals.
At a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the pace and the next thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and went in such a way that the impression of brillance color.
The enroulement and violence "forms also in the domestic with the same measure.
Timber copy in waves executives of windows, the balustrades, decorative elements of, the oeilleton and slats.
The house Battlo which exists in the neighborhood Eixample in the street market Passeig of Gracia at. 43, was born of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction is for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of a proper talk of an unusual and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as house multiple was not thought by proper talk alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project led decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the façade also worked for other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo began with an and succeeding cooperation between Jujol.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of proper Casa Mila and park Guell in which there are other works to talk.
The local have dubbed the house to hot just after his finishing because of its organic forms "house in bone."
Other, given the specific mechanism of opening windows have called "the house that drink."
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George's boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain religious motives hidden.
Proper thought for the house a single system in its time of central heating, with évents aeration and chimney typical.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the creation proper talk has not respected the directives of construction and has not been hampered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he received from the city the building permits, of course, knowing that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after finishing the city council was horrified and changes.
He did not like, for example, the local council as the pillars of the construction empiettent on the public.
There was never change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Battlo Josep Battlo (and got satisfaction) permission to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common lounge and a third chamber and a private party of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery.
The full house of six floors is shared by a staircase by which access to a terrace of toît independent.
All angles rights and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by walls.
Proper talk also worked the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or be confined space for private talks more intimate.
The house with the reconstruction of proper talk has received addition of new facades a toîture non-traditional and two floors.
The game of proper talk with the light is also impressive, glass tiles blue and white with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the wells of lights.
The game in two colours gives a maximum of light in all the floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the White reflête more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Battlo which has been included in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage UNESCO perhaps visited by each.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious apartment and the most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 on the 150 th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they found that it is a lucrative business and they have broadened the scope of visits to the common spaces and the attic including terraces of toît.
The entry ticket in the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, the groups and card holders tourist has a 20% discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into other constructions of proper talk in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its tourelles fantastic, you have to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: women have other criteria than men.
Not ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the surface at bedtime, the mattress and the sommier give a real basis for a good read.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please an user concrete.
For the choice several things are crucial: the weight, size, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The type of which will place the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the house of campaign where sleeps not continually the mattresses in gum are not appropriate because they "hot" slowly.
They have, moreover, a weight greater than the standard polyurethane foam standards.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough channels of breakdown in and, in addition, they on a plate, they retain moisture. The mould can also form.
The habit is also crucial in the choice.
Anyone who the clear time abroad where they frequently mattresses very thick with a layer rammollissante, will feel hard on a surface low and hard.
"This is how all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there."
"For their shoulders tired, the feet and the coast, they needed mattress with a layer of foam rammollisante lazy."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system who are evil" information "of joints and skin," Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in the furniture padding.
That is why a few years ago the mattresses with foam lazy has conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to see a foam lazy.
This "miracle" works.
She optimisation its rigidity and his form in the heat absorbed or adapts to the warmth of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you do not go back into the night as after a difficult match.
You sleep better.
The foam lazy also functions as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman in a size of 180 cm a bed of 210 / 220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm to 180 cm.
For the beds in one place, the singles, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in the case of visit.
However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on their backs you should ask the hands comfortably together with slightly complied. Prokopova Helena, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who indulges for several years to the issue of a healthy sleep and ergonomics non-furniture taught in the schools.
For a bed to two seats each needs its own sommier and mattresses, however, attention during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will increase the sommier at different heights and this is not feasible on all managers.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattress springs to at least 15 cm, of this matter to the layer of form and aeration at least three centimetres.
"The infructueuses or in a sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of sommier.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and the sommier are united as sisters siamoises, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress aèrent very badly; Nations-Specific the wash, which is commonly auhourd' today.
And since it is normally during the night of 0.2 to 0.75 the sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress starts to recall a great (and clogged) sieve.
For this specialists refuse to make the KOSC on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a guaranteed for life.
But to his but.
And a board of experience on the part of sellers: for a mattress of 120 / 140 cm, dispensing, for the surface of the mattress, hygiene or the brainwashing but add a mattress of protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and wash.
And even if it is common to manufacture surfaces with closure to glissière for all, that is to say that after the opening two parties (for the brainwashing and the size of the washing machine that is very important!) Or manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when cut off a fight between a light weight and a lorry on a ring.
You have in your bed a drawing rigid instead of a sommier?
Never!
The maximum for a bed visitors for a single night.
However équipez done (if there are none) of aeration holes and use the mattress to life with a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in sachets (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of aeration.
A mattress in polyurethane should not be part of a bed of this type.
For the mattress frame to slats to unique position with 14 / 18 slats, the mattresses in gum or so-called sandwiches served (perhaps a combination of gum and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress to several positions should not be mattress springs to because it does not meet the position changes.
In the regulation of the rigidity of slats can also install as a cradle.
It is a special link of slats which forces even tipping the lamelle for the shoulder of the dormeur "fits."
For men who have "the broadest shoulders," it is really important.
This thing is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses for the "male" began to use a zone rammollissante at the level of the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer a more soft surface at the level of the hips.
E-Customer the more difficult it is to frame wings or platelets with what is called a suspension multiforce.
The pressure contaminate in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and increased air) on good mattresses and sommier, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a pillow simple: the pillow must support the head and its peaks must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders could rest.
The recommended size is 50 cm X60 that Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When one is lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade (with the cradle of the sommier or the rammollie area in the mattress) the shoulders.
The modern mattresses still have something in common with the first made from straw and herbs.
The manufacturers still use natural substances or mixtures.
The trend is also organic mattress.
The raw materials pétrôle, from which it produces the polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all manufacturers use known precisely soybeans.
"The bio for the mattress means that the heart is manufactured using natural products," said Petr vasicek society Tropico Plus.
The natural materials are used for the coatings mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules developers of the forest or lavande.
There are differences between the man and woman.
While the excerpt of birch to the surface of the mattress absorbs heat and cooling the body, "cooling," "light" women.
The excerpt from poivre red accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
The mattress made from foam cold (she has more oozed with a cellular disrupted more respirante than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foam mattresses polyzones who know exactly where the head, the lower back and the feet.
You will pay a mattress of quality from 7000 Nkr235 and more.
Those who are characterised by their parameters for health have less VAT and are used as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Economiser for the mattress and the sommier is not simple.
We may from time to time in the framework of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Such as society Magniflex which proposes mattresses Duofreeze with foam to memory memory out for 11990 Skr.
Obviously you can take the second charge.
The era of foam lazy or viscoélastiques with a cellular structure open and a large thickness was started with the matter Tempur at a pace "cosmic."
It started as a subject for NASA parceque astronauts were the start of load factors.
The Tempur is rammollit heat and is strengthening, on the contrary, the cold.
It is therefore perfectly suited to the human body and distributes pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil and slept for an increase of comfort during sleep.
The viscoélastiques is used not only for the mattress but also for products for health, such as the special pillows for the feet that relieves the legs and the system veineux.
The Czech manufacturers use for example, foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver or the.
The devices to follow people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child brings more and more people to think about the monitor with a GPS.
The system, put in the early to seek cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases by exmple as that of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a clock.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to confuse their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not spying but only one way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr Pilin society MAcro Weil which is one of the suppliers of tracing the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are clients who buy the product for security reasons," Pilin.
He said children should always know what is used "the container" and how to use in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention if the child does not want to focus on something of this kind, it débarassera.
'And even the smallest can be a great creativity when it comes to get rid of express something when they do not want to be under control ."
"Mobile phones, which can be cut as these devices tracing, have already led parents to lengthy expectations," says Bockova.
She said, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is an abduction prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device that can locate him."
"It is now the phone."
"As soon as will develop devices tracing, they (criminals) will also because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She acknowledged that such devices can help during an attack not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech society RC Monitoring, which offers services tracing both for cars and people, says that to have this kind of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The apparatus can be paramétré in such a way that it is in regular issuance after a specified period."
"In the case where the aircraft is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The appliances more expensive also have an inclinomètre that immediately reported the position of the person who has slipped and is in a recumbent position without taking any action, "said Cech.
He said the so-called smart phones that are fitted with a navigation system, can offer comparable service after formaté with a prologiciel special.
The problem of tracing current is that it is a device similar to those paid in pendentif the size of a matchbox box to the smaller telephone.
We can always lose.
According to Pilina society Macro Weil, that is why the tests are being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognize the apparatus of tracing."
"Or it will report after a certain time, which would have given the police a little more time," he said.
When the tracing is developed in the form of bracelet or pendentif, it utilisiera always the same technology to make cars.
It is a combination of systems of acquiring a position via GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a cell phone alert the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many cordeaux détonants that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with. But it can take two years.
The army has bought 445 km of cordeaux used for explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of cordeaux is two to four years.
The army has bought cordeaux détonants to the company STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The General Staff has because of the achât a huge amount of cordeaux détonants to Mf Dnes that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of reserve to hold the pyrotechniciens army, that Mf Dnes contacted, that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or the household should have an annual exercise explosives each year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of cordeaux détonants.
Has this distance is 25 000 explosions.
And even if this were true, the reserves of the army could provide for 10 years.
If it is true that for the entrainement basic of each new professionals it enough to more than 2 m cordeaux détonants, as the experts, this means that the army with its new purchase degree-giving - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for 225 years.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention recently complained to the Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that the shooting are limited because of the money needs.
On the lack of underwear do not talk.
"And I don't take the lead they buy us a large quantity of cordeaux détonants."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"For us the army is a good that we are trying as traders to please," said the director of STV Group Decky Jan.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, arguing the achât hundreds of kilometres of cordeaux détonants by the fact that the army will these "ammunition" for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group mdcme.ca however only four years of life of cordeaux détonants and pyrotechniciens of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are stored in deposits, it may even go up to four years," said one who does not want his name to the criticism of the army.
The time of past, each item must be tested to see if it remains integrates and does not threaten the life of a soldier.
These tests are not free and cost money.
The department's argument is a rebate due to the amount for 445 km of cordeux détonants.
"They have cost 60 percent less than the provision of last year of 245 km," said the spokesman Pejsek which is the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of cordeaux détonants of pyrotechniciens police which neutralize the munitions from the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police command always only the quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their working life.
It has been established for reasons of security of pyrotechniciens and to obtain more flexible types of cordeaux détonants more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence has major problems for the elimination of tens of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the army Czechoslovak strong of two hundred thousand men was preparing to travel, on the Rhine.
The store in a few years this Czech army that Mf Dnes contacted: neutralise hundreds of kilometres of old cordeaux détonants it buys today "cheap."
So today I gained from my contacts in the competition.
The sale of its hotel under franchise has helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the competition for the best individual Contractor.
The winner of the competition for the best individual contractor for the past year has been Pytloun Lukas, contractor for 28 years.
His adventure to the succeeding is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, he realized that to Libérec it lacked a site accommodation quality at a reasonable price.
His savings on what he had won when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in trosième year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
It was the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the benefit in the building he transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his FoodFirst entrepreneur has allowed him to open up to 4 Libérec pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it came another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we have sold our concept of frankness and other candidates for the -horoughnessof hotels Pytloun have demonstrated," the 1 number of entrepreneurs in the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the implementation of a hotel large-scale victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served," Pytloun with recognition.
The victory gave her more than popularity and be known to Libérec and its environs.
"People recognize me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible.
He said that he uses until today its contacts and knowledge that he would not get another way.
"With those whom I met through competition I started to trade regularly.
According to him, the renowned linked to succeeding has also had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I see among them especially loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been in general."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the objective of winning Farmet has the worst moments away.
Those who got the price Slovansky dum for the first of the competition for the Firme year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The board has rewarded the efforts he has transformed a workshop tools to Ceska Skalice in a firm turnover of 100 million kroner.
I can say that the reward has encouraged not only myself and my staff and has increased our self-confidence to combat competition, "said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he has not hesitated long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a society with a few comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of baignoires plastic.
Not long after they have begun to specialise in the presses for vegetable oil.
Eighteen years after it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has been known even in the public not GFCCI after succeeding obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to really get the mark Farmet but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were working with a company that has received the largest succeeding in his country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year urisdiction has not gone to Farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made from economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery engineering.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"We have not escaped this situation."
"The figures fell 40 percent, and we dûmes limit our production and even sack," said Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time we need to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation correctly and have retained results bénéficiares even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, they continued to Farmet without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with appropriations a training centre and research, have strengthened the presentation of society in salons-expositions international and won the main prizes in the national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires date back and with them the number of employees also.
"The new democracy--more I wish this pleasant buzz of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes reglèments crazy.
The investigation into the Absurdité of the year is for the fourth time a part of the clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The winner of this year of the investigation into the Absurdité year was the obligation to provide in the offices of documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, the administrations of the Social Affairs asked an extract from the trade register while can get in two mouse clicks.
Change, thanks to the investigation.
"The administration Czech social insurance takes more the excerpt from the trade register for checks on payments of insurance," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the administration Czech social insurance (CSSZ).
Bring out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the clan affairs organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters identified themselves, it is at least 4000 this year who have made their voices.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations which the company, and this, more and more.
"We are perhaps the number of documents for the tax returns ahead of the game in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a stated aim of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is in 74 th place with regard to the conditions for the company, 8 seats compared to last year.
The competition of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
It is that each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, the last time before the close of the competition.
To report there are the website www.firmaroku.cz. Next, the organiser of the competition chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdité who received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is a hundred or more exactly 105 regulations and décrêts who have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the finalists' "of the competition, among the nominees is for example, the requirement that vehicle maintenance motorways and express lanes pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the site of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an into which regularly figures from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises from the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'The economic prosperity cannot function when the state âtons floats in the legs of entrepreneurs and for my goal is to remove, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company, "said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove décrêts absurd is not an empty gesture.
In 2007, which did not like people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the company at the location of the company, intend to go to an exhibition or a power with a booth.
This requirement was removed with the ammendement of the Act on the individual company.
The second obligation most popular in 2007, which was to report to the Bureau of Labor a trip for a foreign employee on 30 days, has been removed with the text of the so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdité of the year 2009 was the décrêt for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their offices, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by order of the Department of Health the year dernière-l' obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards firms socially responsible.

The novelty of this year's contest Hospodarske Noviny, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the Firme Officer of the year 2010.
The onjectif competition is the support for the company reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator Vodafone, the firm, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For the first year of this subcategory of the competition of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, registered companies that have not of succeeding with a long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of ideas and an independent would be to publish.
Although the subject of their company is different from one another can be seen their support and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
In one of the cases, this is about people with disabilities and personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the Czech Republic is not example society of pro pragoise And Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of employees who then participate in number of tournaments in different sporting disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of Pardubice is society Isolit-Bravo who is 17 years since the main contributor to the endowment funds which sponsors disabled children.
The caring for employees with health problems, there are still the old factory paper Podebrad which employs more than 70 percent, and for this, was awarded the title of the firm Officer for the region of Central Bohemia and placed third in the region of the Firme year organized by Vodafone.
In, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for having introduced more flexible working hours and even decreased to 35 hours per week on average, and this, without, proportionellement, loss of wages.
The board déverné title because it achête priority manufacturers Czech, supports a ditoyenne activity in the near abroad and is concerned about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible for our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the Executive Director of the company.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also think about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages work at home and use the services of a local factory catering protected for its actions.
"We also support the Foundation the man in the shadows that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy the representative of society.
At the very last, also for its activities, a society of Lavage and cleaning of the region of Karlovy Vary, who participates in the retirement of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, the increase of qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction of bruntal Czasch, winner of the region.
Would automatically enrolled in the class society Officer, all regional finalists for the assistance of the Firme year of Vodafone, which had responded to the questionnaires attached document for registration and had returned to the organiser before 15 August.
The answers complaintnt met or incomplete in the questionnaire were withdrawn by the organiser of the competition.
"If the representatives of the firms had not responded to questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Officer but were not disqualified the" principal "the Firme year of Vodafone."
"The independent are not possible because it is a subcategory of the competition of the Firme of the year," said Karel Goldman agency organising Bison & Rose.
The Fund for the lands to Plzen, police made the arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Fund for the lands to Plzen, the anti-corruption police made the arrests in recent days.
The detectives have spent the handcuffs to the local contractor and trader in real estate Lubos g..
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the ground proposed by a candidate.
It had to pay to Lubos g. Half a million kroner.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are still a person for insider trading in the framework of a tender and a concour policies." Said to the newspaper Pravo the Chief Prosecutor of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more details because the investigation is ongoing.
The police have recovered after 24 PM this contractor of 46 years.
For how it could affect an open competition, one can only speculate the little official information.
Has a question of Pravo, the spokesman of the Fund of Terrains Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police had really made an arrest in Plzen on a workplace separate, and this, in the open competition.
"It was a client and in no case of an employee, she said.
The open competition in Cerna as true name "Appeal to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the land" and is put in place when several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people are proposing, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be resolved before being announced the value of the land."
"According to the rights proposed a ranking of buyers is put in place and the Fund Terrains subsequently transferred the ground to the person who has proposed the most senior," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos g. Had, it is clear, the information on people who had registered to the appeal and as it is, also, a person bénéficiare having bought a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to the in the field not to participate in the competition.
And it encaissait is to withdraw.
Which explains why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos g. Had contacts largely above the standards FdT (Fund Terrains).
In the case of the former chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was persecuted for land for which had already published the decision of a construction.
Precisely Lubos g. Had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where should be built the artery of access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he échangea with the town hall for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it might put the construction by a block of land.
Households will pay a hundred krónur monthly housing.
Households will from January pay not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, supplies of heating and in some places rents will also guarantee.
Families must therefore from January to their wallets until a hundred krónur monthly more than now.
Electricity increases of 4.6 percent, the almost 2 percent more expensive, in certain localities, you will have to pay up to a tenth of the water and in many places the supplies of central heating will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is projected to households in the 100 Nkr235 anuellement more than at present.
However all suppliers have lowered the prices of electricity because of the development sensitive to encourage the production of renewable energy, including batteries photovolta Ïques.
The gas to increase moderately but of course when the people most in need to heat and therefore have greater consumption.
We can therefore also a hundred Nkr235.
Although electricity and gas are increasing in the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is the largest common planning the price increase.
For example, households to Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce pay in January for the central heating almost SEK 50 per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than SEK 1000 annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the case where the city is rising rents infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a surcharge of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still part of the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
For example, rents will increase significantly in the 450 apartments rented from January to the end of regulation.
For example, the ICC Byty society which has to Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year to 10 percent.
Czech children are saoûlent in rum and fernet. Beer has gone out of fashion and is slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptional also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that are most often those who saoûlent, which have not yet fifteen years, in the hands of the physician.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the experience of doctors who have similar cases to admissions Hi-lights children.
"The beers and wines are more out of fashion because it takes time to be saoûl."
'The trend is really the spirits, "said to Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Department of children of the hospital Horovice in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chiper a bottle to Daddy in the bed, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka which prevail.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and does not feel," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the hospital Motol, also gives him.
"In general, it is of rum or fernet."
"It is now alcohol fashionable particularly in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a case of slivovice they have brought to the house," added Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, see drunken children aged thirteen and fourteen years to hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working at Horovice since last year, he was Motol where he held ten years in paediatrics where ambulances brought in large schoolchildren around drunk.
"A girl was hospitalized and four times
"It acommencé his career to twelve years when it was involved with 3.5 dansle blood alcohol dansle with a mixture with the extasy," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting is that there was not peculiar to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours," said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the selflessness of parents or their tolerance of the fact that their reject follow the drink which are the main cause of the development of alcoholism.
According to the experts, it does not dependence, in the strict sense, for children.
"As the alcoholic is a chronic alcohol dependence of several years with all the phenomena resulting but not found among children."
"Among those who use the acool with, it is more of a back-ground Yemeni significantly adverse," explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, about forty children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic of paediatrics at Motol.
Are integrated into the stastistiques cases with a grâve poisoning requiring hospitalization.
Children who are drunk after the emergency care sent home by parents or the police, are not counted.
In addition to the children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite according to Pélikan three waves seasonal with count: the day of witches, the Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by spite after poor results, on the contrary they are celebrating the start of the holiday."
"Of course I have lived in the day of a drunken admission of 7 children in a stroke," said Pélikan.
The child drunk who spent the night in the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffering the "hangover."
The headaches in the morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are killed by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are better off because they are a very good evening and a sweet awakening and nothing hurts."
"They are just amazed at where they are," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time at least it jeopardizes the good humour of patients with the note to pay for their care.
The ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care can go up to tens of thousands of wreaths.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education with these children how their drunken has and that they could spend the summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the insurance companies in their management, which should recover from the parents care, do not take the case of children.
Two aircraft L- 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L- 159 five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C- 295 M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS.
This is the first time that this type of devices become the property of someone other than the Army.
They have been abroad in the framework of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is biplaces versions of L- 159 T1 rates up to now in service in the Army and who were in a state of flight.
Lestrois appliances remaining versions of L- 159.
They are for the moment in Aéro Vodochody and the e-Hotline - the firm Omnipol - took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek press department of the Ministry of Defence, the starting physical Vodochody is currently unknown.
'The L- 159 aircraft monoplaces planned for the exchange have been taken on aircraft stored for a long time without charges or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence ."
"The biplaces L- 159 T1 were exchanged in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without shackled loveseat since the department was signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement with a value of 200 million krónur for the transformation of four monoplaces L- 159 unused in two biplaces.
The army has taken delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second is scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clear that whoever takes the L- 159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for the entrainement pilots of NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter of that which takes into account to determine how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L- 159.
The exchange of five L- 159 for a plane Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched tender and has contacted directly EADS.
The direction of the defence arguments while the exchange provides export the L- 159 abroad.
The Army has purchased to Aéro Vodochody 72 appliances and uses 24, wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will probably legal implications.
The European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence of the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen in a tender at European level and in no way by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three aircraft Casa, the latter should arrive at the Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the rot is a sign of low risk of cancer
The men who have the index longer than the rot are exposed to a lower risk of having a prostate cancer.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the finger serves as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should be to the test prostate cancer, particularly by combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants as the antécedents family health, "said Eeles.
During the period of 1994 - 2009 it has followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1500 cancer patients prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the rot.
For them and for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of a prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the rot the risk, however, is down to 33 percent for men 60 years before the reduction of risk was 87 percent.
The report by length of two fingers - trained during the prenatal period - different levels of sex hormones that the child in the womb.
Has less testosterone is an index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that helps to the development of a prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, généticien Czech renowned and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said the KTC that he is aware of this study, but he did not, apparently, that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated."

The US has a new "smart" weapon
The US military has sent in Afghnistan a new weapon "intelligent," known only as the XM- code 25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise
The projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few metres.
The ammunition special 25 mm developed for the gun and containing a highly explosive breaking, functioned as small grenades.
We can AJB00 ammunition in such a way that they explode into contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
We can therefore use against an enemy that hides behind a barrier, a wall or a gap.
It is not protected from above and when it is coming at a rain of rows of steel, it can be to disable also.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of XM- 25, the new gun is the first weapon infantry which uses technology "intelligent."
"The soldier is used mainly in such a way that it is the target, it sends a laser that determines the distance, creates a point of reporting, it corrects its target site and supports the trigger.
"Say you have referred to 543 metres."
"When you squeeze the trigger, the gun is the distance of 543 metres and more or less 1, 2, 3," said Audette.

The next year in July, 400 staff will transfer to Astro Park their place of work, which is currently at the office building of the Mareinbader Square in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As said Wednesday the giant specialising in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located on the place Marienbader of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, huge complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße Unit Niederrad Headquarters in Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 jobs still scattered in the region.
The supply of rental was extremely attractive. Furthermore, the offices to open areas of Astro Park are best suited to the work collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu has been fair tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a key location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He said that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a company overall as Fujitsu.
The new move of a large company within the region did yesterday the joy of winners and losers disappointment.
The head of economic affairs of the City of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith on location."
Fujitsu is in the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (green), regret the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our support for this," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations would not have changed the difficulties of the computers in the face of the owner of the Marienbader Place.
In the end, the economic reasons have been decisive.
It is now to avoid a place if exceptional remains lie empty for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Square of the Hotel de Ville, used so far by the company Fujitsu and the "small vertical" nearby, as well as the rest of the buildings Square Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entry of the city was created between the station and the city Hotel. It generated widespread criticism, not only because of the impressive LPID surfaces that once were part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company rating and investment advice, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for distribution systems of travel, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt GFCCI Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the property fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings have been resold to Spanish society Falcon Real Estate Investments company based in Madrid.
The group Fujitsu is headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it puts computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the region of the Main-Rhein is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, Bad Homburg moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square metres took rented in the building Astro Park.
This old complex of twenty years, whose name recalls its plan star-shaped, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of electronics and electrical engineering.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is becoming very difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers site specialising in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be political pressure suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret letters.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr Assange, who is apparently in England.
The United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with greater force.
The group of cyber-activistes "Wikileaks" has more access to its server housed here in America and is now seeking an ISP in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent US Senator Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"WikiLeaks excluded server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," indicated Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activistes originally revelations via the social network Twitter.
Recently, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents of its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes resorted WCPU Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Goody, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem to Amazon, "they should stop trying to sell books."
The television channel CNN, citing the office of Mr Liebermann, reported that Amazon forbade Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Committee on the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, "the Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon this measure earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said Senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann has urged other countries to reject the use of servers by the platform.
"WikiLeaks is illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and people's lives around the world," according to a statement of the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information provided by the London newspaper "the Independent," the Australian 39 years living in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is found.
The cyber-activiste has consistently called intrigues orchestrated by its detractors prosecution against her by Sweden.
The spokesman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange was particularly concerned for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks hounded and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Head of Government Mr stephen Harper said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could use a "Drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and leaked recently, to engage in.
"I do not know exactly why we need to look at the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," says Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are more important than the assertions of a website."
The US government is now fully tested the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre of the fight against terrorism, has been appointed responsible for combat leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" which after the disclosures diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which the administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US government has announced that he wanted to attend to the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We worked hard to make contact with them," said State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Glace
The "Gelato" Gelato Bologna, preparing confectioners of ice to the best seasons of the year.
The Learn-to-Play course of three days organized for future glaciers has had a very great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where all the ice?
The Glacier and the ice machine.
The, the German confiseur somewhat old-fashioned ice cream factory, according to all the rules of the Italian art for the manufacture of ice.
The turbine to remove ice cream ice of the showcase refrigerated with a spatule, has in the gaufre and then begins to sell.
To find out, we did not need to go to Anzola Dell Emilia in the province.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the ice creams out of its machines are everywhere to Italian high ideals.
The Learn-to-Play course of three days organized for future glaciers has had a very great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses on the ice of chocolate and stretching over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in the glacerie private.
In the midst of a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their yearning desire on the ice is smooth.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of education artistic come to California is a stickler movement Slow Food. He wants to propose an European product quality to the countries of the Glace industrial.
Anke Berlin is in corporate governance and it wants to, after a few years, learn something of singular this work hard on the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another time Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the cleaning lady Canadian came because her children love the creams icy Italian.
The master Luciano Ferrari explains all the participants characteristics ideal ice perfect.
Is crucial not only the good taste, but also the flexibility soyeuse and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during training the icing on the cake of the superstructure national and, in general, southern: "the Italian ice is simply the best, and still retains a dose of romanticism."
The first step in the production seems quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large mélangeur heating to 85 degrees through an electronic programme, then cools immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a tap installed on the machine: it has a cream white basic pasteurized, the foundation of all kinds of ice milk.
The trainer Is immediately deluged with question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can limit the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against will be misled by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who does not ice "made from natural ingredients," perhaps despite this used stabilisers: the more often a natural product, for example, of seed of guar achieved from the bean guar.
It is of course possible to manufacture ice without use of stabilising, just to sell within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer croquera nothing other than pellet ice.
Some of the mass modifications are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one gains in the fruit or sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are the powder and pulp.
"Suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of ingredients flavoured."
"However, you should simply try."
In the revenues of sorbets fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the icy creams made from the mass of white, by adding eggs becomes a cream yellow and is, when you add the cocoa powder, the basis of all the possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the use machines to ice.
Luciano invites them from time to time to produce four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnuts with or without eggs in the dry, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice to the fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée: from the point of view of taste, it is not necessarily better.
The ice hazelnuts does not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The ice in the kiwis, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less of stabilising.
"Only a balanced mix is properly the taste of ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise in calculation: if the puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar is reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for the ice to the lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (wine producers use to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice does not require, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
This is not only the machine manufacturing autocategorizers mass basic aid.
There is also a device which is simultaneously the mixture of ice available to make it onctueux and reduced to low temperatures.
In spite of all the automatisations, minor failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barbouille of fruit puree from head to feet and, thus, éclabousse his comrades studies when control of the huge bowl mélangeur escapes.
The master Luciano is of the opinion that a "incident is likely to occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
The supervisors in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that tested the cultivation of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the group of experts Testbiotech which is regarded as an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Wednesday in Munich Mr Christoph subsequent work, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports that the president of the group of experts Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by the groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper worked considerably to the requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr subsequent work.
The requirements developed correspond directly, by paragraphs, the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and wear and the brand of the industry that, basically, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of the Efsa has recently joined without condition or without transitional period the group relashionship Swiss Syngenta. In doing so, it has changed sides.
Not long ago, even the Radio Germany Central (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union monitors and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion of both the German Federal Environment Agency of the MEPs.
However, the Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it exploits all reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of good quality.
It does not prohibit experts working for the Efsa to establish contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr Kuiper admits that it works for the International Institute for life sciences (International life sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together, among other things, in the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr subsequent work resent the fact that genetically modified crops are accepted without any test feeding the animals and that it was not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize field," says Mr subsequent work.
The current practice is to test the proteins isolated and not the genetically modified plant, which makes it impossible to obtain reliable results.
"If we don't seek the risks, how can we find out?" Asked Mr subsequent work on an accusatory tone.
It is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific conducts research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working on the polytechnic of Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is trying to influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
That is why, it is barely even researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the opinion of businesses, the critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck says that "the industry control security research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell is achieved, a total of 400 kilo.
On Monday afternoon, she was before the Stuttgart with its tube on the back.
There was manif.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, excavators came and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was the same: Several thousands of people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the Central station Stuttgart in an underground station which will cost billions.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration led to the arrest of construction.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the limestone coquillier) of Crailsheim, a cat and rude poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a sculptor 43 years to Ostfildern.
He has brought a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He said with enthusiasm: "a rock modest and cheap, simple and land."
He said that the etched in the month, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what it will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell.
Traces of the Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire of stones.
The 44 -year-old made the trade in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were concassées or if they disappear in the discharge" he says in his office in a mud hut, which was once a guardhouse.
He said that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north to the business of demolition.
But he has negotiated for days on end with the opponents of the project S21.
And he said it could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 have subsequently won one of the parallélépipède stone weighing 80 kilos valued at between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some as memory in while also hoping to make it at a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tonnes, 25 cargo full of a lorry.
About half is still packed together in the forest, the rest being long sold.
Owners of gardens, gardeners, their Particuliers.
They are coming from everywhere and have won everything that could go into the trunk and trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart turned in "Mäuerle" or limitations of strength of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" said Mr Rongen.
"There eut-été this component policy."
His car, the rounds of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He attended law school that he has abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before turning to the computer and finally become a carrier.
And a fan of stones.
It stores 40000 tonnes.
It is hoarding treasures everywhere in Germany.
It is the largest merchant ancient stones.
It is réfrène.
Stones of sand sculptées with art are laid on the snow.
"Traditionally, Elles were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, "he says.
"My favourite stone."
It takes the path through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre of red sand, previously, part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertin."
The parallélépipède was once part of the gallery of the Neckarstadion Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the police, the granite reddish from the cathedral Blasien saint, the tuf from the hospital Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr Rongen believe that once the stones were sculptées and displaced by palans simple and carts pulled by horse, it becomes very respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was shattered."
It is not become rich, still less rich.
But this carrier currently employs 14 people. In addition, tailors of stones, a sculptor, a smith, a souffleur glass and a gardener in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the recycler of waste.
Soon, he will be in Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Fight of talent for the senior potential
The counter is a strong turnout.
16 Students are lining up to buy bread rolls of salmon, baked and blancs-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
In the framework of a competition of ideas, they must speak in the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, the firm Volkswagen.
These days, many companies do not hesitate to go to the hand-to-hand in competition to find the best brains and to engage, as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruter graduates the most gifted as much as possible in lecture theatres before arriving on the labour market and they are courted by the other.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performance of their students, trying to identify the exceptional skills in the framework of practical projects and loyalty.
The second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig group car amadoue talent.
A young lady of service personnel sharing the pens, sweets and maps with the logo of Volkswagen.
It speaks of the coe. Int. Professionals and students of jobs for young talent; it shows roads for access to the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with this industrial sector and gaining in experience."
"The Volkswagen group, it can be students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"Traditionally, the focus was on the project professional," says Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more intense.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their staff through a sorting on a host of candidates.
But they must highlight their reliability and especially woo the highly qualified workforce.
It is mainly from the graduates of engineering who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the gap for posts engineer grows.
Novel Dykta goes to the hunt for talent for KPMG, the auditing firm, accounting and advisory.
It Information-Non-Governmental of costly events aimed at the recruitment of talents, such as the race KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of rallye-papier where competitors must find their way to the coordinated GPS.
The company will send hope-raising eight students next year so they travel to the United States.
Participants can also visit subsidiaries of KPMG and the company.
Who should participate decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of many candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search of potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the pack through the race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the hunter of talent that is Mr Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until now, we have been in contact with all those involved last year to a similar action."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to send their applications to our business." He said.
Outside the amadouement direct carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are very traditional by participating in trade fairs where they are engaged in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve the graduates participating in trade shows."
"For example, in the of solar technologies," said Mrs Sitha Stübe, director of human resources in Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the problem.
Currently, 35 posts are placed in the competition on the site of the company.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is expensive and time-consuming," guarantee?
Another way to establish the contact is to go through the university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to develop professional or write his draft. Administers."
Advertising campaigns expensive solar specialists are announced.
That is why the company is trying to make his advertising highlighting other qualities: atmosphere, personalised hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do that," supports Mrs Stübe, chief of staff.
Long ago that the money is no longer the main role in the job search.
The flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is in 55 th Place among the top 100 employers of Germany.
The institute is a honour annual German employers.
To this end, interviewing the collaborators on their degree of satisfaction with their work and to watching the conditions of employees.
The chief of staff Mrs Stübe hope that this investment will enhance the image of society among job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly to external assessments regarding a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of academy German DEBA (Deutscher employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more of authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means above all to take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make attractive is through its own staff," he says.
It is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the strategy of internal image, i.e. The creation of the image of the employer within its own workforce.
"The FoPs satisfied with the best messengers."
When treats its employees and they identify with the company, they are alone advertising of their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if it was playing in an orchestra," says Mr Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the State of the United States, in the years to come.
The government of Washington made a ban a ban equivalent and, thus, definitively abolished its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" which is at the root of this strict ban. It must remain in force at least for the next five years.
Faced with this accident which claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the sector of activity, said he was willing to allow the implementation of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries for supplies of oil.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the oil spill devastating in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of billion, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze drilling imposed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and tougher safety, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms in depth.
At the same time, Mr Obama announced the lucrative tax breaks groups--to gas and oil.
The actors in this sector of activity now publicly that the flow of food in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case so far.
"The's goal is to put the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the outcome of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the ban on drilling pronunciado Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance regret the uncertainty which characterises this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
The investments made in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is well-functioning brown; it is a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: Because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live of theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do not chase," the environmentalist journalists for calm: "You still enough mud of oil to the lens of water."
The Nigerian 37 years has tried to take a photograph of a young drove in the water up to the chest, and the trail fat that surrounds it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the sparkle of water to the colour of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown water of crude oil.
On the side of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom said that there was the shrimp by buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely exhausted.
Five years ago, an enormous quantity of oil poured out of a pipeline has exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen living in the small town nearby Bodo must now pull for six hours to reach the fishing grounds: the country Ogoni located at the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the most polluted in the world.
The full extent of the devastation Barnavi leafing through the marshes of mangrove forests by watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the boat motor gut-wrenching water brown cradingue. Anyone who has his hand cut off any mixture of oil.
The roots of small mangrove forests emerge from the soil as sticks of pipes. The palm trees isolated sadly hang their diver.
We look in vain for the clouds of birds, as it in the wetlands: Dés motors stops, a bizarre silence falls in this paradise of old who resembles a petrol station by the smell.
"What is happening here, it is war against the environment," says Mr Celestine Akpobari air sad: "Our life is characterised by a constant danger health."
The comparison is made.
The region where the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers have entered here; the first was held in the 1980 s by Ken saro-wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the group Shell had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return Ogoni is prohibited in this society: as more than 2 million barrels of oil daily are being siphoned off through more than 5000 oil wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines in the region of the Delta, three times as large as Switzerland, the country's oil fields are Ogoni untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this group.
Every few hundred metres stand in water tréteaux steel as bizarre sculptures: It is very affectionate "Christmas trees" heads of drilling holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion until the benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling of this nature is broken from time to time, as a steady stream of crude oil flows in the water.
According to the estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has passed into the sea at the time of the accident super-pétrolier "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should be the responsibility of environmental pollution persistent? The answer to this question divides the player.
For the group Shell, sabotage and the siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions heads of drilling and oil pipelines perforated as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner reproached the group Shell to apply in Nigeria safety standards essentially less strict than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of defaults behaviour is "still much higher than alleures."
Some emerging forms of wetlands to a place that, from afar, like a workshop abandoned, full of work and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered in to work.
A fire scintille under one of the many casks which sometimes associated with pipes, sometimes scattered without charge on the site must be répérés: a small refinery illegal.
It was heat crude oil in the water for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, to the end of the conduct of drops kerosene fall and the finally diesel.
That is how Michael and his four assistants produce daily four barrels of diesel and 300 litres: "It paints 34 000 Naira," approximately $22.
The people of the Delta take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producer in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Refiners illegal can sell at a cheaper price than ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per litre of diesel: Because they acquire gratuitement their raw material.
It is offered by the "protectors" which the network of oil pipelines leaking across the country Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part insignificant part of the raw material is temporarily stored illegally purifiée: the organised crime networks which are also among its members of politicians and military officials, the lion's share of tankers and the dumping on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities at the population or mode of production lax is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But in the meantime, the relations of the Ogoni especially to Shell so deteriorated that there was no longer question that the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be the subject of an arrest, but at most they will offer bribes.
Even the soldiers mainly from the north of the country will benefit as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"At any point of view, this rotten trick our country," Akpori regret.
Investigators discover flaws in the reactors of the A380
The A380 is clearly a major security problem.
An apparatus which has made an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible default of construction that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had clearly been luckier: During the investigation, the Australian air safety authority has found that the reactors of some aircraft A380 presented a serious security problem, and it warns against a possible default of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause coves of fatigue and leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, been in a statement published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of reactors."
Are concerned the reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 of the A380 aircraft series.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, who had to land emergency on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint in a federal court Australian based in Sydney. This approach gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Mr Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Coins have spare and long chalk was damaged during the fire engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil which is responsible for the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators have announced that other tests relating to security will be done on the superjumbos who are also equipped with the reactors in questions.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman of the ASTB, Mr Martin Dolan.
The problem of security is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had stopped its entire fleet of for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor A380.
The plane to two floors is the largest airliner in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causing chaos in the transport
Germany covered in white: in one night, the snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter shivering Germany: As frigid temperatures, almost all of the republic is covered by snow in the Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, coverage reached 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 at Flensburg, the winter has worked on a permanent basis, but they have not been able to overcome the snow to accumulate.
In addition, fierce gusts have swept across the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The federal Office maritime and water (DSH) is expected to flood to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1,2 m above normal.
The mass of snow on motorways and roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Central warning of bad weather Meteomedia announced the level of alert violet was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong winds and costs have dispersed.
Several lorries and cars have remained stuck at night.
Even in the land of saxe-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced severe disruption on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, the snow and the wind have led to of the movement and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snow hit motorways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, trees fell on the railways, the caténaires needles or destroyed.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
To Sallfeld, in Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Exploring snow have caused many flight cancellations in the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The service winter over a continuous-cover service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are more numerous, despite that barely 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents have occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening to Ostholstein, a truck driver has died in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, that is why the road from Bayreuth at Nuremberg was closed until the hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30 -year-old woman died when his car was on a slippery road to Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists shows some good news: The snow is still weak and dried, but it tourbillonnera in case of small gusts.
But, the wind.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong winds and fast.
It is however very cold, up to 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The building could yield up to 500 million Euro.

Thousands of people mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for minors who have been declared dead in the wake of several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been able to recover the body because the security situation in the affected wells continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 Minors between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had found no sign of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team has been able to the mine for security reasons.
After the second bang violent, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could be increased.
Today, parents and friends held a party to the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a sun shining Greymouth south of the island of New Zealand.
They have observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors buried, 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.

In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats have taken part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors origin South African and British were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers have begun to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of South Island of New Zealand.
The Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told journalists that when the masses of gas explosives are misplaced, temperatures burning inside the mine began to fall.
Goes to hell, warrior!
The film is a film Splatter artificial?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the former race through his film, "Valhalla Rising," of course.
How public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn he might think in ccsa.ca. "Valhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) owning only one eye is captured; he broke free of his executioner and, with an almost supernatural, eliminates opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses methods of brutal assassination. When it is in a bad mood, he rips the gut of its enemies without waiting until they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed says no word on his true name. Even the other characters leave escape, at most, in one or two sentences a few cries of agony appalling.
Otherwise, nothing is said and festoie in the mountainous incredibly beautiful landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
It would be ideal more filmmakers mature with an interest in the existentialisme and for the travellings excellent.
When a film is several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher," his trilogy on the drug smuggler fierce and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refuses to make a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality cinema arts.
Most of the supporters of cinema art must be in the face of the brain that is spreading around and bowel.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed sailed, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising that "Valhalla Rising" has found no distributor of films in Germany and that there is in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, behind a pretentious and bloody.
It is not a question of dialogue in this film, and a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape.
Refn grants him barely a moment of détente and slowly cut the throat with images Wilkinson and a soundtrack dismal, but especially with hatred elusive which comes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young boy Virginia, faithfully alongside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose mobile are never known, but that to hell at any time to fight enemies and allies temporarily turning into warrior, is perhaps sent the devil himself.
It is the state, but perhaps also, for those who are, in any way, ."
"Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hating or admire, the agitation, the enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious work of Caterpillar
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone to be subject to the control of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes attacked a mysterious form design on the Syrian territory.
It is on the side of the euphrate; the largest city near lies 30 kilometres is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in the documents of the IAEA, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has reportedly built with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electrical current.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would produce nuclear weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950 s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation of satellite images.
Through the animation computer-aided, said the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant, which represents a copy of the nord-Coréen miniature model of the nuclear plant in Yongbyon.
In addition, she has presented the photos showing the building, even within it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped for fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information than at the time, and even, with time the mystery deepens more and more.
The former US president George w. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor to el-Kibar, but peu' indications that country was "an active nuclear weapons."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they see the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They lack of hard evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Asked about the way we have to ensure that there is a nuclear reactor, a diplomat from the United Nations has a laconic reply in summer by saying that the IAEA had "documents enough to ask questions."
The Syrian have certainly abducted with haste the rubble of the "unused military building" and an orderly resolution of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of experts from the IAEA led by the former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, was discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received a Member State images of satellite providers commercial showing the moment that the attaque. It seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the sponsor anonymous, perhaps Israel, has exclusivity.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret nuclear program and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles as implausible.
Since then, damas refuses any discussion on this issue, as on images of satellite.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and denied access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comments on this issue."
That is how the investigation of this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and that it "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to achieve progress, the existence of three other facilities must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities it is here, and what is their function or what they suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of the neighbouring towns.
The independent Institute Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) of Washington has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images of a complex near Masyaf that would most probably one of the objects suspects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access of the three sites to inspectors from the IAEA.
In Vienna, it that the Syrians fear that the group inspection is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
Indeed, it is an intelligence provided by the US secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos, indicating that the vehicles were made shuttles between the three sites and the parallélépipède stone to airlift substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be used to production fuel ."
He would have "no indications concerning sensitive activities," such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor works certainly thanks to not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is the rigour of plausible assumptions concerning fundamental questions: where should have come uranium and where she later separated plutonium needed for a bomb.
We do not know whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks calpixque will have disappeared, nobody will have information on the place of storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has done in 1998 the salt mine to al-Tibni, located just a few miles of el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can agree on the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently afdeling satellite pictures for the famous magazine Jane's, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
The satellite pictures show that Syria has undertaken of earth-moving work in the three sites suspects and displaced huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped to remove suspicions.
As he said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to be. This plan to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only time invested shows how great interest the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also responded to this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna did not state the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, "says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States a few months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful of the International Atomic Energy Agency to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open to the future," but it is still.
This is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives réflechir: "At this point, if At the end they do not find anything"
The love in a time of war
Tough times since that Angelina Jolie has made its debut in the summer as a maker.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We know nothing about this story, but it is enough to provoke unrest.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love executioner Serbian during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women protested immediately protested. In response, some sequences shot in Sarajevo have been displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a letter addressed to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress. Gorgeous itself Goodwill Ambassador UNHCR.
It is not diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed that these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"The meeting to be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There has been no stories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie says on its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently, recommended that the United Nations high commissioner to withdraw the quality of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his scenario, after some hesitation authorization of shooting in Sarajevo, but we do not know why is not then come despite this authorisation.
The young author itself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is a great deal of effort that it has of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintained that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the possibility to all parties involved to speak.
It remains vague on the content.
And so a second synopsis of the film on the Net. It is quite different: the love knew well before the start of the war. It meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the concentration camp where Serbian man works as guardian.
This is a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is amourache executioner."
The film of Jolie started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, and Jolie, is "unfair and based on information erronnées."
Now, only the fanatics Hollywood can provide peace: in this scenario illegally in the Net, like others before.
Let us!
This evening, everything is going well again among the Irish.
No trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans are shouting for joy on the basis of a strong music, they could.
Baileyu-pub Cork in south irlande vibrates because the players involved and manage to unseat bullets of table tennis at a distance of three metres in gobelets beer of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "bière-pong." The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket to go in January in Las Vegas in the world championship bière-pong.
This Tanner is an individual calm; this subtle game to drink and the computer scientist reserved, these two do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26 -year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn on the question térébrante, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in its projects. In January, he will job interviews in New Zealand.
"I do have a strange feeling," he says.
"The country is so far and I have no job."
Finally: His copine already in Auckland, "in less than two, she won her job wanted as responsible for project factual, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of the bleak prospects for the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lies in Sydney, his brother Colin now occupies a computer consultant in London.
The young move: the situation of most of the families who live on the island are similar to that of tanning.
Experts from the Institute of economic and social research indicate that 100,000 Irish people leave their countries.
They even a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4,5 million inhabitants.
If the forecast holds, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980 s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish were, the grief takes place.
The economic crisis, however, especially young Irish people, well trained, who have been so far that moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three in ten under thirty years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes many letters from readers produced by young people, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is going downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but in the possibilities, leaves and our country as a whole generation."
"The last to leave out the light."
The student in law Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of Irish students, highlighting a darker future because the government is to pull the wool over the eyes and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to a practice not paid to another.
It states that are its biggest concerns is to emigrate itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue.
Mclarnon organizes the "government-backed Working abroad Expo" which offers a full support on the theme "work abroad."
"But the work abroad is the new in the profession is an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the levels of the professional," says.
His website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and surfers snow in Canada.
The message is clear: Travailler abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for the engineer for 29 years, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector th Germany.
A house of fashion fate in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other projects Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O Donovan only rarely visit his country home, because it is in a position of extra work, in order to conclude to repay the credit contracted to build his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit daft," he said in crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost more."
He broke out of an embarrassed laugh by crossing the cold chambers.
The small house is in a residential area with gardens of before well treated, expensive cars of major brands are stationed on access routes.
Four years ago, O Donovan has bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent.
"There were moments of madness, without doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Afraid to see any collapse because of the credit?
O Donovan thinking for a moment, once hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young, same everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like lamentations that it is often these days.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as the once lived here in the island," he says.
"Working for a time abroad, this is not what can happen to worse, perhaps this is what makes us feel first Irish.
He laughs and then spoke of his father who went in England in the last major economic crisis.
"It was to return after spending seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea appeals to this Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life is happening elsewhere.
In her career, it already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and for his copine.
But there is still something that concerns in recent days: the party to hold on its 27 th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into evening farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says with a long sweep of beer.
"A farewell, it is worrying."
"Call it rather an evening goodbye, relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The routine democratic
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as to private enterprise.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the US in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by the Economist.
Since the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two elements stand out of the results of the survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after a sharp fall in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, depressing the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents from the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but rising sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have shaken the support for democracy.
If it has lasted for the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many of America was a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a network of social security has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Americans living in poverty have risen only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its incumbent president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where the violent crimes have multiplied.
It is only the second time since the survey began more than respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say that they or their have been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support to private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents from the region say that private enterprise is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% of the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% (compared to 18% last year), followed by the US (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote tainted
No one expected to have a general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the "outsiders" who wanted to help the stricken country and in fear.
It was presented boxes and a new ballot papers scattered in the goutières, of polling stations ransacked and intimidation
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many of Hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, had slipped in the neighbourhood finding out where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and have called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they do not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are beholden to René Préval, unpopular outgoing President, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
Myself, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250 000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians themselves.
The toes to the center
The weeks after having become suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rating of 20 points, to more than 50%; it is to its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, transforming it into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year might depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, visibly in mourning, that it would abandon the intransigence of her late husband and predecessor, former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this connection, the signs remain unclear.
Mr Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife takes as chairman, used to develop budgets which under-appreciate tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has allowed the first couple to spend the extra money at will.
The government of Mrs Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was thrown into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the members of the ruling Peronist movement have rallied to Mrs Fernández.
But following chaotic (where a parliamentary hit in the face one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), Congress does not to approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president still more flexibility to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now at 11,1% but many private estimates and wage claims of trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
He has refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which has made falsifications of official statistics on inflation.
Mrs Fernández can now moderate these policies?
She has called for talks between private companies and the union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by high world prices for agricultural exports of Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
This is perhaps why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to re-establish the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected a previous restructuring forced debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Boudou Amado, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; what looks like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of its mandate, now that her husband is no longer with him.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy for it will reflué.
If it wants to win another election, it will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, many of the policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
The Taiwanese voters are geared towards a kind of a closer links with the continent.
What Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7,5 million voters are presented on 27 November, 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five city districts, in what is seen as a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself become a substitute for the feelings of the continent, with ties innovative business, including a free trade pact, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five local authorities, it has failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the démocrate-progressiste Party (DPP), which has opted for the independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all the votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential elections, Mr Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of the vote of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event has revealed most of the main topics of Taiwanese elections, including trucks and aggressive campaign flags of gathering mass with girls who danced with minimal.
An assassination attempt mysterious mandatory has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, has done a tour for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd fired on the young Mr Lien, purely through his face, wounding and killing a bystander.
Strangely, it has not been determined if the shooter wanted to hurt Mr Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and by turning electors to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking that the question of the continent itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have been with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and dislikes the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid putting its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also failed to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr Ma, for its part, has demanded a confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
It is expected that the government in Beijing continues to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to delude Taiwan, of the eerie.
China lost no time to send a negotiator in Taipei to organise a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see a political integration; but let us start at the beginning.
It is better to wait until after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, it was bad: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocative in favour of independence.
But a new generation of moderate has grown under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who has served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, on condition that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party is a "trustworthy" compared to the hasty approach of Mr Ma on China.
Mr Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates of the PDP would have fared better if they insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He has even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP will find it hard to choose between its potential candidates.
It is that the KMT makes introspection.
The assessments of Mr. Ma have been low, despite economic growth, the KMT candidate did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his cabinet and local offices will be revised.
The good results of the PDP suggests that the support of Taiwan for the rapprochement.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Appointments to Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category of "best new artist"
Done at the request of a president, and people are required to do so.
Esperanza Spalding, the bassiste jazz singer and 26 -year-old withered away by President Obama to be the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of "best new artist."
Given that Spalding is a very well-known on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not emerge out of three albums before registration; what "establishes the public identity of that artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," was certainly a step forward and, given his style voice slightly, his skilful hands of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible for at least a large boxes to Spalding compared to the brilliant success Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent to the voters of Grammy Awards taking into account the production of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer TRIO in the category "instrumental album," a transferred on a shiver revigorant registration which was one of the favourite crucial last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody's 4 B" of saxophoniste veteran James Moody's and "Positootly" of claviériste John Beasley will be particularly in competition.
Shorty trombones, favourite to Me of New Orleans and invited to "Treme" of HBO, has been honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; which bows strongly towards a merger with certain albums Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognition in the category Provedoria Together; in competition with the fittest chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and the eternal aventurier Dave Holland, whose album "pathways" of its octet' 's live was a good example of the democratic control of this bassiste as group leader.
Appointment of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the conventional categories
The conventional appointments for the 53 th annual Awards Grammy contain a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the list of, "Deus identified Machina" Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an orchestrale electric, with three "yes."
Among the nominees with links to the Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for its Toussaint no. 4, "Los Angeles," a work which was commissioned by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also vying for a reward.
The conventional appointments are spread over 13 categories covering recordings of the orchestra, opera, choir and solo.
A category for the producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The appointments for the classic album are Symphonies no. 3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Orchestra of the Royal Concertgebouw; "Deus identified Machina" and "Metropolis" Symphony of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and SYNERGY Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal opera House, "Marc Antonio th Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse's'Ars Lyrica Houston; "the Love of Loin" of Kaija Saariaho the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "the Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Altenburg Theatre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count Pärt for Toussaint no. 4, Daugherty for "Deus identified Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus, Magnus Lindberg for" Graffiti "and Shchedrin for" the Wanderer Enchanted ."
The Toussaint no. 4 of Pärt has had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The of approximately 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-magnat oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, jailed in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was nominated for instrumental soloist with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he aviat writing the work of 15 minutes specifically for the interpreter to the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concerts with the Metropolis Together, in New York.

In the category of conventional blends, the soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his registration "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the mosque of Temecula won the approval of the planning committee.
A draft mosque to Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it was the promotion of terrorism as well as traffic congestion.
But the Commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious comply with local laws and that it would be esthétiquement impressive.
"A lot of people came to support: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you say," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They have just been very strong."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18 PM and lasted until almost midnight, with most of the time, people calling for or against the centre, the time almost equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate has continued on the newspaper's Web site.
"There is more of America," wrote.
"This is another planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The Islamic centres planned also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of about 135 families co-existe without incident in the county of Riverside for years but she wanted more space and better than the warehouse that she has rented on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be composed of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would be a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas approximately two miles to the east of the school Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers found the bacteria unusual here on Earth, they say that this shows that life opportunities beyond the major elements which were considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life really" foreign, "said Paul Davies c. W. Of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovery in the lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after having replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar d. Of the University of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize the life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, which did not divulge the details of the discovery, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other environments, agencies might be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that the" standard "elements, that we believe it absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of Science and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrologie NASA, who led the study, has chosen the lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to two substances could be able to substitute one to another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to that of the phosphorus."
"As a result, the agencies have difficulty determining these components separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different to that it does not work exactly as phosphorus; he got inside and, in some way, pulls together the work of our biochemical machine," said Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ- 1 and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that he can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, or elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie s. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, "she says; thus, researchers have speculated that the first life forms could use it.
This suggests that there may be other ways of life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs exposure stolen were found to Compton
The other two dogs exposure on four stolen from outside a motel to Bellflower were found, the marshals in Los Angeles County anoncé Thursday.
The four dogs exposure - two akitas and two corgis pembroke Welsh - have disappeared Tuesday when someone has stolen the truck Chevy Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs have been recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the department of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs go well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good form."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We do not want to say Whitmore," he said.
"We are following orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
They have been gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas county in an animal locatedon Downey.
The sheriff's deputies have found the truck and the two dogs separately to Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3 -year-old male, and Didi, a female of 10 months - were safe and sound, the authorities have announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, for of the owners of dogs Japanese, were worn disappeared until their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Reding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the national championat "AKC / Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions other events planned in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC / Eukanuba," said Peek the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the judgments of the as-and-when-needed canine exposure canine nearly a month.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and garent their camper outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the chamber of the motel.
But they have left the Akitas and the corgis, fur thicker in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the truck at 6 PM on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to corgis, with a microchip to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to be of, the restructuring of GMMs is awaiting the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, GMMs has finally been given the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, has officially on Thursday praised the plan "pre-packaged" by the creditors that approximately $5 billion of debt would be deleted; paving the way for the business of entertainment, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television.
With Thursday's decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, no legal obstacle will to GMMs to stay afloat under the tutelage of the founders of entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General of what will be a lighter.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 in 400.
GMMs will not emerge really Chapter 11 as; Chase will not have a credit facility of $500 million, planned to finance the new operations and products of GMMs.
She is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is itself to $75 million, and should be funded to mid-December.
The process of restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & co. Began to advise the direction on how to get its finances as it did not afford to pay the interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, the director general, Harry Sloan, has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts to Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of conducting research and the more than 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders including none of them was willing to pay the sum of $2 billion of which creditors were to research.
In the spring of this year, we have to redo while the team of GMMs had started work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When GMMs officially coming out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, businesses Moelis and Cooper bonuses of dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1,2 million, will receive a payment of $9,5 million.
Cooper, who have collected $375 000 per month for their services of the company, will receive a "bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account boost production of GMMs, which has released only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265 000 000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be done by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which holds about 18% of the debt of GMMs, has tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate entertainment, where it is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
I think toys to maintain your budget gifts in balance
Although the main candidate for the toy the most wonderful of this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the system of video game of Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a substantial damage in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bicycles BMX $99 and a game Kinect cost the same price as 10 strings to jump classic pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three sellers national toys - Wal-Mart, toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law --Moore has evolved, the toy of this year is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, there is generally less new toys associated with Web sites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more tender.
And toys to button cells are increasing, as well as toys to rechargeable batteries.
A few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press down.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows for a song.
If you buy several, they sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you cannot stop you.
To combine the song to dance, dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
On the technology Elmo Live last year, the doll animatronique 14 -inch plays games in turn as Simon Says and can dance lunar thanks to its feet articulated innovative with blocking wheels.
Children who have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 80 s, you will recall of Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is to return (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of cards game questionnaire designed to transform still floating in a car in a session with an auto-correction and filing floodgates.
If you are suspicious when your child is your smartphone, three alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheaper and easier to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the range Leapster, with a screen more recent and brighter.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses a system like iTunes to offer games and books and has an entry for EAs card display photos of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before that time, it is ideal for a competition of impromptu.
Increasingly, the toys have a kind of connection online.
In on their presence in the shops of toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix N 'Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years), which includes a room of a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives sufficient money to the store Club Penguin for two choices.
It can be roller or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last micro-robots cell button.
The false bestiole moving quickly on 12 pasta implants vibrant in random directions.
It is amusing to a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop of the kitchen table and even a passage momentarily in the hangover of our dog.
Make a softer side in maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait a place of the city as a sergeant urban training by visiting severely its expenses, with orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - responsible large public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"You right!"
"Be shrillness!"
Show them, "he says," the beautiful girls! "
Four girls barely past adolescence in white gloves, colourful of jackets and trousers identical en129 oil, is figeaient nicely.
Four pairs of shoes in Achilles, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated well but at the top of hair attached by a drop in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have a seemingly average," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are nice."
More than a government has tried to refresh the image of inspectors urban China.
A city has required that all new recruits have a diploma.
The Guangdong province has exchanged gris-vert uniforms against a blue supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by the strong: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded a trolley to snack uncontrollable by launching black eyes, firmly for half a hour, until the colporteur remballe its affairs and parte.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation of image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its police street in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police dégrossie a kinder, more feminine.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty in attracting the eyes on this brigade urban underground of China
And for good reason, critics say.
Contrary to the police, are allowed to enforce the municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei have beaten to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film in the beginning to disperse a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing, stolen and online, describes how defeat effectively offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a colporteur of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available by download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained on the street sellers.
"Chengguan marked the government," suffered last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy on the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "complete cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far.
After that the district has spent an announcement in October to find eight new recruits, an editorial, published in the Beijing Evening News, was asked if women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district required female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years, to have a great figure and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have bigger than the average of 1,6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.

Officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"It is their image that is important," said an at rednet.com district officer, a Web site quasi-gouvernementale.
"Firstly, the qualities of external candidates will determine whether they agree; it is about the size, weight, features of the face, etc"
Then come the temperament and the "qualications Home."
The women of Chengguan are like vases of flowers, he said, adding: "In addition to be vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the office of management of the city, does not subscribe to this description.
But he noted that the requirements for the standard were the norm standard in many job offers Chinese for both sexes.
This is the case of the exigeance on the order of the features of the face.
That means that it is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, the disabled or disfigured should not apply.
"We cannot let a person or a bossu come serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"It is not a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrol on the place Baoguang nearly a monastery, is 22 and has the pommelées cheeks with a mouth finely incurvées.
It does not consider the development of its appearance as sexist, there said.
"Do you think that look sexy in this uniform?" She asked a vacuous air.
Xu Yang, his colleague to fossettes aged 21, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose that their mandate is limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen itinerant traders who move quickly to walk, trying to sell as much as possible of buns or bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We have already said several times!," said Mrs Xu while a seller has fled on foot, temporarily abandoning its vélo-charrette noodles.
The agents describe their functions rather monotonous.
"This is about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who studied marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that the female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property sellers.
They can threaten to point out that the offenders to their superiors male.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of false rumours that the agents of the chengguan had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the chengguan were injured, 14 vehicles have been reversed or set on fire.

Officers have seized a motorcycle which was being put right on the pavement rather than in a store, as the imposes regulation.
The owner of the motorbike was the scandal.

Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his badge White returned to hide his name.
As the officers female, the coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain an image cirée.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we are fighting physically," said Mr Li said a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public begins."
Prosecutors did not inculperont Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, arising from a case linked to an assistant to a former campaign and his efforts to obtain a work of lobbying for the husband of the woman, have anoncé Wednesday lawyers Senator.
The decision ends the legal the most serious threat faced by Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was seen as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential election of 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case to the national headlines last year and damage to his career.
The office of Mr Ensign said he was "very pleased" by the decision, which is the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Lawyers for Mr Ensign said the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that it did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many lawyers ethics outside the Department of Justice, that there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a criminal prohibition federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, relating to the case of Senator with it.
Mrs Hampton once served as treasurer during a campaign of Ensign.
Mr Ensign has contacted a number of donors policies to find work for Mr. Hampton and, then, he defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law of lobbying from his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems at odds with the absolute ban of the revolving door of lobbying.
To the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in the defence of clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the department refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks cashed by its section of the public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against the former senator Ted Stevens accused of lack of prosecution.
The federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take up arms, "said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that has received several complaints against Mr Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now take the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, of Mr Ensign Senior Counsel, said in an interview that he had received on Monday a telephone call from a prosecutor of the department of Justice and the next day, saying that the department did not seek charges against his client.
The team of lawyers of Mr Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments that he had done.
"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," at-il said.
Last month, the federal Elections Commission has decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint by the independent ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96.000 by the parents of Mr Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission has said that she did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada who has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find work of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company has welcomed Mr Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of staff, John Lopez, Mr Ensign contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelait" the Ministry of Interior on an issue.
Mr Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When the news of the case have surfaced last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his as leader fourth Republican in the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr Ensign was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and would put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, "she says.
The appeal of Cheshire will flow to Twitter
A dozen of them were in the process of in the rows of the courtroom.
They were all the minutes of the reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
At the end, the defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, widely followed the trial of Steven j. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the family, Cheshire in Connecticut, should lead to a formal end where the judge would impose the death penalty, adopted by the board.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already table elements to the court that outlines arguments, likely to be in the courts for years.
What is of course is that the intense reports on the trial - and the widespread use and extended by journalists of the Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," a saturation so widespread and instant with inflammatory details that the board has been influenced by the passions of the public.
Demand could push the appeal judges to debate on the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"I experienced at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas j. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon c. Blue Superior Court of State, has rejected the claims in the judgment last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board would have been driven by the passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeal courts recognize for decades that the media coverage of the notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment of 1966 landmark, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an osteopaths Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was a carnival atmosphere of of the trial "because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television and film "the fugitive."
Some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal for review half a century later the condemnation of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general right to worry about the impact of new media" in the trial, said John j. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it has been applied arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue says that some judges appeal could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is one of many described by counsel for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; delaying the execution.
Defence lawyers say, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when the judge Blue has refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing photos of macabre scenes criminal in the selection board.
Some of the jurors said they had been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years.
Defence lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge has unjustly expelled one juror, who had been critical to prosecutors, and he has improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual decision to get the jury deliberations in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the post of governor and Senate of the United States.
They have maintained that the media computer over fanning the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The scrambling daily tweets media, cameras and journalists to the palace of justice," the lawyers wrote, "looked nothing of what has been seen before, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the cover of the system Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that the new instant were more inflammatory than the communiqués issued more slowly, was a luddiste that cutting the policy of the Court governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal étaitent often lured by the arguments that social changes and technological need an adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they are a reference to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 which ousted the condemnation of Dr Sheppard because of media coverage of the trial and they have that they invoqueraient the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," écrivaient-ils ," is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21 th century."
Civility can bring the divisions?
After a campaign marked by the invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders of Congress has produced no breakthrough on the major issues that must be dealt with during the session of the "lame duck."
But of course, there are at least a polite discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points. Vacuum rating point supporter.
The public meeting Wednesday of the Committee on the president's deficit was equally civilised, despite the political differences between the States.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation arrived.
The two parties are now in a trial period and tested mutual for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants have unveiled a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change of climate which has existed in the past two years.
It is taxation, spending, health care or the rights, the two parties to miles of distance.
However, the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now at the side of the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are causing partisan passions and, secondly, they are estomptent.
This is good. "
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck," Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
The two sides to find a way to preserve some or all, of a permanent or temporary.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not least because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing the unemployment benefits to workers without jobs.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, saying that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session "blade duck ménera does not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112 th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be made, the psychology in the short term will return to the confrontations," he said.
Wehner has also expressed scepticism widely shared that civility would lead to a genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, at-il said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters at the tea who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee on the deficit which include reform of the tax code and to increase certain taxes, to raise the retirement age and reduce spending.
The co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, by themselves, imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have struggled to reach this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that there is on tax issues, at least today, little or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides for two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan battles, given that the Republicans assail Obama on budget, tax and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is demonstrated that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will look carefully observing the public reaction.
Those who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But this would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990 s and there seems to be more ideological splits between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, the two parties activists see 2010 as a mere prelude to an election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that still divide.
The American documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and until the Kremlin part of bribes and money of protection, reported the United States Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service enormous racketeering that helps to explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its money snakes to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was mailed Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared up.
It was drafted while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little evidence of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won a libel case on these charges.
In September, he said in a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "it is crazy, it is to throw, that is nonsense."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in a debriefing embassy; and it is incredible that this would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people in the name of "dysfunctional" and to say that the government was working as a kleptocracy that a government, "according to the notes of the embassy.
"The criminal elements have a" krysha " (a term used in the criminal world / the mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal underworld of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB and MVD, the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a gap in some areas where the city does not provide some services."
The report indicates that the FSB is handling the money of the largest companies and that the police target small.
A source, he said, "explained that business owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the FSB and MVD (rather than organized crime groups), not only because they have more weapons, more resources and more power than the criminal groups but they are also protected by the law."
"That is why the application of protection by criminal gangs is not as high."
The note said that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly addressed the fight against corruption but he admitted the little progress.
The note of the Embassy reports of men who bring suitcases, probably commercial-operation money, until the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank" Indem of Moscow.
"But it is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would rise, the scale of Russia as a whole, to more than $300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154 th in a recent survey on the perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least more corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the US Embassy, which was carried out yesterday, late in the evening, hour of Moscow, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to part, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin has suggested that the documents to WikiLeaks could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger to the US diplomats had disclosed in the appellant Batman and Robin bringing Medvedev.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we felt that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to the ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly lighted with low-quality concrete walls warships, the director of secondary school to Anlong Veng spoke of the man who built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here like Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and it was of its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years of age.
Known as "the butcher" for its brutality, when he was the head of the Khmer Rouge commander, remains popular in this isolated former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the loyalty is finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation has allowed victims to respond publicly to people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government has distributed a handbook of high school, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, made its first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the "Duch.."
In this situation, the anxiety has increased among veterans of the Khmer Rouge to Anlong Veng; making the reconciliation efforts and their to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is some resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation is creating divisions within families."
Under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1,7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movements to in December 1998.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ruled the guerrillas from their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990 s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters Khmer Rouge began to make defection to the government, culminating with the capitulated to Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most veterans of the Khmer Rouge have sunk into grinding poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia; and many people are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few officers elite of the Khmer Rouge had their positions of local executives in exchange for tabling the weapons, it is farmers unskilled at low rank and file.
"These people have benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang Centre for justice and reconciliation which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibés agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been bred in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
SOR Lim, 55 -year-old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving in 1998 as poor--but rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, start the trial of Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the court is to judge the senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes but has not said if he went beyond these four cases.
More may be needed to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation have turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970 s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of workers forced would have died.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem Langdon labour field near her wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun throwing long shadows on the grass parched, Im Chaem refused to discuss his role in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she says, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peace and stable," there said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has done defection of the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would happen if the court had several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, at-il said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in terms Khmer is to connect the pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A history of Democratic Kampuchea regime, consisting of 75 pages."
It has distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Department of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people Anlong Veng know only a few details on the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the city to the regime.
Valeak Touch, 19 -year-old student at the high school Anlong Veng, said that the new manual helping students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are suspicious because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, "said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, at-il said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here.
In the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and full of plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of corrugated rouillée.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31 -year-old saleswoman mobile phone roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk towards the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing the chance.
Belarus to abandon its stock of uranium for weapons purposes
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; this décison is part of a surprise victory in the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met by the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials have told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre of Belarus.
This has opened the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of about £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organised at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear security Summit of 2012 nuclear security Summit."
"It proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group of promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant step," by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George w. Bush.
At the time of the summit on nuclear security summit, the president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would agree to its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially of uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"It is our product... We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"We will use it for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium of Belarus, in October, has been particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was posted on a special train which has travelled more than 1 300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was conducted by plane, officials said.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Coordination and organization, have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy Reduction of the world.
According to estimates by the Centre for the Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpile by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States are strained for years, mainly due to the harsh crackdown by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcomimg progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has no objection to the CIA flights
The government has no objection to the CIA flights with the Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo leadership through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the United States in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks daily El País, who noted that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Commission is informed Spanish for "pouvoir' demonstrate that they have a proper vigilance on foreigners who crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, has been a meeting between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President has acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection to the flights of intelligence by the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid the "taken," "says Aguirre in a cable.
The Department of the Ministry of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Executive Spanish "wanted to give this matter as low as possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
In turn, in January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González was sent to the Embassy that it did not block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any element, no sensitive information," said the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States have shown their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors German" more than for information déclassifiée of INF o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the investigational independent complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between the Governments," regret Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internes, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence and what they consider appropriate," he gave instructions to his staff "to avoid the comments of hot rhetoric, trying to rebaisser temperature."
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of its general orientation, our experience suggests that PP certainly stands to gain from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those révélations-là have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," her.
The parricide pre-surge confessions complained of the "bored" to be mother
The girl spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.

When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to sound out of the labour market, the small stayed with her partner, who has even with a week to Palma.
But according to the content of its communications means that their idyll was broken, they are separated.
In March of 2008 at Minorca, only, and writing: "Alberto is very strange and offended by the fact that I've come to work."
"When I had told him, it was a good thing, but of course, it is now, which means be with the child all day and do not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she speaks of a message of mobile that she had just received: "I want you to rentres this month or you give me an e-mail address for you send the child."
Ella complains: "If this is not, he should leave the kid with my mother, and I take when I," allègue-t-elle.
In May, she speaks of the returned to his village: "This week I'm leaving, but I shall only until 19, because the 20 I have come to work so as not to lose."
She explained that if everything was, it would have taken his eldest with it.
"It will remain with the correct person, is with me, and I will never leave my life with another person if the person is not my mother," intention dubious, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there is another post.
When the attack, it is assumed that the child, who came to the island on the 1 th of that month, and he had supposedly been murdered on 10, died.
"Caesar is happy to one side, but it is not another."

"Terror to the Galician (épigraphe) ."
The last man who has lived with it, relevant, says his regret to feel guilty.

The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the SGP loses 9
With the results of the 18 -N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members in the Catalan autonomous elections, the PP has already targeted the general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, because the number of votes that this is in these comices double normally receives in Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan obtained 610.473 votes to 2008, while the autonomous in 2006, they were promised in 316.222.
On Sunday, the CPP has obtained 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, while a diversion of votes of the SGP and the retention of the electorate of the PP, analysts have calculated that, if there is a general elections, the CPP could increased from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CiU would also four (it now has 10) and SGP would lose no more and no less than 9 Members (it has 25).
These calcules would see that the Catalan is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while COLI would keep a Member or would gain a.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the more next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the comices municipal, where the popular May also be crucial to the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their heads of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations who manipulates the higher budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that CCS could lose town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would get the majority either the opportunity to use their traditional partners, and ERC COLI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it is not fanciful that it loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, and Tarragona Lérida.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have governed with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
To Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to CSP, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
The popular recorded progress in other municipes important as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments to Catalonia and aspires to lists in a maximum number of localities.
The cell Catalan has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there have been three
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian prisoners by agents of the Information Commissioner General of Police Barcelona drew a jihadist cell, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaeda, "for the Liberation of the Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the perpetrator of the Mumbai terrorist attacks which killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internes has given great importance to these investigations, ensure that with "Operation Kampai" has been "stupidity" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which she has been active in Catalonia, has sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the galaxy criminal Al Qaeda for its "fighters" to cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell dismantled is the only that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations have participated, partner--for services Thai, other police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days blows similar to that on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (it has detained the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Mohammad Iftikhar Ahmad Khan, Saddique Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand has been another, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was the leaders since Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The network Catalan - part of which was hit in 2009 - was stealing mostly tourists passports which meet the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front."
It made the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without visas estampées.
The investigators noted that so far has found no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Mumbai, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receivers of stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, we must remember that a few days before that this attack is committed, of Catalonia has sent through an agency transfers of a few thousand dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that have been used after by the so-called integrative "commando" that killed 106 people.
The Police grabbed a lot of documentation.
PP Mas request that it suspend the complicity tax
The leader of EIP, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to Artur Mas conditions to support his nomination as chairman of the stretch, similar to those outlined during the campaign and which is to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-souverainistes adventures as is the complicity economic that the nationalist leader wants to talk about half of its mandate.
The president of popular Catalan came at a meeting with Artur Mas with the fact of having won 18 Members in the elections on Sunday, more than enough to make love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the training that will the opposition refrain in the station's inauguration.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on the alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support a nomination "should eliminate all speech separatists and independence," and the complicity economic - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converge wishes even in the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their gamble to make you thin the apparatus of an administration autonomique very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax to succession and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will deal from PC, Jordi Comet and Dolors Montserrat.
DSS already met with Joaquim Nadal (SGP), which has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (COLI) and today it will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that their nursing night has killed more than 11 elderly people
The geriatric the Caritat of Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Dilmé Vila, the nurse which has killed at least eleven elderly people was responsible in the meantime, he has worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of the Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the" responsible for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the situation processuelle civic leaders."
And part of the social discrediting the entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the nurses at night, the great threat to the Caritat now takes the form of compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from that day has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight body - former patients of geriatric - care that in many cases no doctor Library organized personally died but, given the age and health of patients, the formality was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied yesterday that situation and noted that "the lack of measures may have been in no time the cause of what happened."
Counsel for the Caritat added that "in this case there is only one index of negligence on the part of any other person that is the accused."
The person already dubbed as the "Angel of Death" has confessed yesterday 11 murders and explained that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and one and a half months later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he has caused the death by injecting a sobre-dose insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of pellets sedated.
The director of the Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access centre for medicine.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been used in six of the nine crimes that nurses, in its desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But the laboratory clarify if Vila do not lying by saying that it has sought for its first victims death less cruel or contrary he burned inside by giving laundry as he has already admitted that he has done with the three women killed in the range 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurses at night, the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greatest and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having committed successfully eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacts abruptly yesterday to the threat of yesterday to Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The of peripheral have closed to the strength and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of ECB yourself and the euro has barely increment, which is a signal anxious.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way he collapses, it will recover, but motivated by fences and very speculative short positions.
The institutional investor takes to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB has told us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and it will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the acquisition plan of public debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all the extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that extends the current liquidity measures "until at least March" and maintain the auction quarterly to unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the program to purchase obligations and even the signal to intensify.
If they do not the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the measures of liquidity, God help us!
As well as during their meeting in May in which they said they did not even consider purchasing obligations and they have collapsé markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought much, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the auction lured to a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5,28% compared to 750 million in 4,81% of the auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal declined 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland we released the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10.000 million short-term and 15.000 potential and they have a deadline until February to private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the next Tuesday, the Government will seek parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are an union and that we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President has had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers approve Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment ring to the gills of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market has suffered the 4.5%, double that the rest of Europe's stock exchanges.
The difference in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the effect of surprise.
Today there is an enchère-clé obligation to three years to be got by Trichet, therefore we hope that this with a strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
Spain to ask a Plan of Assistance would be an auto-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40.000 million in available liquidity, the triple compared to transitant types of very expensive and they cut access to markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, ," the."
Courage, we can get out!
The president of Eulen dispute the Board of Vega Sicilia requested by his son
The storm does not in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, dispute, as it considers "of law," the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, approached by five of seven sons in which they will try to make their majority and grab the management bodies of the holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons David and Jesús María José extended battery legal for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holdings of business services to companies does not seem to be willing to cede in their dispute to be present in the bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of seven sons who were appointed administrators in the shareholders meeting of 18 January this year, the dispute is recorded in the Register of Commerce and companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrat Commercial Number 2 Madrid, has opened up new Pandora tonnerres within the family Álvarez.
The judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta, and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate remedies of his five sons to try, through a processuelle quibbling, clearly committing fraud against the Act and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically zero on January 18," according to its official spokesmen.
This will be the basis for that, once the assembly, is disputed by considering that it is "null and void."
The same players, who maintained a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the judge shall convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a society file-access and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services is seeking the establishment on 51% of the capital, according to the protocols familiar.
This is the question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of protest for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull tructurally entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In a first time, no one has taken account of the options for a new stable that, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the last November, in the last phase of the championship all have bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without discounting the skill as pilot's champion, the German Sebastien Vette, the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 refers to the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn in a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful software simulation process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of the high automobilistique competition.
Appointed PLM, this powerful instrument has been used to create chains assembly factories fabricantes of everyone, stations, of high precision instruments.
The objective is faithfully reproduce, simulate the product or process before the building of a real way, thus avoiding the flaws and avoidable costs.
Plm facilitated the development of cameras of Canon, Sukhoi planes or more famous vehicles Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this instrument computer in its plant in Formula 1 Red Bull to create and execute "in the coming hours, almost in real time," the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables of 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the team of Red Bull work 180 young professionals of high qualifications which, equipped with powerful computer equipment and analyse plan any kind of changes on the speed-enthused.
The leader of Siemens explained that the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all elements of speed-enthused Red Bull except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes may pass from the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves high-tech.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each team of Formula 1 may spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the factory of high technology to create and produce its speed-enthused in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that is happening there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty has 580 people, ci-inclus two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has the benefit of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists hidden, whose activity is invaluable and the fame.
The director of technology plant, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago you could say that the progress of R + D in the case of cars racing were making the 50% of victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15% of the value added.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are gladiators unpredictable."
HP come in two 20 s own shops with local distributors

The North American group has prepared a plan to build 200 points of sale in Europe in 2013, which includes the 20 establishments.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the Barcelona in the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if it has confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM systems has ensured that the philosophy for the location of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The group advises American and the design of the exclusive furniture stores (with products that may be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will take a picture.

Sabadell bet on stealing a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the head delegate of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war's liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of margins of interests, that we will try to offset partially with incréments commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell await capture in three years a million retail customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit during the future three years and to be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will set in motion in 2011 a new master plan which will hold a will labilité of three years.
The objective, in part to survive without the need for government subsidies of FROB, is to win a rating of market by the capture of one million new retail customers - 700.000 if you deducted those who are able to get out of the banque-, its great task, because the bank had ruined more SMEs and companies that the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 individuals and 50.000 companies.
His market to individuals is 3,5%, while the companies it exceeds 10%.
Another 2011 - 2013 plan is the gamble on productivity, or which is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare to set targets and the public, because the financial crisis has caused concern among all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, finalise this year its Blueprint Optima, establishes four years ago, even if the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a year.
Customers who leave escape these savings will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by FIPA, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be a difficult year "and overwhelming."
The executive, in fact, believe that the exit from the crisis in Spain will be "slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, has insisté-t-il.
And even if he thinks that the war's liabilities - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and funds pay for its emissions to get liquidity moving already in the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not tight the tap, but the differentials are highest," acknowledged Guardiola.
BANESTO has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase the committees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The master plan for Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
This is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "will be asked to larger dimensions."
"Next year," assuré-t-il move.
He says that the needs of capital "leadership role" and some financial entity Spanish could enter the red numbers.
And he noted that the FROB can replace the market in the diversion of funds in the case of new recapitalization.
After that Sabadell can survive the closing time of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some bank predict already as a new liquidity crisis.
He noted that it cannot issue, but instead of what happened in June, can obtain short-term financing through rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among pe9014. Htm
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there have been several entities who have ensured that they did not participate in this first phase and reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Confederation of Spanish Caisses Épargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group have Cívica is a second phase, adjustments."
"Most has been completely; it is possible that instead of 17 to go to 13 or 14, but all the major process has been made already under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, which has worked a lot in this operation," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of Dirigeants and Exécutifs of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta argued that the process of concentration "to the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way that it is within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé-t-il.
"The passage of 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much more to be done with Basel," souligné-t-il.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of opinions rather happy about the slowness of the process" which "a lack of sérosité and direction," because "that the Bank of Spain, is that we must meet the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the financial system the most rigorous throughout Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed to people who cast doubt on a "lack of knowledge."
The leader said that given the current economic climate, "we can be very satisfied" with the situation of financial entities and of savings, a system which has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the greatest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has come out well of stress that ECB has in July.
Zapatero and the red line German
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but he establishes the conditions for the entire Union.
The markets have caused a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax cuts for the SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of EUR 426 for helping the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of the 49% of AENA, airport management Barajas and El Prat and 30% of Loteries State.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel on its responsibility to the current crisis.
How are these movements?
It should be noted that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its forthcoming policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And that Germany has a radically new vision of what its future, which shocked with that to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of resistance, in Germany begins to speculate on the three possible out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, even if it sounds of science fiction, with a body of opinion very favourable, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines on countries which contravene the possible suspension of payments, an and extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it's been a long time that it is now, therefore there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany felt that we had to do (plans of fiscal stringency and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci-inclut France, used.
The second Central European countries was when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expresses a clear position, asking the reform of the Treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time to private lenders to bear the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although somewhat watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should see the process of reform of the Union which possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has outlined a red line that it does not think cross.
And she tells us that, even if we must take measures with which it is not be too agree, as of this date, the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 Will see the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries which contravene the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default and, in this case, the private sector will also be a party of costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances positive.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who has chaired the Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The implementation is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what it should not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence happen to us a greater tranquillity.
And we can seize the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and its dual statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it opened the way to the argument that it. To bring order at home.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is, and they do not seem to move.
And among the possibilities that, we cannot exclude that to abandon a monetary zone too chock-full of countries seriously.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that she had warned.
Sport and fraud of law
The game similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion conversation in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink on the anti-sportif nature of such behaviour and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before the match (that their team already earned clearly), the two players have deliberately lost time when they have made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
As well, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players will take the regulatory during the match next match against Auxerre dam and can go ahead without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the discipline of UEFA has punished with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho and different economic players are involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not more frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, Asia, but followed, of the sport.
Some of the debate emerged in the case told is due to the fact that this has had as a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem poster noblemen and honour and that in the past was fined for its players for similar conduct) and the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode to its history of inflated technician histrionique and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions committing fraud of law; because, in fact, they are environmentally actions with the rules of sport, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
A property which includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. There has been no violent game.
Another of these goods that we talk with the game is that the team of players infracteurs benefits in a manner contrary to the team, which is not the case either.
However, the fact paradoxical of the players of Real Madrid is that it is best not to what is normally characterised as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of rules has not been conducted behind closed doors to try to avoid punishment, but their action has tried to be as clear as possible to receive the penalisation of the referee.
They expected and they have gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that the infracteurs receive the mistakes people.
Here it seems necessary that we do not put in a situation of disadvantage to rival and has an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action involves putting their own team with fewer players.
And this is not an useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future.
But it is a long-term benefit, with a degree of ambiguity, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and that, with this action players perform a match and spend in the second round of boxes, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards with a less than in the first round.
So that, climb to the, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part strategic decision-making that promote maximum advantage of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not set up to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of fraud), otherwise they chose the moment in which they are subject to it.
They have made a strategic decision without disrupting the penalty or flee.
Even if the border between genius and fraud is widespread in this opportunity I think that we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way of conveying the Director for the cause.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much as aesthetic.
Offensive offered for the Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the timetable focused this year an avalanche of bookings for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations self-financed by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, when December arrives also pick up the dinner groups before Christmas that continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive te price adjusted to receive the client majority: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To complete complicating accounting, the timing of this year (as on New year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated claims in the week of December 13, with the result so far an avalanche of bookings dinners for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are a lot of companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees do pay for it out of their own pockets.
Any is the economy, they all prices of battle, confirms the president of Gremi of Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how will the holidays this month.
"People much thought before."
"They want to leave but they pay much attention to the price," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a reasonable price and with a good service," he says, and recalls that customers have the tendency to take a level with the crisis, so that the Monday-to-Sunday around EUR 25 has become the largest in the application.
In a survey in various institutions of the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is a genuine requests for this vendredi-là, with the desire to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to, with formulas of EUR 25 to 35.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 schools in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, the Fonda and others), the particularity of timetable has assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," détaillent-ils.
Year Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local, remains optimistic after detected a billing since the second half and, although concentrated, prospects for the Christmas.
Sources of the group indicated that the 18 will also be a day hyper-actif in groups of friends who celebrate in advance feast-days.
Their six menus of group they have added to the noël, with EUR 30 or more famous as budget and the perception of that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as wine Catalan made according to the méthode champenoise - cava.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies call for their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
From the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Divertissement of Barcelona), Vice-President, Enric Gomà, says in the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "lively," even if customers are negotiating maximum ."
This is true, the hope for the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, "he said.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern to the United States
Islamabad product of atomic weapons to "a faster rate than any other country."
The filtrations Wikileaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of United States filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous preoccupation in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the details revealing and tasty that offer on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "decline" and that the unstable Asian country producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make it difficult destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne w. Patterson, shown in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "the proximity of some nuclear installations of the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose rumoured and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials.."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferation-proof and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; lower-priced educational and cultural levels, the extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programmes or missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Ministry of Externes Russian during a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani production of nuclear armas.
A report of the Embassy in May, which describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, said that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also calls in Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, gen. Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clear" to the "Army of Pakistan must do away with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol issued a red alert to track the movements and to Assange.
All the aspects linked to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements of" Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest.
In addition, it is not new, but it datte on 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with the latest filtration for more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the creator of Wikileaks lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 police forces international headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the order to request from Sweden, but he has not made public until yesterday, having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received indication to identify or locate Assange "for his arrest provisionnelle and his extradition."
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a path for the arrest of the body national police must achieve - especially if they have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange.
The movement has outraged lawyers Assange, who yesterday issued a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39 years, has shown itself willing to respond by video-conference questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has sought and obtained the allowed out of Sweden's prosecutor of his case, to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"This appears to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world seeks - and Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange continues to be in a place unknown, but it is silent.
On Monday he gave at an unknown location an interview with the director of the journal Time through Skype, a conversation in which he has called for the resignation of the secretary of state of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they épient at the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he says.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" resignation demand.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should be," déclaré-t-il for CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior responsible for combating terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The trial of the spokesman of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, who from January will chair the Committee National Security in the Lower House has asked the Department of State is studying the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to any person who provide their contributions or assistance."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has the return on his statements after he said that Assange will be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use a plane without crew or something similar."
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-gouverneur of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"In the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be a punishment too nice," déclaré-t-il for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with people at the followers of Carod
The leader will give the party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more diverse and the end of the system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted his liar and that it could not give him headaches that he had with other currents extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will win its critics with an eye that it to shield until the municipal elections.
For a start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 advisers national ERC can decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not in your hand.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain vote to the President, they will be able to do without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he did not consider ratified with half plus one votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would be good.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than put its position of the anti-European, a gesture that is not apply when Puigcercós control the body maxim between the congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of strategic reorientation that management will submit to the voting of the national council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of it to plan the congress for the autumn of 2011, what the leaders see as a fact.
The leader of ERC has confessed that the "chorus" affects the stability and that its objective is that once and for all the organization is able to wash laundry room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if it was done.
And it has listed five, it highlights two.
The first, "reintegrate" the executive for it represents at least 90% of the anti-European, i.e., new figures from the sector proponent of Carod.
The second may be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid to once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it is a reform of statutes that can the achievement of delegates elected by universal suffrage.
The model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team Puigcercós, who has already fought in the last two congress.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 instructed the direction to revise the model assembly in a special congress of the statute.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the tide of recent years did not address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors gunning, the time could be good for the resume and the close forever.

Obama civilian-to-military Twitter in the law in favour students foreigners-illegal
"If you agree with the approval of the Act tracks Act, calls to senators and demande-leur to approve this legislation," Twitté the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is meeting today at the national mobilization to support the Act tracks Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Act tracks Act, calls to senators and demande-leur to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains open a link with a further document asking the public to contact immediately the senators, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican Senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of tax cuts from Bush and government funding to continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 senators, could affect the vote of the Act tracks Act and other projects such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Act tracks Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confidant that once the fiscal problem is resolved will set an agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think that there is a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this problem must be resolved before the end of the fiscal year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he says.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that it would seek a "vote of closing the debate" to the Act tracks Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be passed from next Thursday in the Senate, even if most likely would be the next week.
The Senate version of the team Act or the Act of Rêve American would legalise 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in this country in the last five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the help of a large number of Republicans, in times when organizations partisan organizations project protagonists intense lobbying to secure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority which supports the team Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the team Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between Republicans courted ago, Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator outgoing George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate process--the Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the team Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they said they did not support another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported, John McCain, has not defined its position so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest obstacles Act in the Senate.
With the literature it puts its finger on the head
The second stage of Plaisirs language was a walk in which participants flaunts the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... The nail on the head? That hopes to me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of Plaisirs language, a cycle that famous literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (for the another was dedicated to Sexe in the language, has expliqué-t-elle).
The nail on the head ..." Is an embarrassment," launched the Argentine writer gently to the public, most young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderate by Marisol Shultz and Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text for Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who wants to know what is the "head," it is going from one doctor to another, without a response, only in the same narrative thread.
The infectiologue she convinced: "patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my head."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologue which has cut the breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyste that reveals the mystery: "the wound is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on and I have only been able to know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very interlinked.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with the two.
The Nicaraguan citizens Sergio Ramírez has outlined a delightful narrative that he was entitled to the invention, where the nail on the wound is not nombré but at a given time is discovered.
With overtones of magic realism, he speaks of a famous ensorceleuse was on clouds, return of people who had gone far or réparait virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narrative that turns to talk about America, the great which was from the beginning its own columnists and do well to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of the narratives of capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes who we invented all (writers) made fun of false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but an aitre way we would never have conté the history of America with an imagination that lack of decency."
Nevertheless, has souligné-t-il, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and by the fact good--a with the lie, we no longer know how much of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction peaked.
It is called the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that the story."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table the must on the head.
The Cubaine-portoricaine has put on the great scourge of social violence that his country - and Latin America share - product of trafique disputes and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," indiqué-t-elle, after mention that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction."
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who said "this is on the head of the writer committed."
It considered that in a world which lives in high-speed also concern the intellectual habits and the control of consciences which work to the advantage of dogma, "behind every claim there is a small and not behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must qualify: and nuance means many times put the nail on the head and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he says, by inviting to recapture the sense to write.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the final there were some ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to achieve three times the series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, there are two different styles themselves, marked by their technicians, who find them a sharp contrast with the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the final, it has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not hit the mark and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine has finally console themselves with the coin of sous-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played the final.
The strategist santiste came to its first final as entraineur in the Tournoi Opening of 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he has lost with an overall score of 4 - 2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 it is at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall outcome of 3 - 1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournoi Bicentenaire 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered a setback, because his team has one game equal to 2 - 2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he received an advantage for 3 - 1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players have missed 11 metres and he has suffered the leap of 4 - 3.
Rubén has lost two final with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore it does not have the same fate, he tries to break away from the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he said that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break no statistics, it is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the helmsman when he was asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers a lot of the final last, of which it ensures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee blows in the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which did not worry, because it says in its players: "we never seeks to come to the series of penalties, we are trying to finish in time, but sometimes we have that we prepare, the tournament earlier we were prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to the title in our hands, hands he escaped, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that we have more in this position."
Romano now has the opportunity to be a technician sous-champion and for the first time the glory of the securities.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The space agency of the United States has cited the press to be presenting a discovery that will impact on the research of living in space.
The of the National Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will tomorrow, Thursday, a discovery astrobiologique, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.

The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in ambient hostile seemed uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming human smart as humans if living conditions are improved.
It seems that there is talk of a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, who lives in a narrative that it was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsénique.
In any form, the creature uses the arsénique as a way of life and this capacity suggests that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologistes, if these organizations use the arsénique in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different to the one we know."
The space agency will contact the true scope of discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
At the conference will be the géobiologie Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), under the prospect of its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.

The tourism entrepreneurs regret the foreign tourist accident because of poor conditions of Sánchez Taboada to Mazatlán.
After dark of a foreign tourist at a low point of the roundabout Taboada Sánchez, the tourism sector of Mazatlán has asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites in poor conditions and are planning a bad image of the port.

He said that the poor state of streets and pavements has affected because tourists come to walk and they see the disorder and risk-averted stores close.
"The politicians know that means closing a business one day and they do not know the fortune you lose, they did not work for so long and without proper planning."
The hotel Manguart José Ramón Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist has explained the lack of prevention and maintenance of the Town Hall.
"The municipe must assume its responsibility and prevent it happening again, how to do it, therefore has a preventive maintenance and not only the correction," he says.

IP demand results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CEC, has proposed that Members have the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations which opens.
The sector of Mazatlán seek Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between the parties and the executive government, because Sinaloa is turmoil and with major problems.

The list of expectations that the new so-called integrative Congress government management and with society and the various sectors in need of a responsible and that the same models of spirit of party or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CEC, has proposed that Members have the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations which opens.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they are making pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into farce of carnival of governments and leaders of parliamentary fractions."

14 Suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in the Eastern Townships, Wednesday, in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used in the production of drugs.
"About 750 plants of cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment that were used to production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Sûreté du Québec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including heads Theaterfrauen alleged leaders of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following an investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is information received from the public which has enabled us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the regional survey of the Eastern Townships of the Sûreté du Québec, the police Service of Sherbrooke and the Régie police Memphrémagog, took part in this operation.
Illegal migration will continue without problem
The of conservatives who, according to the government, should address the problem of the vessels responsible for illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties have indicated Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am relying heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would own up to a year anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD immigration, Olivia Chow, has discounted the criticism that his party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take measures against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, C- 35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill conservatives because it is to refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," said Mrs Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians overwhelmingly say that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and which treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," the Minister reacted Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could have brought the country to elections in its rejection.
A Conservative QMI Agency QMI that the government would seek a vote for each Member who oppose is then explained to the electorate.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of new York since January.
The city has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement Tuesday has surprised.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services in Quebec, on 29 October last year, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It does not require more for the critical péquiste public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, described the announcement of "rabbit out of a hat" and "cobbled solution on the corner of a table."
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the result when we will announce, is contente-t-il."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQs, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"Mr Charest insists on not wanting to create this committee of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a committee of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the public.
In of this impasse, it suggests therefore to Quebec to give a special mandate for the Auditor General to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," tranche-t-il.
It also believes that Quebec could give the auditor with the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent heavily-armed is not the only project in the boxes government Charest.
Quebec also requested in Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Sledgehammer, which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently on certain amendments relating to this issue.
During the Spring 2001, affecting the groups say, even if the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa subsequently established on gangsterism.

Dupont partially blamé
The Quebec radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback partial to the Canadian Council standards of broadcasting (non-CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians and vulgar language crude on-air.
The non-CCNR judge that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, representations unduly negative of Haitians and vulgar language which is not to broadcasts during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who have killed, do not have violated the codes on broadcasting.
The non-CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the common Front of social assistance recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the show were inaccurate.
The facilitators must submit information solid rather than misleading.
On suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont estimated that suicide is a gesture of cowardly.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of" Dupont Concert "have touched a delicate matter in a fair and appropriate."
No blame has therefore been.
The last was statements following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a showdown media privately-retained reaction.
The facilitator of CHOI said he had no donation to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that people really needy would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is a representation unduly negative Haitians.
"I have already served my suspension of three days on this."
"My record is free for a year and a half," said the facilitator.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of crude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among other things, announce these decisions once during the prime-time within three days.

"This is the equivalent of the Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stage of Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of its category (80 kg), before losing the final.
"I am defeated was a true pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-final games in the final in their category."
"Then, the winners of each category will face to crown a champion, the King of kung-fu."
450 Million in contracts
Hydro-Québec was awarded $450 million in contracts to firms for the Eastmain- 1 -A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed firms OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Axor which was the most important, that the stewardship of the project, for a total of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called Energy Storage was established in 2004 associated with the choice of going to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Energy Storage lotteries lucrative contract without competitive bidding.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to prices.
"This is the new way of making the collusion and to eliminate competition."
"People, instead of that it of secret, now are open," said yesterday the Member péquiste Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard has raised the issue in the National Assembly because it said difficult to see how the public interest can be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I am beginning to have my trip," she, claiming that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least" that the PQ apologises.
The formula of consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually alliance in time for two or more companies to combine their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The project Eastmain contains a high level of complexity because of the scale of the work.
The project is underway and will continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition act; there have been negotiations.
Also, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in of the génie-conseil investigated the government.
A quick overview of the register of Quebec firms can count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, PAE and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to the same legal person, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energy Storage, the Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay meets dynamics of labour and that Hydro-Québec provides a special since the 70 s."
The leader of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, Power Corporation of James Bay (SEBJ), gave an explanation that has blinking on the fact that the contract of stewardship of the project has been awarded privately.
"If you're going to tender and that there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy Storage is part of a long list of contracts over $50 000 by the convention.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec and SEBJ for the Eastmain- 1 project -A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir 109 contracts génie-conseil granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including laboratories of soil.
PAE has swept 22 contracts, Génivar had 16, 14 and 10 Tecsult Dessau, its participation in Energy stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
449 783 $344, Including the contract to Energy stewardship $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau dropped the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance," before it was more of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer Quebecois very little confidence in the players of sustainable development, but also trademark fair and qualifications écologisantes to guide his choice.
Worse, even if he lives in a world where the media messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, there is a lack of credible information, failure of brake on its commitment, indicates the Baromètre of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased consumption of products so-called socially responsible in 2010, Quebeckers seem to make very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say indeed does not believe the environmental performance of companies like advertising green companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre of responsible consumption of the Sherbrooke University.
Another observation: half of doubt on the reliability of official qualifications secured to the products so-called fair, but also of the credibility of products and brands become as parties involved, says the Baromètre.
In the same vein, the politicians' rhetoric on this issue is taken seriously by only 14,6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this part of the lively consumption by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are well-publicized alleged performance of green products or services that it seeks to put in the hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
Up to 61%, they have also fostered purchases from traders of their neighbourhood and privileged the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Baromètre.
Greener and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint in ensuring the protection of animals.
But his social conscience and ecological seems to remain outside of his car, the special Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated using public transportation or have advocated car-pooling to defend their interests.
Walking and cycling have also been supported by 39,1% of the participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A loan of the state for the redemption of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who were asked to commit financially in the redemption of the complex of cinema eXcentris Corporation Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to work, but to a loan only.
The Development Corporation and the Parallèle, who had expected a donation of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Culture to buy at Daniel Langlois, complex film eXcentris on Boulevard st. Lawrence by restoring full vocation cinéphilique, do not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
The donation rather than expected, the Quebec government proposes a loan, the amount would be below expectations, which could be a viable solution to conditions of competition, at least for the sources from the headquarters of the State.
A first action plan and a request for 12,8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to the Minister st. Pierre by the President of the Development of cultural businesses (provincial), François Macerola, which organises the eXcentris.
It gave him a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal cabinet came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the assumption of the donation of the State should really be ruled out.
The Association of owners of cinemas and cinéparcs Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the state to support the redemption of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance building projects, it has not done for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders called for a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans for ten years, of the cinema in its complex after having financed itself its construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is acute in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to retain its clientele.
The Corporation Angus and the Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini, lead, for their part, a campaign of the private sector, hoping to collect $700 000 to push for the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of three screens, the Parallèle, continues to spread eXcentris films to eXcentris.
The purpose of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Cost-management men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is not known what he and his group think downward proposals.
Lifted the veil on a Canada complexé...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lifted the veil on what the United States see as the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they betray the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are amazed that every Canadian elector did not canada-u. S. Relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government to get its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, plastered on the public yesterday, offer more titbits that substantial content to eat.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in the midst of a federal election campaign, recounting how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the US ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"An inferiority complex Canadian almost inherent is perhaps political leaders to talk about domestic issues of daily life rather than to bring this election on the United States (as in the campaign on free trade of 1988)," he writes.
The United States are therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands even less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
Another expression of this feeling of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, for which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," wrote Mr Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and opposition parties made its survival conditional to the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington image increasingly negative that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC pawn of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the emissions Border, Little Mosque on the prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or the kidnappings for interrogation by the CIA.
Another cable said that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was prepared to accept some prisoners to Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "case by case basis."
At the end of the meeting, written, "he submitted a paper to the Secretary of State for Omar Khadr, a 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
Finally get on the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the head of this mass exodus should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancún a renovation plan lighting domestic, commercial and industrial in 100 countries in order to obtain a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which represents a third of the additional reduction that remains to be done to stabilize the climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is the process of large concrete projects that the United Nations hope to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolise from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by light bulbs fluorescents or, better, by lightbulbs light-emitting diodes (LEDs or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1,8 billion tonnes (gigatonnes) GHG on the planet for illuminating humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global emissions of the cars.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans which should put the global emissions of 53 gigatonnes to 49 gigatonnes.
But it will remove the record of 5 gigatonnes in order to stabilize by 2020 rising to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid it gets out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the remaining 5%, product of the light.
With the light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs to LEDs, this need network-energy twice.
The bulbs fluorescents last on average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new bulbs to LEDs, such as those launched the manufacturing Philips this week - the company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a light bulb is heating, which gives an idea of the economy with a plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new light bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to making very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about the bulbs fluorescents because they contain mercury and eliminate as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the establishment of guidelines.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the light bulb fluocompacte, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States, these plants emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country through this program.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year in purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3,5 power stations whose construction cost him $2,5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire in the nervousness in the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, has called for the publication "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the United Nations. "
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to act responsibly and refrain from any action until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of midnight Wednesday without publish the results, three days after the vote on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS said on television that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS states finally the name of the winner of the run-off between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and the Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council votes "fraudulent" in the north, held by the ex-rebellion New Forces (National Front) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by the National Front in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president to vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints by Gbagbo are adopted by the Constitutional Council.
But opponents of Gbagbo believes that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man who denies any link with the former rebels, has "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go so far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo has blocked the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and to appeal to the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday, was supposed to complete the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country remained split into two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, 38% to 32% - Alassane Ouattara, who has received public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a rate of 9,8% for France (DOM) included in October after 9,9% in September.
Alexander Guérini indicted and placed in detention
Alexander Guérini, 53, leader of the treatment of waste and brother of the president of the General Council of the PS Bouches-du-Rhône, has been indicted and arrested at the house arrest of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent procurement.
Alexander Guérini has been indicted for abuse, embezzlement and of public goods, concealment, active corruption, trading in influence and detention of ammunition, said his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is combative and wishes to explain all the questions that the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to continue for a multitude of heads reprehensible, it is another thing to prove," said to AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the strongman of the Socialist Party in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, through his lawyers, to put the judge before his hearing a memo to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been indicted Wednesday evening and arrested.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than to landfills that he had to manage.
The allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their functioning, there was never known, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director general of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzling public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with ban to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to accordingly."
"The examining magistrate has taken into account in do not deprived of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been charged and released into the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, "said Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Raffin Michel.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general of the cleanliness of Marseilles Provence metropolitan region (MPM), is being prosecuted for "and passive corruption.
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused one for "theft and embezzlement of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission," the other for "complicity of misuse of public funds."
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been charged with "concealment of mismanagement."
Among those who have been faced with Mr Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, arrested recently in a parallel case of procurement fraud relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect its companies have been used to launder money from organised crime.
The survey is conducted within the framework of several JIRS open against X in April 2009 in the wake of anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement, particularly in the waste stream.
A source close to the investigation, the investigations focus mainly on the conditions and operation of a discharge of the Ciotat, which collects the waste Aubagne and some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of the young French researcher Clotilde Reiss, arrested in Iran for "spying," held the opinion in suspense in France, diplomacy, and further deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
The gaze of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace has explained his strategy to the Americans, up to give them advice for the treatment of their own crises "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not had to return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and by the US justice trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place in a harsh light the way the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to promote the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with cases of hostages."
The Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is holding discussions with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals detained in Iran.
"Made of noise," they say, "martelez constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
It must to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more that the Iranians are asking you not to do so."
Because, past the attempts of discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics."
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a tactical Iranian familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He said that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (who will speak on August 16, when she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians to a large sum of money" See- (€230 000).
And he noted that the Elysée Palace anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which "will get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another of some 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison since twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the US call for extradition for an illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, as many observers, questioned this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which finds the clandestine networks Iranian acquisition of the nuclear programme, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, not only been "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but has sought to oppose it.
"There have been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the Attorney-General" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot return to the judicial decision," drift.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "closely monitoring the French intelligence services.
The adviser to the Elysée Palace a phone number, clutching, then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée Palace is sparing no effort, through communiqués and "leaks" in the media, to imply that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a role "important" and "influential" of "Ombudsman."
The Americans are watching this activity without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several press articles reflected the official version française.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the the official media blitz of French."
What is at the heart of both "" expressed gratitude to Mr Assad, wonders Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have really done."
The document focuses on the reasons that led the Elysée Palace into this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," that analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, "which was seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeservedly."
In "exaggerating the role of Syria," Paris "seeks to demonstrate to Syria praised what it can draw by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US Embassy knows of good source.
On August 11, François Richier Workmen: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss falls in France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received at the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role for the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law so-called "Cinderella" which prohibit adolescents to play games online after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"A lot of children were playing these games all night and then difficulties at school and to have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said to AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible to 6 hours of the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, "said responsible.
It will also be available to people who are demanding free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" and newspapers T4008 regularly news related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion world of online games.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber movie, faced with 58 other nations.
Global 2018 - 2022: the Fifa from organizers
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa designates Thursday the organisers of World Cups have 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the influence and lobbying may take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the competition Queen of the Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, IFTDO hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its location in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Heads of Government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of economic issues and policies of the World Cup.
The scenes will last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the Fifa files English, hispano-portugais (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations will not very difficult for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the revelations that led to the suspension of corruption from two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, cradle of football which has hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC has a layer, on Monday, a documentary which points to three senior members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What Fifa discontent and embarrassing officials English, who have engaged in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron.
The head of the government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of JO- 2012.
This intense activity to the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Espagne-Portugal does not lack assets with its stages ready, its expertise (Mondial- 82 in Spain, JO- 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its culture soccer.
But the gloomy economic outlook and financial of the two countries could doucher their ambitions.
Potential retaliation against the British and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are mounting the rating of Russia, become an outsider weight despite the shortcomings of his file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a barely veiled accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"The covers of mud, we are trying to undermine," launched Mr Putin.
For 2022, the US, with the experience of 1994, appear to be the logical favourite.
First global economic power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a head start on Japan and South Korea, who built separately a wonderful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of Mondial- 2026 to China, eagerly welcomed by the Fifa, which would in fact Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has lifted the great game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries have more risk than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (because of the time difference) by European countries, the sinews of war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand was led to believe that he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate to the Elysée Palace is another.
Therefore, the current head of the state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not sit easily with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then we must act as if the doubts always.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, even without him, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that it would take its decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011."
It refers to parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has caused a bit of movement.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far.
The president was also a reminder that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of time.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still for seven and a half years with me," was launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: 'Do not believe that I am not considering the step after. "
His before yesterday do not make it more candidate that the day before; they do not make it less.
If they raise comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the substitution of Ségolène Royal Nicolas Sarkozy to come forward.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS claim in order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidature of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L' Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion of the UMP on this," and immediately reacted cautiously's entourage Prime Minister.
"If it believes the possible defeat, it will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It always going to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the crisis, or at least to announce the arrest of a number of operations unconventional monetary policy which must achèver at the end of the year.
Sovereign debt crisis, the Institute of Frankfurt will probably not be able to afford to be as compelling worsen a situation more tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of the states in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, for example, by increasing its programme of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been more said about its intentions, preferring to indicate that the programme of buying government securities on the secondary market "was" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasuries by the ECB have doubled last week, to nearly 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of securities Irish and Portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market expectations of a further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists did not expect any major change of direction.
If the loan operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still in careprovider unlimited liquidity under conditions and generous for periods from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that to be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it significantly alters its programme."
"Otherwise it would risk further tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A gradual phasing-out announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the market of public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of these obligations to tackle a sluggish market," says Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exposure of European banks to the markets of sovereign debt of the euro zone, the institute emission has no other choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors on the market and act to prevent a runaway yields paid by even the most fragile," has an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are high, the Member will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
The protection of the euro is the price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government backs circles
After a week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little relaxed, yesterday, with the decline in bond rate in 10 years.
A precarious calm.
In a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the presidents of the region have heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable," said that he was then denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the peak of 210 basis points and the price of contracts hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had increased to 263 points, resulting in a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was higher at 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by "the turbulence of the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third economy of the euro area, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In other words, the problem is the lack of growth and tax revenues that, with the risk of not be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts by Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012... So that the budget under consideration in the Senate on 1,3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4,3% of GDP next year (against 3,9 percent forecast by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Hence the rumour of a new collective budget that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," the Economic Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, the Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the short term, in the short or long term, because despite its debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, stitch), the stabilisation efforts to Italy are lower than those required of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi faces a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, whereupon early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would open a period not conducive to the decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of arrangements anti-crisis
Christine Lagarde stressed yesterday in a press conference in Paris: 'Europeans, I believe that it has demonstrated yet again Sunday in the day and night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currencies and monetary zone. "
Although relative, the detente yesterday on the rate of European government bonds has brought into the hands of the governments and the ECB.
But we cannot even talk of a beginning.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it might downgrade the debt of Portugal, the target the most relevant today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems," said economists to Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more that "the time is much slower than the time of the markets."
Aware of this and of the dangers, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis already existing.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers G20.
And also in view of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro zone in the sights of markets (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors extrême-orientaux developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly is preparing the ground.
The first securities of the EFSF are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an US official told the Reuters news agency that the US would support a possible increase of funds raised by a direct engagement additional IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which are to the austerity measures to effect closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to follow a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
The are to avoid asking for international assistance before putting in place their own corrections budget and to decide on the structural reforms needed to restore confidence in the long term.
Finally, the European cape.uwaterloo.ca interact on the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
Mark in Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first proposed the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to call the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading market of the European sovereign debt, consider that an increase of around EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle is: it is the NMWR European financial stabilisation, to date, EUR 60 billion.
A council which is likely to be considered carefully in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange vigilance
The episodes neigeux still lead to difficulties of movement, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and threaten to disrupt certain economic activities.
Legal-counsel departments are now in Orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in vigilance Orange, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Skywatchers France, snow showers supported the north of the Gironde and Charente and snow poorly on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow from 2 to 5 cm, time from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes of Armor, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The episodes neigeux are significant enough to cause difficulties of movement and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Skywatchers France.
In the Côtes of Armor, several have been banned for lorries of 7,5 tonnes, whose Guingamp-Lannion axes and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The movement on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult, according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle in case of need and the movement of some coaches EU-TER has been suspended for the day.
The school transport have been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was proposed on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on the Paris airport Roissy and 10% to Orly because of snow.
The DGAC recommends for air passengers to contact their.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first outlines financial
Since the time that the debate on the modernisation of transport in the Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions from the skies.
In the discussion.
It is in particular 23 billion for the Greater Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start the GSP, the state has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical, that will then to the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the funding of its double loop.
Today, in the first additions.
The Finance Act of 2010, in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax equipment and an increase in the tax offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, ye in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It was: "The product of this tax is 117 million per year."
The second is a realignment of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernise, to increase the product and to affect this increase to the Corporation for Greater Paris."
It would leverage how?
Mystery.
This is not quantified in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of capital will be mobilised by the state and made to the Corporation for Greater Paris as project," we read in the explanatory statement.
Has the GSP, we do not find this system shocking.
"Once we created revenue (the two taxes, night-glasses), we can cover the studies on three years then kick in the 4 billion after, question."
"This will be included in the budget and learned as."
The GSP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This system, in which the 4 billion promised are still on hold, of a parliamentary discussion somewhat turbulent.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revenge and spies in
The WikiLeaks has a dual value.
On the one hand, it is a scandal, a scandal which as scandal that before the hypocrisy which governs relations between the Member states, citizens and the press.
On the other, it promises profound changes at the international level, and suggests a future dominated by the regression.
But in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is the confirmation of the fact that each record by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi are merely repeating what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the profile eerily caricature of Gaddafi was for cabaret artists to SKIT.
The rule that the secret files should be compounds that new already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go into a bookshop on publications esoteric, you will see that each book repeat (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or Rose-Croix) exactly what was written in the past.
And not only because the author of texts occult does not like research novel (or knows where to look for new on the non-existent), but because those dedicated to occultism only believe that they already know, and which confirm what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
For secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy and (or spirit limited) the head of the secret services (or it could be, whatever, editor of Libération), which is as true that what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these matters have done so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any person cultivated already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of states can call or a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few years of representation, turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer of films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy pretending to ignore.
However, the fact of the repeat publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker would capture the most secret of the world's most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
As the scandal not aggravating both in crisis victims that the "torturers."
But the very nature of what happened.
Once, at the time of Orwell could imagine any power as a Big Brother which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The prophecy Orwellian had been completely since, controlling every movement through the telephone, each transaction, the hotel, visited the motorway taken and so on, the citizen became the victim of the eye of the power.
But when it is shown, as it happens, that even the cryptes secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as avenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the option of retaining its own secret can take?
It is true, Georg Simmel said already, that a true secret is a secret vacuum (and secret vacuum can never be unveiled); it is true, too, that know everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret vacuum of secrecy, because in the public domain; but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that the secret of Hillary Clinton were secret means empty docking any power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful?
It is clear that in the future, states can no longer put online no information reserved - that would be to publish on a poster hung up on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Well, it's easy to find out if and when a head of state has shifted in aircraft and approached one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future rules--that private and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who move so quiet in mail coach routes uncontrollable, carriers that learned by heart or, at most, by hiding the written information in the Achilles a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copy in drawers closed to key: basically, the espionage attempt of the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now in crab, I.e. Backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionised communications, the Internet has restored a telegraph on son (telephone).
The video (analogue) had allowed the researchers to explore a cinema film step by step, by going forward and back and see all the secrets of the assembly, but now the CD (digital) do that to jump to chapter by chapter, i.e. By macroportions.
With high-speed trains, from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, andparticipants includes it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and technical communications in the cars on horseback.
A final observation.
Previously, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret embassies.
Now, it is the embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France quick fix its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the promises of funding quickly released (so-called fast start funding or early) made by developed countries.
And the big cobble French are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries are committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7,2 billion euros over three years and France 1,26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has lifted the great game to persuade its partners to the reality of his commitment to the fast start funding: report detailing the activities of its Member States, press conference, a great side event, distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency is valuable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU have reached 2010 2,2 billion euros, which puts it on the right path for the respect of its commitment of $7,2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," to ensure that an additional effort is achieved without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means to "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed, some Member States including France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission regarded as the reference year 2009: the international funding, and it adds 150 million over three years funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen references similar in terms of the year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or the overall level of official development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of support from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminuer), it claims to respect its commitment to funding "new and additional..."
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that lent €1 to €1.
Of course, it is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions which are based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present an euro that will recover as equivalent to an euro that, the more, should be counted as part its commitments that the cost of the loan for the lender countries (the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has a line of reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million in 91,5% of loans (EUR 389,8 million) and 8,5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the document of the EU to check for yourself.
It is the only country of the Union to use if the loan.
Germany by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is €1 to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
In summary, in his fast start funding, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in the time and the reality of the financial effort.
While spending that EUR 36,1 million, it is to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Department of Finance (because it appears that it is Bercy who has done arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give it enough to lend?) And in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The funding early is only a small issue, on the short term, in the context of discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
However, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of funding early.
Firstly, France could announce a change in the way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move the discussions on the issues of long-term finance (another crucial chapter currently): we will not to the question of "additionality" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become progressive on these issues that it is on the other.
The hope is based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary for progress in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10 -year-old consumed in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday of the association Générations Futures (ex- Movement for Rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistical significant value of the low number of samples analyzed, but are showcase the issue dealt with" generally purchased between July and September foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of a decade, in supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and 1,5 litre of water a day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The base is damning: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic and some 37 substances that act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions like the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical individual are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or EP is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain for more than a dozen carcinogenic residues and three proven as carcinogenic and some twenty residue that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The potato, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the study, traces of six chemicals including a fungicide banned in France.
Same thing for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the minced meat, canned tuna, and even the wand of bread and the chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the consideration of the plate plastic used to warm the meals micro-onde was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cocktails" of contaminants "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "faced with the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
