The inflation, in Europe, has veered on the feeding
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro zone, is owed principally has the fast increase of the prices of the feeding.
In November, the rise in prices, in the 13 countries of the euro zone, has been more important in relation to the forecasting, apres a rate of inflation of 2,6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3,1 percent has been recorded, has indicated the office of the statistics of the European Community situated has Luxembourg.
The official forecasting has indicated only 3 percent, has communicated Bloomberg.
Contrary to the central banks American, British and Canadian, the European Central Bank (BCE) has not lowered the rate of guiding intéret saying that the reduction of the intérets, with the growth of the prices of the matieres premieres and the fall of the unemployment rate, would drive has the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The BCE would wish to maintain the rate of inflation below but close to two percent.
According to an analyst, it is the Wrestling 22 for the BCE: "it is needed to dissuade" the inflation in order to not have anymore has to intervene on this subject ulteriorly.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3,3 percent is a record in the course of these twelve dernieres years and in Spain, it has gone back of 3,6 has 4,1.
The inflation in the euro zone has taken off has cause of the fast increase of the prices of the feeding and of the energy.
The quotations of the market has term the cereals have increased of 88 percent and the lesson of the soybean has reached also his value most raised for 1973.
The price of the food oil and of the dairy products has considerably also increased in 2007.
This year, the world price of the oil has increased in 52 percent and, last month, a barrel of black gold coutait nearly 100 dollars.
According to the BCE, in 2008, the rate of inflation will pass of 2,1, this year, has 2,5 percent but, in 2009, it will lower has 1,9.
According to the analysts, the rate of inflation towards 12 months remains around the 3 percent, however, the 3 has 4 next months, the annual average rate will be of 2,1 percent.
In meme time, they expect has what the BCE reduces the guiding rate two times in 2008.
Gallup poll indicates a crisis of the government
Pungent a long stagnation, the number of the partisans of the Fidesz (Alliance of the democratic youths) has increased significantly beginning December. Thus for 2002, it has presently the greatest number of partisans, even though Gallup Poll (Institute of survey) has never noticed a so weak socialist support beforehand, has knowledge 13 percent.
For the fideles voters, the difference would represent, because of the greatest determination of the voters of the opposition, a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of a cinquieme (20 percent) for the MSZP (Left Hungarian socialist).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of the Hungarian democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of the free democrats) are below the threshold of members of parliament: their support is of two percent in the whole population.
On the fideles voters certain to go to vote, the number of the partisans of the two parties has increased in 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued deteriorate in relation to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those that have judged that the economic situation of the country was serious particulierement never so has been raised, it amounts has 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is serious enough.
Pungent the perspectives more optimistic of last spring and summer, the families are again more pessimistic quant has their financiere situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population foresees a worsening and only a dixieme foresees an improvement of the situation.
In last December, 71 percent of the probed people, has to know a majority ever seen during the previous surveys of Gallup Poll, have judged that the Prime Minister made his work rather badly than well.
13 percent of the probed ones trust or much in trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány even though 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust at all to the Prime Minister and 27 percent to the president of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of the thinking society that the dissatisfaction live-has-live of the Prime Minister can etre treated as government without change.
Then qu'apres the riots of last October, 35 percent of the probed ones hoped that the government and the Prime Minister stay in office, presently this rate does not represent only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) esteem that the dress of new elections would be the solution has this situation.
To the question regarding the intention of vote, 60 percent of the probed ones reply that they would probably go to vote and the 20 percent complementary say that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the probed ones would participate probably and 15 percent complementary would participate probably. In accordance with the present intentions, the result of the referendum would not make any doubt.
74 percent of the people would say not to the rights about registration in the superior education, 79 percent would say not to the expenses about consultation and 84 percent would say not to the expenses about stay has the hospital.
While we look uniquely at the memes proportions among the people who have expressed their intention of voting for the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would throw back the introduction of the rights of registration, of the expenses of consultation and of the expenses of stay has the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increasedhis prices of pres of twenty percent
The supermarkets introduced in the commercial tricorner of Budaörs have maintained the average increase of the prices of 16 percent of the derniere year has the difference that this year the rate of the VAT has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (Daily economics)
This year, in the commercial tricorner of Budaörs, the Basket of usual daily Noël has increased also in 16 percent on average, a clearly superior increase of value has a thousand forints was displayed itself in all the supermarkets.
The prices, «which were itself déja flown away» in the department stores of feeding in last December, no more have increased brutally by relation has the previous high base.
Nevertheless, the consumers evidently are shocked by seeing that the articles bought clearly below nine thousand forints the derniere coutent year maintaining more than ten thousand forints.
The daily Basket in the probed supermarkets has exceeded of 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the value most raised of the basket amounted has 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was of 6 800 forints.)
The prices of the Unicum and of the alive fish have remained practically as regards the derniere year, however the prices of the dribble of turkey, of the walnut and of the poppy have strongly increased.
In the stores, the price of the flour and of the bread has followed the data of the KSH (Institute Central des Statistiques) but, at Auchan, one has found bread of a kilo has 139 forints only.
The competition has not lowered the price of the productbelow 200 forints.
It was astonishing to see, also in this supermarket, which the price of the returnable bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, him not coutait therefore only 257 forints the returnable bottle there understood.
Him n'empeche that this year, in term of daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and less expensive Cora.
D'apres our calculations, Cora has increased the price of his daily Basket of 15 percent even though Tesco and Auchan have increased in about 18 and 18 percent them respectively.
Comparing the most expensive basket of the derniere year and the less expensive basket of this year, we notice a gap of 12 percent even though the difference between the less expensive of the derniere year and the most expensive of this year is of 21 percent.
The prices have increased in 1 480 forints on average.
The derniere year, the prices have increased in 1 206 forints on average while knowing that the impact of the increase of the rate of the VAT made itself déja noticed in the prices of Noël of the past year.
This process has made perplexed the business, the supermarkets could not determine visibly what margin to apply on products so much they were incapable of foreseeing the impact of the change in the prices on the consumption.
(If a storekeeper calculates badly the rotation of a product, it chances to lose a big benefit on the adapted margin has the intensity of the business.)
Because of the change in the rate of the VAT, the rise in prices of the daily Basket has evolved of so excessive maniere that the most expensive basket was superior of 1 720 forints has the value of that of 2006 even though the difference between the less expensive baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was superior of 1 630 forints has that of the derniere year and the prices at least expensive have increased of 1 284 forints also.
Approaching the two seasons of Noël, we have noticed a catastrophic increase of the prices, in less than 20 months the prices of the articles of daily consumption have increased in more than 30 percent in the supermarkets.
(This does not confirm inevitably the data of KSH: for some feeding of required premiere, the institute of the statistics has noticed a rise in prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
Such a is the case for example of the flour and of the egg.)
According to the daily Basket of it last, this seems almost absurd since the level of price of it produces, pretty expensive déja the derniere year, has increased of has grief more than 10 percent by relation has the base.
According to the clues, the purveyors of flour occupy a stronger position than the purveyors of eggs because they have succeeded has to make to accept the brutal increase of the prices also by the multinationals.
In the tricorner of commercial gold, the supermarkets are not pitied, they record good years constantly.
D'apres our experiences, the majority of customers does not look anymore at the prices in the three visited supermarkets.
Them achetent everything in quantity, they take the foods of long conservation by palettes.
Wednesday morning important tails have formed to the crates of the three supermarkets because the number of customers has increased brusquely.
Yet, according to our information, the turnover is less important in province, numerous multinationals complain aupres of the societies of survey of not meme not to reach the turnover foreseen, not only for the feeding but also for the articles of lasting consumption.
Numerous hospitals make the economics on the disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused by the incorrect use of the antibiotics principally, have been recorded in the hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of the hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of the medical staff do not help has to block the infections, asserts the doctor in leader of the national Center of the epidemiology.
Numerous hospitals also make the economics on the disinfectants
It is not long an infection MRSA has been diagnosed to the service of traumatology of the hospital János.
The bacterium resistant to the antibiotics has been detected on a hospitalized man continuation has an accident serious.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection hashappened to the meme place.
The casualty of a serious car accident has gone out of the hospital but few apres time it has of the to return to it because of an infection MRSA and, for, the doctors have not been able to make an important operation to him has cause of the bacterium that is in his organism.
Until December 10th of this year, 1 094 infections hospitalieres generated by a multiresisting pathogene agent have been declared to the national Systeme of nosocomial surveillance, has indicated Karolina Böröcz, doctor in leader of the national Center of the epidemiology.
That is to say that it is the number of infections caused by a multiresisting pathogene agent that has really been recorded in the hospitals and for the rest we do not have any information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, in other words by the resistant aureus staphylococcus has the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carrying of the bacterium of the aureus Staphylococcus (HER) in their noses it without an illness.
The caused infections by the HER (such as tonsillitises, tonsillitises, cutaneous infections, traumatic infections) react well to the antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if the antibiotics are used of excessive maniere or inappropriate, the bacterium, which reacts well to the antibiotics, will develop a bacterium pretty resistant to the antibiotics that will proliferate rapidly in the bad hospitalieres conditions.
In the event of bad provisional or extended working of the immune systeme, this bacterium can cause hospitalieres infections serious, such as a traumatic infection or a blood-poisoning, on the aged patients, of small weights or having a weakened organism.
According to the guiding doctor of the hospital János, there is not anything of individual in the infections MRSA, these infections are part of the daily of the hospitals.
Especially the infection must not be mixed up with the epidemic, one does not find MRSA only the or one does not look for them, has said Tibor Nyulasi.
The HER resist to the antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff puts gloves in rubber and masks of protection and we have antibiotics adapted to look after them", has declared Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, the hospitalized patients are examined if they are messengers of MRSA, though the infection can not always etre avoided.
The prélevement of the sample is not has the fashion
The great majority of the infections caused by the MRSA would be able warned etre but the conditions and the present circumstances are not favorable, in the Hungarian hospitals, to warn the development and the proliferation of the multiresistant pathogenes agents, asserts Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection appears especially in the hospitals and in the residences for aged people, the hospitals should control the hospitalized patients and would have to isolate the carrying patients of MRSA immediately.
Though the microbiological prélevement is not has the fashion in the Hungarian hospitals.
It must be known that the national Crate of social insurance does not finance these examinations.
Most of the cases sees on the day if the infection MRSA is only détectable on the patient, has declared the doctor in leader of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has relative rigorous recommendations has the adapted use of the antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian directives also for the recovery of some infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made so that the antibiotic therapy or targeted, in other words the microbiological examinations would owe etre realized afin of empecher the resistance to the medicines but the hospitals do not take always into account.
The realization of the microbiological prélevements is still rarer in the ambulatory care and in the care of base, has communicated Karolina Böröcz.
Numerous hospitals make the economics on the disinfectants
Scientific proofs show that the MRSA proliferent of a patient has another the most often by the intermediary of the medical staff.
Washing itself the hands, of putting gloves and masks of protection, is therefore primordial. Though important gaps are detected in the hospitals also in this domain.
The MRSA proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, because of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient can not always etre isolated.
Furthermore, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too much pres ones of the others even though in term of epidemic, the patients would owe etre moved away ones of the other d'1,5 metres at least.
Unfortunately, we notice also that the hospitals, in situation difficult financiere, save des économies on the disinfectants, they miss d'infirmieres, the patients are numerous, thus the risk of contamination is still bigger, has indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in the hospitals or the preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is weaker of demonstrable maniere or then the proliferation of the pathogene agent can blocked etre.
Governmental project against the MRSA
The treatment of the infection MRSA represents exorbitant expenses for the crates of the social insurance, it is why one fights everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to warn or to reduce the incidence of the MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is efficient and the infections MRSA show a decreasing tendency in England.
The European Center of prevention and of control of the illnesses (ECDC) made appear among his priorities the prevention of the incidence of the multiresistant pathogenes agents (as the MRSA also) as the prevention of the hospitalieres infections caused by these pathogenes agents.

Bulgaria, paradise of the property market of the EU
The evolution of the Bulgarian property market is spectacular, the attention of the whole Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little quoted by the past.
That, or and that achete on this market of the EU that is always the less expensive but that will become rapidly expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Presently, in that property, Bulgaria is unquestionably the target the more in vogue of the Eastern Europe with his apartments of ski and his houses at the edge of the good market sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the edge of the sea, Albéna, the "sands of gold", the "coast of the sun", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more numerous has to search for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik also.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgarie, sooner or later, the central region of the country, has to know Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will awaken also the intéret of the investors and they are as more and more numerous has to buy in the well little expensive corner of Trick.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities also, the surfaces of businesses and of offices promise the highest rate of redemption.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive paradises of golf of Europe and etre thus a priority destination, apres the season of summer and the season of winter, also in the two other seasons of the year.
The investors more vigilant achetent déja in big numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to the analysts, the people buying a building in Bulgaria look in meme for time has to change their life, their fashion of life.
Most of the purchasers are English but others happen from France, from Belgium, from Spain and more and more of Romania.
The Maltese and chypriotes investors are also present. At the edge of the Sea Noire and in the most reputable winter resorts, we meet many Russian purchasers traditionally.
The foreign purchasers divide into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, manager regional of Re/Max Bulgarie.
The people who intend to install themselves achetent of the renovated buildings, has a price varying a thousand euros between 50 and 100, or old dilapidated houses, has an active price of 5 has 15 a thousand euros, which are renovated afterwards.
The criteres are the easy acces and the possibilities of communication, the nearness of a great city, of the stores and in general that of the local doctor.
The deuxieme groups understands the purchasers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is quoted among the 10 premieres destinations of vacations in Germany).
The troisieme groups is compound of commercial investors that achetent in the hope to realize an appreciation has means or has long term.
The price of the buildings of the capital increases constantly because of a more and more strong request.
In the European Union, the property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, these 5 dernieres years, they have increased in 21 percent every year.
The rise in prices immobiliers exceeds mainly the pay rise.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, minister of the environment and of the waters, the meetings of the professionals s'achevent Tuesday, nevertheless, Wednesday, official apres the opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the system of the international climate apres 2012 will continue.
The experts and the politicians arriving of 192 countries of the world will discuss on the Travel Warrant of Bali supposed to define the efforts has to make apres the period of reduction of the programs defined by the protocol of Kyoto up to in 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are led has this subject between the developping countries and the developed countries.
The United States have notified also that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss on numbers exact, however that they were prets has to sign an agreement on the reduction, up to in 2020, of the programs of gas has greenhouse effect of 25 has 40 percent by relation as regards 1990.
Another important subject of the conference is of seeing if the developed countries start, apart from reduction of the programs, has to supply a financiere help and technological to the countries that need.
An agreement has been signed also regarding the help has to provide for the developping countries.
The fund of help defined by the protocol of Kyoto will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members probably within the framework of the global Fund for the environment of the UN (GEF), has communicated Piac és Benefit (Market and Benefit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, minister of the environment and of the waters, confirms the ambition of the EU of keeping his role of flagship in the aiming global efforts has to protect the climate and has to encourage the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister has explained that the EU started has to reduce before 2020 his programs of gas has greenhouse effect of 20 percent in relation to the level reached in 1990, independently of the success of the signature of the «agreement of apres 2012», and it was prete has to reduce them up to has 30 percent if the other great regions of the world and/or the developping countries were prets also has to take adapted commitments has their responsibility and has their capacities.
Gábor Fodor has reminded that in 1997, the signatory countries of the protocol of Kyoto had aimed altogether at a reduction of 5,2 percent and the unity of the 15 members of the EU of this time has taken the commitment on 8 percent in less.
Hungary has taken the commitment of reducing the programs of gas has greenhouse effect of 6 percent by relation as regards the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fill his commitment, reminds the press release of the Ministere of the environment.
The stake is big has Bali because the international agreement has long term on the climatic policy owes etre set up in the space of two years, otherwise the application of the agreement probably would be rejected apres 2012. In that case, the commitments of reduction below the values foreseen in the protocol of Kyoto would not be followed immediately of a new international systeme of reduction of the programs of which the necessity has been underlined in the new relation of IPCC, international scientific body, that has obtained the price Nobel of the peace of the UN, loaded with taking care of the climatic change.
The reduction of the programs of it would be delayed and the increase of the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 celcius degrees would not be able anymore avoided etre that, according to the scientists, would have serious and irrevocable extremement consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
The unity of the British army communicates recordings realized during his operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan with the aim of making oneself popular, on the site of sharing of videos.
First, it is the British aerial strength (RAF) that has been fascinated by YouTube: the special unity intervening in Afghanistan assigns the video sequences on the operations led against the talibans since March 2006, has announced the BBC.
These recordings, busy has the help of miniature cameras organized on the helmet, are controlled to the headquarters of the operations of the aerial strength has Kandahar and afterwards they are transferred has London or the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
The soldiers of the aerial strength have past déja 139 sequences on the net one by this way and their "chain" has been looked at by more than 75 a thousand people.
The ministere of the British defense has been with it in line under the name of "defenceheadquarters" at the spring 2007 and it communicates videos on the operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan then that the ministere of the Commonwealth (Commonwealth Office) and the international strengths of maintenance of the peace in Iraq (MNFI) have also their specificity chains on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the aerial strength, the videos have been passed on the net one to recruit. According to the ministere of the defense, they served also has to make to experience the real objectives of the presence of the army to the general public has the foreign country.
The propaganda published by this way not coute virtually nothing in relation to the past usual advertisements of recruitment has the television, has communicated has the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defense. On the other hand, it carries as unavoidably a political message since it justifies under a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
The American ones have made a game
The army is embetée because, except for the videos composed and censured tidily, amateur videos are passed on the site of sharing that present also, for example, the death of soldiers: in the «official», a bit hypocritical films of propaganda, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fighting.
Moreover, numerous videos were déja spent on the net one presenting the zones of operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan that were realized in real mission, but the British army is carried away for the load of these videos only for few.
The American ones make the recruitment a bit differently using the game of téléchargeable shooting America's Army for free. In this game the player can put directly has the place of the soldiers within the framework of a more or less real simulation.

If the French National Assembly does not adopt the law on the crates of the health, the unions will withdraw immediately the call has the greve.
On the other hand, if the law is voted for, the commissions of greve will meet and will decide on the continuation has to take.
According to the agenda of Monday of the French National Assembly, it is probable that the vote on the law relative to the crates of the health takes place only late the night, indeed the night.
Because of the greve foreseen for Monday, important corks are foreseen in the circulation: the railroads arreteront the work for an indeterminate duration and in the course of the morning a part of the transport in common has Budapest and more of half of the societies Volán risk of etre arretées.

Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the countryrisk
According to the Division analysis of risk of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in last aout, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary) increases, under several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In his «warning of risk», the society signals that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is déja that« has short term aggressive ethnic confrontations can happen continuation has the worsening of the existent ethnic tension déja between the population gypsy and not gypsy of Hungary».
The institute of research has added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard aiming likely has to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, that explains by one of the main gaps of the Hungarian political actors: «The public actors have passed the relative public debate has the business of the Roms to the representatives of the radical political grouping and extremes that has based a political strategy on the disagreement between those Gypsy and the Hungarians».
Catalan-English English-Catalan Catalan-Spanish Spanish-Catalan Catalan-French French-Catalan English-French English-German English-Italian English-Russian English-Spanish French-English French-German French-Spanish German-English German-French German-Spanish German-Russian Russian-English Russian-German Spanish-English Spanish-French Spanish-Galician Spanish-German

They remind that, continuation has one bigger given advertisement has the reorganization of the groups Hungarian radicals and right extremes for the autumn 2006, numerous associations have been constituted in Hungary for the summer 2007 giving itself the name of «national association of self-defense».
«Milks him common of these unions is that they defined themselves as a civil organization even though they declare the preparation publicly of their adherent has missions of defense (disasters, Ministry of Defense, defense of the order), armed if it is needed, moreover, evoking the inaptitude of the police, of the army, in other words of the state,» have added.
They have notified that everything happened in accordance with the method that, basing policy and parties on the resentment of the society itself, looks has to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The accent put on the civil caractere and the statute of association does not serve therefore uniquely that has to avoid the legal pieges of the recording from these associations to the court but they constitute also a political strategy.
The analysis notifies that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that increases also the risk in relation to the relationships of neighborhood.
«These last months, numerous neighboring countries quote the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors of some bordering countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy referring has the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region », they haveadded.
According to the institute of research, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phénomene in central Europe of the East, the political risks have increased on the unity in the region.
As they say, the working of the Hungarian Guard looks, for example, has the activity of the Bulgarian national Guard whose constitution has been declared Bulgarian by the national Union (BNU) in aout 2007.
The numerous confusion of Roms that have burst in an area of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are has the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU has decided to constitute a guard saying that the objective of the organization is «the national self-defense».
According to them, these 17 dernieres years, those gypsy «have terrorized» Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, reminds the Political Capital.
They have added that the initiative had aroused lively debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of some organizations of Bulgarian Roms regarding the constitution of their own guard by way of resistance signals the increase of the risk of the ethnic confrontations.
The working of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian national Guard not excluded not that the Hungarian Roms react has the threat of the meme maniere organizing their own self-defense, one can read in the warning of risk of Political Capital.
At the request of information of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, manager of research of Political Capital, has said: the analysis of risk is one of the activities of the institute of research.
As it has said, their analysis of risk is published every year and if events happened that could have an impact on the change in the risk, they inform the public opinion, as in the present case, publishing a warning of risk.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of fete and, around the fetes, reorganizing the ouvrables days whose number will reduce the next year has become ordinary.
Neither the fetes are not regular in the EU and at the UnitedStates.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of national fete and of state as the rest days.
The rest days often are bound has of the religious fetes or has important historical events.
In Hungary, us fetons the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also rest days, the latter all the more so that the réveillonneurs can rest quietly.
Besides, in a year, we have in all eleven fetes marked in red.
On March 15th people are a national fete, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as October 23rd also that is on the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
The 20 aout, us fetons the constitution of our state, 1st May is the fete of the work and the 1st and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and of our died friends.
Moreover, we have two days has Easter, has the Pentecost and hasNoël.
The days of our fetes of state, national or still religious falling seldom towards a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become ordinary to reorganize the ouvrables days in the cases or it remains only an ouvrable day before or apres the fete marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the weekend prolonged working or going has the school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For long years, the minister of the work rules in some particuliere rules on the days of substitution of the preceding days or in accordance with the fetes.
The law spreads for all the employers and for all their used wage earners, on the officials and on the people working in the public service.
It is not worth however for the service companies, the institutions turning without break and in operation, throughout their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, the days of work will be modified uniquely around the fetes of end of year: has to leave from December 24th, the life him arrete practically in the whole country because according to the experiences the majority of people makes rather additional hours or takes vacations that they have saved has these ends to be able to spend the days between Noël and the day of the New Year at their places.
Next year a lot of fetes falls in the middle or has the end of the week, consequently less changes as regards the days in work by relation will be has this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the premiere time around the fete of the work to allow the wage earners to remain four days at their places of being sharpened.
On Saturday, April 25th people will be a day of work to have a rest day on Friday, May 2nd.
Another change is foreseen for October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th people will be a day of work replacing on the Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of year looms under the sign of the fetes because has to leave from December 24th, everybody will have a break nonstop meme if the day of the New Year falls towards a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can embeter terribly the collegues
Courriels that we forget to send innocent lies that annoy us nearly more, of the vocal messages that we never receive: they are things that «embellished» the daily of a workplace.
The question is of knowing if one gets used has this boredom or one releve the challenge and one avoids consciously the ambiguous situations, causing boredom to those ones.
Examples.
«Forgive me, I have forgotten to say about the marketing service that one has called you yourself», tells a collegue to you.
How you have failed an appointment?
At best it is distressed and tries to sort out the things calling the service marketing for their statement that it has forgotten to pass the message (it is the less ordinary solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is sorted out with excuses.
Before having hard explanations, it is useful to think how you will be able to talk about the unpleasant moments has your collegues and of making efforts to avoid them.
You take something that does not belong to you?
It is not nothing more irritating than of wanting to take a file, an office automation tool or the telephone and you do not find them anywhere.

You find by chance lost on the office of your collegue your pen that you believed?
Do not take nothing has your collegues without asking otherwise they have reason of etre angry with you of having swooped down their well.
Not ramene not of envelopes, of post-it in your pocket because it can etre embetant that more are not and that you need immediately.
You chatter of the life deprived of the collegues?
There are not good means for arreter of the potins thatspread.
Who has made that, with whom?
Or and why?
Does not tell has everybody your information (assumptions) on the life deprived of your collegues!
If a collegue shares his personal secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Buries in you the divided information and does not discuss some with your collegues in his meme absence if your collegues know also.
Do you declare yourself ill without fair reason?
While you call the office and you declare yourself ill under the pretense of a harm of tete tearing because you feel badly or you consider to have need of rest this day-her, thinks by the way that your work, your urgent businesses, your missions has term owe etre carried out by somebody of other has your place.
Are not boredom has your collegues!
If you know has the advance that the day after you will not go to work or that something can arrive that would oblige you has to remain to your place, does not forget to warn your leader and your collegues to avoid their being surprised by your absence the day after.
Humming, snigger, phones
You plunge you in your work but does the snigger of your collegues extract some from you brutally?
You have become, without the will, witness to a discussion by telephone that you would better have made of not listening?
Does not disturb your collegues with humming, humming, discussions has high voice (that you menes above their tete), beats of feet, bad languages or expressed dissatisfaction has high voice.
They can disturb meme if your collegues are not plunged into a project (writing, conception, organization).
Do you accuse the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anybody for this neglect!

Do not put comfortable jogging meme if your dutyallows it!
Be not neglected, respects your collegues and you meme dressing yourself correctly, and if your duty requires it putting pretty and elegant vetements, to go to work!
If you want to reply to the waiting, you are not more interesting
One advances sweetly in the usual cork of the morning.
Everything has blow, a particuliere melody makes to itself to hear has the radio: the voice of a violin has that of the electronic effects are associated.
I organize the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones with everything has the hour, afterwards a choral feminine comes to join with it as a true jewel.
Mr2 diffuses the Wings of song Coils of Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us during long with an electronic pop one of good quality.
Yet, now it seems that the cork becomes different if you listen to the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting productions born of the Hungarian numeric underground one begin few has few has to change the picture from unity and, in spite of the new fashion of the rock of garage tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop one proves that it is of the new one under the sun.
Balázs Zságer has arrived of Pécs and he played lui-meme in the group of Yonderboi before he launches on his own way, peut-etre because there is not place for two feet in a meme shoe».
His project (Zagar) and his music, one alloy of jazz, of dancing music electronic and of pop, began has to be made to experience while one has entrusted the composition of the filmed soundtracks to him (p. ex.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The training working initially in small clubs began has etre experienced by one more general public while the magazine wan2 has quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty more important disks of the Hungarian market and has declared Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian tendency who would be as competitive has the west.
Zagar and his unity have become unquestionably «trendy» but nobody has asked them if they wanted to carry well this label.
The group has reacted as it is needed, he has taken out a newand better disk.
The album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, taken out lately, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years has Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the old group of Pécs of BalázsZságer.
We are to it well with the reference to the flight but has side of the aerial music appears maintaining, in accordance with the mind and the tendency of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of the and roll rock.
György Ligeti, singer working presently The Puzzle in England with the group, has shown his talent in these songs during the premiere of the album at the millenarian Park.
On the album, one finds a true tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, diffusing for little of the popular music from the morning to the night, has begun has to introduce the melodies of Wings of Coils recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine therefore (?).
hvg.hu has asked questions has Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me has to ask a question: has your music well remained a music aiming at some coat?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aiming at some coat does not call me big thing.
For me there are two castes in the légere music; not mainstream or underground, not alternate or pop but commercial music and music sincere.
The music themselves calling alternate, underground can etre also mediocre and made uniquely to sell them and to become thus commercial.
Yet, a good pop song can etre sincere also.
The attitude of reception works in this mind also independently of the language or of the frontieres.
hvg.hu: You see a difference between the Hungarian public and foreign, one or the other one more is opened has your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially has the west the légere music has of older traditions.
The, the people go to the concerts and not only the youths of ten or groups of twenty years but also the most aged.
They follow with a lot more attention the changes occurred in the légere music because they think that it makes also part of the culture contemporary.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
You are interested of knowing that, or and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am evidently happy to see that the people come more and more numerous has our concerts.
However we have never made music for the market.
For us the music is not made to reach an objective but it for a reason clarifies.
The role of the public is more important to the concerts or the mutual influence works déja but it is perceived only in the elusive changes in the moment.
Yet, I have noticed that if you wanted to reply to the waiting of the public, you will not be anymore interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
It works alone and has been carriererather has the west.
Zs.B.: We do not follow really his meme path if sometimes some try to take on traces in our music.
We are rather players in team that trust the musical presence of the other one and let it spread out.
Initially, it was well on unavoidable that our music is compared has that of Yonderboi because we are several has to leave his group and has to take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Coilsoccupies the premiere place.
Numerous are those that have heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style have you opened consciously more to a coat wide?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to make a tube to be able to sell thedisk.
This song means more things.
We have wanted it for the final one of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes approached in the whole disk.
hvg.hu: How have you chosen the six singers?
Why they - what was the guiding line?
Zs.B.: The idea was of having a choral of the gospel kind.
We have had the idea to compose that choral of good soloists of the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus was composed the choral one has six members, has knowledge Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, that one has baptized afterwards Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: You have wanted this song like this or have the girls modified it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece existed déja for long in an instrumental version and then when we have composed the album, we have thought that he missed still something has this song.
The continuation of agreements has attracted the voice of thesong.
I have sung the night meme the melody that the girlshave learned later.
I have had it nearly immediately and everything was terriblyspontaneous.
I remember that that has galvanized me has the time but well sure we have had need of the Divas.
With my voice it would not have had the memestrength.
hvg.hu: On the disk and to the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in flat arriere.
There is not solo (has the exception of a brief solo of Judy Jay), they do not have role alone, they sing everyone together and they do not sing more loudly than the music, therefore the music does not make only to accompany their singing.
They were derriere on the scene also.
Is it required?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in flat arriere is of the uniquely has of the technical problemes.
On the other hand, what was voluntary, it is that we have not wanted to distribute roles of soloist.
The song says also that we must forget our ego a bit, to forget who comes of or, that goes or, it is needed just to leave that these wings, the wings of the love, carry us.
I wanted the others to feel also this euphoric state that we have felt when the song is born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs has made you work the more?
Zs.B.: To tell the truth, none as for the process of musical creation, we have had more difficult pieces during the mixture.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play has a piano of concert, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove did not want to work during long, and then, small has small, everything has set up as in a jigsaw.
hvg.hu: Who is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: Ca changes all the time with the concerts and of the fact that I have déja «released» this disk.
At the moment, it is Prophet Is To Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious tradeur has risked billions because of his complex of inferiority
A secretive smuggler.
Thus refers to his antiques used the French giant the general Society, owner of the Czech bank Komerní banka.
The bank has lost because of it close to five billion euros.
Yet it seems rather than Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, besides, can not be considered as incapable at all.
Contrary to all the great houses of bank, it has recognized in time the crisis of the American market of the mortgages.
"It is fragile", have let hear his superiors who have denounced it to the police.
However, if one sticks to the deposition of Kerviel brought in by the French media, of which Hulls It, the transactions of this man have produced in end of last year a profit rising at 1,6 billion euros.
The crisis exceeds the Etats-unis
"All what I wanted, it was to earn money for my bank", it asserts in the deposition.
Last summer, it has succeeded in taking advantage of the American crisis to win a half-billion of euros.
Actually, it has felt the occasionfrom the beginning of the year.
Information have started emerging in February according to which mortgage them said " sub-prime", given to customers to weak income or well to those that had met difficulties of repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not influence on the unity of theeconomics.
Kerviel did not believe in it and he has well bet.
Thus, in end of year, his profits rose at 1,6 billioneuros.
"As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I did not know how to announce it", entrust Kerviel and add that, of course, anything it has not kept for itself."
In the whole cross-examination, he confesses to have distorted the relations not to be detected.
It has succeeded in duping his superiors, although the grant Eurex has started being interested in his transactions.
Who does not risk anything does not have anything
Did he fear to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I considered that the simple fact of having obtained 1,6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
From where does his will of taking so a big risk come?
It has arrived to his post only progressively.
He had just started working by the General Society in 2000 after having finished his studies at the University of Lyons.
His annual salary turned a thousand dollars around 51.
Two years later, he was already assistant of tradeur and, in 2005, it has become independent tradeur with an annual salary of 90 a thousand dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that it would never win so much asthe others.
"From my first maintenance in 2005, I knew that I was well less considered than the others.
With regard to my academic program and of my professional and personal route", has clarified to the investigators Kerviel.
Yet, little after his entry in office, it takesaway his first great success.
Thanks to the actions Allianz, it has won a half-billion of euros betting on the fall of this title during the attacks of London.
And the mechanism was started - he wanted more.
As long as you win, one leaves you in peace
"It was as a snowball effect", he has told to thepolicemen.
But the superiors knew of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they made semblance of closing the eyes."
Yet, it is then that people appear the blow of the beginningof the year.
It loses a billion euros in a day.
To the mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to occult thesum.
Monday, while it arrives to the work, it is not usedanymore of the bank.
Some days after, the announcement bank that it has lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how has one discovered it?
It has become suspicious because of his leave.
"The past year, I have taken only 4 days of leave.
A trader that does not take vacations is a trader that does not want to leave his book to another", ends up Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the occasion of obtaining 365billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government have signed in all nine operational programs with representatives of the European Commission, who would be able, in the years to come, to bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
It is more or less a matter of the half of the whole of the sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns stemming from seven operational programs will be destined for the Czech regions.
The Czech firms will be able to obtain about 100 billion from crowns within the framework of the program Firm and innovation.
The sector of the transports will benefit from the greatest part, up to 150 billion.
The program Transports is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 percent financial means that the Rép. Czech can obtain within the framework of these projects.
This money will be at the origin of a rise of the budget of the national Bottom of the infrastructure of the transports that is going to manage the next year a sum of 90,8 billion crowns.
The Firm program and innovation, intended to the SME and the contractors, must use to obtain financiers from the means to encourage the innovation within the firm.
The firms should obtain financial means for the introduction from new technologies, the research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management more efficient.
Until now, the Rép. Czech was part, among the new members, of the beneficiaries of the funds of THE EU less crowned of success.
The Court has confirmed the grief of 20 years of prison for the ex-president of Nicaragua
The Court of call of Nicaragua has confirmed Thursday the grief of 20 years of prison for the previous president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which it has been sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (close to 1,8 billion crowns).
Yet, later it has been freed and lived assigned to residence in his hacienda close to the capital of Nicaragua.
If the previous leader of this centre-américain State, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again encarcéré is not for the time being, according to the agency AP, not light.
According to the president of the Court of call Ileana Pérez, everything is going to depend now on the agents of prison, or well they will let Aleman finish his grief at his place, or well will go again in prison.
4 years ago, the Court has proved that Alemán moved regularly the money of the government to accounts of foreign societies in Panama.
It was a matter of imaginary societies and the accounts belonged in reality to the members of his family and to his closest partisans.
A part of this money has gone to the funds that Alemán had created in order to finance his election campaign in 2001.
One has adopted the budget
It is thus.
The state budget has been adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget conceived by this government and accepted by the governmental majority without supports it of the opposition.
That for the year underway had passed a year ago thanks to the supports of the Czech socialist party - SSD, since it is the minister Sobotka who had prepared it and SSD could not allow his refusal to itself.
Contrary to the restless debate preceding the vote of the declaration of distrust to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
Parliament has adopted without no problem this law that, well that the most influential, is in a usual way neglected.
This is a sort of paradox.
That one wants it or not, every chapter and every article constitute the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is constituent part of the policy, although occulted behind the competition of being able opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive médiatiquement and it is for that than one agrees him more attention in the media.
The arguments of the politicians interest much more the opinion than the numbers abrupt.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three harm that the present budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first being the important part matched to the expenses of mandates imposed by the law, constituted not only by the retirements, but also by the social loads, adopted the last year by the silent "coalition" gathering the parties SSD and KSM.
The second being a poor economics, consequence of the first harm.
The third obstacle, it, is constituted by the deficit of the public finances, i.e. by the deficit of the cities and of the towns.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
This is public and relatively under control.
The true time bomb, it is the deficit of the cities and of the towns.
Many mayors emitted often, in being stunned, of the obligations, putting their municipalities in debt excessively, in order to obtain, put apart from the money coming from the taxes, from the fiscal rights and from the credits of bank, of new sources of investment.
In the past years, they succeeded in reimbursing these debts by the sale a lot of the actions of the systems of distribution, notably of those of the energy, obtained from the State within the framework of the privatization.
Today, they do not have anymore this souce.
If one sticks uniquely to the official and verifiable facts, one notices that:
Our strut economics already for several years, all as the rest of the world, a stage of growth and SSD does not miss of being windy itself.
Regularizing the public finances was a unique occasion for the successive governments of this party.
Yet, instead of that, they put in debt the State more and more.
Other countries, bets apart from some exceptions as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their businesses in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that people fall mainly on the governments previous.
We are part of the countries that, at the global ladder, are the less threatened by the poverty.
We do not have therefore any need of massive social programs that are itself, precisely these last years, unfortunately uselessly swollen.
Although one has succeeded in removing a part from the absurd populist expenses, approved of the year spent before the elections, if an interval of the age limit for the retirement, as a reform of the system of the retirements will not have place soon, then every policy will stop existing in this country and whoever will be in power, it will make only to administer.
In éxagérant hardly, one can say that the politicians to the power will become bureaucrats distributing méchaniquement the majority about the money imposed between the retirements and the social security benefits.
It is the reason for which the present budget can not be revolutionary, but uniquely he can suspend the mechanism that makes that the ordinary expenses are rejected by the expenses of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion foreseen for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated all the money that they could.
If we do not want really that it happens that the policies to the power become simple bureaucrats, we needs to be patient and to match to this fragile, conscious governmental coalition that the State can spend only the equivalent of what he manages to remove in taxes and in fiscal rights, the quietness necessary for the preparation of new laws of reform.
It is not that these last that will allow reaching progressively a balanced state budget.

The banks want to settle the crisis
The federal Bank of American reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Swiss and Canadian have decided of fighting the crisis of the stock markets together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be put on the money markets by the intermédiare of bids.
It will be a matter for the banks of selling, by a system of bids, the auquels interest rates they are ready to borrow money.
A Titre D'exemple, the American Fed is going to send to the bids 40 billion dollars and, furthermore, it will supply 24 billion to the Central Banks European and Swiss.
It is the first time for the attacks of the 11. September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on an action to this point devised, aiming at preventing, indeed reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This move tends to settle the major problems of the economics, that is to say the increasing lack of free capitals that the banks could lend", writes in his relation to the customers Bernard Baumohl of the society of advice Economic Outlook Group.
"The action devised from the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession at the Etats-unis of 65 percent at about 50 percent", adds Baumohl in his relation.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of the loans not reimbursed, especially at the Etats-unis.
The analysts wait still for other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this move, it is that they must understand really what can be ensuivre still", suggests the economist in leader of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", it adds.
The Central Banks fear that, if the banks themselves will have a difficult access to the loans, they are going to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and would dive the American economics in a recession being able to influence on the economic growth of the whole world.
The Central Banks have made this choice after one has not succeeded in making to lower the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
What meant that the banks always feared the mutual borrowings, although the Central Banks American, Canadian and English have reduced on several occasions, for the autumn, their rates of interests.
"That will have the same effect as a new fall of the rates of interests", says to the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of the society Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of the Central Banks will not contribute to beseech the crisis, since it does not settle the main problem that is the fall from the property market to the US.
The president Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
The global climatic changes are supposed to harm especially the developping countries.
The president Václav Klaus has again given himself an opinion on the problems of the planetary reheating.
The criticism has pounced this time on the international conference of the United Nations on the climatic changes finishing in Bali.
In Vienna, where it has presented his book The planet blue, not green, he has stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, they are not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a mixture curious of representatives of governments and of non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the difference of base that is between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is not that a rocket of words, ersatz of the solutions to the topical problems," has said Klaus.
The Czech president has underlined that his subject has a great importance as it and it is for that that he starts as much for this cause, during the presentation of his book.
Also he has shown his satisfaction of what his book comes out also in German translation, since, it has said, "I meet often only the caricature of my opinions".
Henceforth, the concerned people can read his positions without they being distorted.
Klaus has reminded that nevertheless although it is not climatologue, it has enough moods to write such a book, in his opinion.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and of appreciating scientific treaties, it has the practice of the statistic and he is also economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to it, the next theses: the climate evolves constantly, the changes in this are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all the researchers on the planetary reheating, the effects of the present changes are not either too important or too serious, they do not represent therefore any danger and, finally, the led efforts in order to influence the evolution of the climate are useless, ineffective and expensive inacceptablement.
Accordingly more that having the experience of a totalitarian system, he considers as unacceptable of imposing invérifiées opinions to the others, what it feels as a dangerous attack on the freedom.
In response to the questions of the present people, it explained on several occasions that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environnementalisme that does not take in consideration the relationship between the expenses and the benefit that they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this subject two months before, at the institute Hayek.

Six hundred thousand drivers have let exhale the deadline and have not succeeded in renewing their old driving license of which the validity arrives to expiration in end of year.
We are the last day that the people can still ask for the renewal, so that the authorities are in means of issuing a new license to them before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not have fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, have not renewed their driving license especially those that do not want to drive anymore.
Even though the towns signal a fall of the number of requests for renewal of the license, the authorities in the capital are invaded of requests and the number of requests for renewal of the license has gone growing this week.
The Town Hall satisfies 2000 customers about by day.
There is a tail of a half-hour more or less.
In Prague, close to conductive 140.OOO have not renewed their driving licenses yet.
The release of a new license takes 20 days.
But asking for the release in a deadline shortened of five days is possible.
In that case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
The drivers of vehicle who will not succeed in carrying out the compulsory renewal of the driving license of here the end of the year and will take the road without a valid license, will risk, from the month of January, a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay two thousand crowns to the maximum.
Though, the policeman can also treat the offense having resort to an amicable move.
In the case of an administrative offense, the fine climbs at 2500crowns.
According to old information, was susceptible of a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30.000 crowns.
The Ministry had called the authorities to the moderation and to impose of the fine not going beyond 1000 crowns.
Yet, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of the transports Karel Hanzelka, nobody risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driving license constitutes, according to it, a document of which the people can decide if they wish to have it or not.
It is not as with the identity card that, it, must be valid without exceptions.
The people not wishing to drive anymore should replace their driving license.
It suffices of bringing it or of sending it to thecorresponding municipality.
The driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will stop being valid at the end of the year.
Yet, the drivers of vehicle are also forced to renew other types of driving license progressively.
The people possessing documents dating back to the years 1994 to 2000 have still three years to carry out the renewal.
The validity of the driving licenses issued in the years 2001 to 2004 exhales in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about a matter of 2,6 million otherdocuments.
The Court has reduced the grief of the détectifspactés with Berdych
Police Josef Opava and Petr Koaík, previous marked of connivance with the gang of David Berdych, will be respectively thirteen and ten years of prison.
The superior Court of Prague thus has condemned them definitively reducing their grief respectively of 1 years and of 2 years.
Originally, the détectifs of the Department for the fight against the organized crime risked grief of 14 and of 12 years of prison.
Calling pronocé against the sentence today is not no more possible, only a call to the superior Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also marked in this business, he waits for the moment only for the verdict of first authority.
However, it has already received in other trials of the grief whose sum overtakes 16 years of prison.
It can not receive more.
In January, the regional Court has recognized culprits for participation by hold-ups 19 people, the superior Court treated today the interjections of call of 16 among them.
Most of the accused ones questioned the accusation, from the beginning of the inquiry, maintaining that it was a matter of a handled business.
According to the Court of Law of the central Bohemian, the members of the police, after an agreement between other with Berdych, passed on to the criminals information coming from the police sources, covered the different hold-ups and helped to the members of the gang to avoid the criminal responsibility.
The gang handed over 30 percent of the thief to Opava andKoaík in equivalent.
In the accusation it is question of the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Mainly of the flights to armed hand of which the victims have, in most of the cases, suffered a serious attack to the health, but also of the abuse of power of a public agent and of the banned armament.
During the domicilaires searches, the police, indeed, have discovered pistols illegally held, of the shells with a kernel of steel, a viewfinder for the direct shooting laser or well a submachine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched of tens of millions of crowns.
Put apart from close to twenty men of this trial, the courts already have pleaded guilty of other flights to hand raised Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men of the neighborhood of Berdych are explaining themselves still in front of the court in another trial, some businesses have not yet happened up to the court.
The main audience has avoided, for the time being Tomás Pta and Maros Šulej who live presently placed in possession in Ireland where they wait for the definitive decision regarding their extradition in Czech Republic.
The price of the substitution of the children: 12 million
The lawyer of the disaster-stricken families Igor Veleba wants to obtain from the hospital of Tebí a compensation of 12 million crowns more the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and a million for each of the children.
The hospital proposes a maximum of 200.000 for each of theparents.
It is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondej Dostál is not absolutely agreed with the suggestion of Veleba.
"We refuse such a claim, this is very very high", has said Dostál to the exit of the audience.
"To be in a position to making itself an opinion about the countersuggestion, we need the relation of expert whose opposing party has commanded the writing.
We are going to verify if this has some explanatory value.
But us continue think that the total sum should not overtake hundreds of thousands", has underlined Dostál.
The amount would owe, according to it, to be set between 100.000 and 200.000 K for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the business, the family of Jabloov asked a million crowns for every month that it could not bring up his biological girl.
Veleba has used the relation of expert, written for it by the academic hospital complex in Prague-Motol, as of a document in support of this for the negotiations of the compensation.
According to the experts in psychology and in psychiatry, the parents have suffered a psychological shame and were subject to the stress at different ladders and depths.
The situation of stress has better been borne by the men, although they have been confronted with the remorse of not having known to prevent the substitution of the ones new-borne.
The women, they, remain less serene in front of the experience of the trauma in the topicality and in front of what happens precisely at the moment, has summarized the contents of the relation Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola have been substituted by nurses to the hospital of Tebí on last December 9th.
The past week, the children have returned to their biological parents - Nikola by the ermák at Pibyslavice and Veronika by Libor Bro and Jaroslava Trojanová at Jabloov.
The governor of the region Vysoina Milos Vystril has replaced, end-October, to each of the families 100.000 crown for the repayment expenses occasioned by the mistake of the hospital of Tebí managed by the region.
All the hospitals in Czech Republic are forced by the law at the assurance in civil liability.
In the event of breach, they must draw at heart of reserve, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
Until now the courts pleaded compensations relatively little high, are calculated them according to the pictures were of the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polívka has lost Valasské Království (the Kingdom ofValassko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute about the Valasské království brand (Kingdom of Valassko).
Of after judges it of the regional court of Ostrava, it is indeed it that had used for the first time the King title of Valassko, but the project has been set up by the team around Tomás Harabis, previous colleague of the actor.
Polívka was not present to the audience of today.
Yet, according to his lawyer, the business is probably not finished and his customer will call on.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabis and his team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", has said after the trial the lawyer of Polívka.
According to it, the words Kingdom of Valassko evoke to everybody precisely this actor and clown.
Harabis is from the same opinion.
"There is a work nearly of ten years behind us.
Of research of the money and of development of events" hassuggested.
According to it, it is the money that is the causeof the dispute.
"After years, they have realized that the project is successful and that they could get out from there benefit.
It is them that want to parasitize on our work", it has added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it is Polívka that has used for the first time the valasský král title (King of Valassko) in his televised program.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned it king in 1993.
Yet, at that time, that did not have relation with the project of setting up an imaginary kingdom.
Some years more late, Harabis has come with the idea to make passports of the Valasské Království come out.
Of a humorous action originally he has taken out some a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed of the creation, by Harabis, of the Valasské království society.
In 1997 Polívka has accepted that his name and his signature are quoted in the passport and it has even proposed the holders sales on the price of the visit of his farmhouse and of his shows of theater.
Who is going to sit on the throne?
Today, judges it also has mentioned that Harabis has made only to use the naked idea, published by Polívka in the mané program, at commercial ends.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainemement helped the Valasské království project", has said judges it.
It has added however that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabis and his team that devoted itself to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between the parts today enemies was pursued itself up to in 2000 while Harabis has organized for Polívka an official coronation to Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts have started building up between Polívka has Harabis, which have towered with the deposition "of the king Boleslav 1st elected representative forever".
The leader role in the kingdom has been afterwards, under the inspiration of Harabis, accepted by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka has lodged a complaint against Harabis and his society, request that the court has today thrown back.
It that could pull to the light the business, it is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should take out a new king.
He did not want yet to betray the details and dates it.
"We do not want to go in a fast way in work.
that would be quelquechose as the procession of the kings atSlovácko.
The king would be elected for some time.
Same mister Polívka well evidently can registeritself", has added Harabis.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparition of theprejudices
To tell the truth, I have never been a great fan of thePeugeot 206.
His qualities of rotation were not anything extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the behavior and also that of the fabrication would be able, to many considerations, to be described as inferior to the average.
Yet, presently it is on the market his successor the Peugeot 207 that, it, is clearly better.
Accordingly more that the combi appointed SW still goes a step more far, he does not remain me more than to think better.
While I tested the classical hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained for example about the space for the head on the seats of behind.
Then that there finished the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, to this consideration, comfortably.
Be going to see fact in a fast way
I am going to evoke very rapidly the inside for not not too much torepeat.
It is a matter of a more or less successful design, my only remark dealing with the central tunel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a design a bit more inventive, given that the car seems so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time that one could complain about seats or about too short files is past.
The side guidance has clearly also improved in relation to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase of the dimensions of the bodywork is sensitive there as.
The combi sees disappear also the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
A chest in the chest
The most important on it conveys, it is therefore hissoutte to luggage.
I must evaluate this as very pretty accessible (also thanks to the pivoting ice defers) and of a rather easy stowage.
The blind spaces are provided with elastics of stopping that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not cumbersome and can be stretched everything being capable of having heavy asez from the objects.
But do we stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the pictures, 428 l in the shape of base, what is a rather average number in relation to the competition.
Bet apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, convey the most sold of this category in Czech Republic.
If one compares the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, one notices that the Peugeot remains very approximately behind, the difference being of 52 liters.
While it is a matter of leaving in leave abroad or well of loading a stroller, this number is almost critical.
But if I had to make to bring out the advantages again, I would mention the underbody remaining after the inversion files of the seats back perfectly straight, or well one walk-very low foot.
120 horses distributed on four cylinders
The automobile that we have tested a motor Otto of four cylinders was equipped with a volume of 1,6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, it is to that that should look one 1,6 that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is silent, consume few and, especially, it pusheswell.
If I compare it with the equivalent caused by Škoda that gives often the impression to have a muffler blocked by a serpillère, then I can be only enthusiastic.
Go over the prices
The price of the vehicle is not reasonable by everyone.
However, one must have conscience that one has tested a car well enough equipped, with a spacious inside and a very good motor.
The price of base of a vehicle with a motor Otto 1,4 liters rising in 329 900 K is still acceptable.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900 K, what is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80000 K.
Yet, we have arranged on top of airbags head, of an automatic climatization, automatic d'essuis-glace, of an automatic command of the back windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs all things considered 531 900 K.
They are a lot, but try to add to the price of the additional Fabia the equipment and you will obtain a very similar number.
It remains therefore only to choose thebrand.
The integration of the Slovak students in the britaniques schoolsis worn badly
The number of children originating from the countries of the Eastern Europe in the britaniques schools goes increasing, what provokes by being them of the anxieties about the evolution of the local education.
The integration of the Europeans of the east collides, for the moment, with a series of obstacles.
The britaniques schools notice even cases where conflicts between immigrants and downward of the inhabitants of origin transform themselves into violence.
The case of the Kent of the north, where start increasing the remaining opposing conflicts and immigrants of illustrious Slovak origin well the problem of the integration of the children originating from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicane and the fights between the students are transposed themselves in the relationships between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police have stopped at Chatham a Slovak woman who struck an agé student with an iron bar of ten years.
The culprit defends herself maintaining that the boy had insulted it by rasistes intentions.
The police have also had to intervene with reference to the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The young girls had allegedly addressed this man racist remarks and had thrown him stones.
"When does one mend at home, has a teenager climbed on the stopping of bus and has started spitting us above.
While I have told him to stop, it has replied by apples and pears and then he has discovered his buttocks", has described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are stated by the two parts.
One of the remaining has gone up to qualifying the conflicts with the immigrants of fight for the survival.
The evoked cases higher testify than the atmosphere in the britaniques schools between the inhabitants of origin and the immigrants starts being tightened.
70 a thousand Slovaks come to find work are recorded in Great Britain.
And about 30 a thousand Slovak students frequent the britaniquesschools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the visitors, it is really an island of the freedom.
All what you wait for of your leave can be realized itself if you make a good choice.
Of the gilded and white beaches as the snow, of the high waves or then a sea calms as a pond.
Palms and the inclusive all with waiters offering you a pizza, of the ice or many intoxicating cocktails, on the beach.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the sea of the Caraîbes, you are not going to find this list uniquely in his entirety, but enriched.
Yet, there is only one island on which you will find still much more and they are Cuba, the greatest and the most beautiful island of the Great West Indies.
In times of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb has qualified it as the most beautiful place that the human eye has never seen.
Havana has become the deposit and the place of transfer of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they transported in Europe.
Afterwards has come the American era.
The Hotel Nacional has been erected to the beginning whole of theyears 20'.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who has made it build, since all what was a crime in the US (especially under the prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: the drug, the games of chance, the prostitution.
Parmis his customers, it was, between others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
To the Havana, buildings in height have pushed and of the cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the years 50' of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway has bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, nearly the Havana, and, to Cojímar, it had his yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and of the politicians of the whole America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havane.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, one will mix you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars circulate always to the Havana, since the jigoulis and the formerly imported fiats have already for long, in a so salty and moist climate, rotted.
Although the Havana, especially the oldest part, is approximately decrepit, nullepart elsewhere in the surroundings it is not as much of monuments colonial splendid that there is some precisely over there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that the tourism brings the money if necessary, his development has the green light.
For the last fifteen years, new hotels have pushed not only to the Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and of other.
Cuba proposes still a fantasy that is unique at the world and that will be appreciated especially by the amateurs of small trains.
The cane had fit from the vast plantations in the sugar refineries on a narrow way by small trains to steam and to motor.
Their rolling material has not been renewed during tens of years and it is as one can see in walk of the small locomotives whose contemporaries are not elsewhere uniquely in museums.
To where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors does not miss the most well-known places.
There is not need therefore of writing length on Varadero or wellon the Havana.
Otherwise to remind that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one that loves this writer should not fail the visit.
The valley of Viales to the west of the island constitutes one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exhubérante vegetation grows on a calcium ground.
Mogotes, calcium balls and rocks go up in candle of the bottom of the valley, and, of the fruitful earth having taken itself in their entrails, even his rotted rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where one probably cultivates the Cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the factories of cigars of the Havana.
Somebody will find maybe also interesting that it is there that to been turned the chilien episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old city based few time after the Spanish have colonized the island.
It is the market the business of the slaves and that of the sugar that have brought the glory and the wealth to him.
The wealth has incarnated itself in the beauty and the city-window character of this city of reduced size.
Koloniální spanlská architektura,výrazn ovlivnná pozdjsími francouzskými osadníky, him za tyi staletí tém nezmnila.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the mountainous massif Escambray, is a place to such a point apart that still in the years 50' of the last century, there was not road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation has allowed him to remain aside.
One did not build anything, and it is why one did not demolish anything either, each contented with having a roof above the head.
If one has, at Trinidad, more time than an afternoon, then it is to go to see also interessants places in the surroundings, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of the Sugar Refineries, worth the trouble.
Then, the night, it is from custom of going to the Casa de la Música that livens up after laying it down of the sun and where the music became muffled only at the small morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town situated extremely Is of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is probably influenced already by the path that leads.
The two roads that lead for Guantánamo must overcome high and uneven mountains and cross a landscape nearly without brands of the human activity.
UNESCO has noted down the reef Is of Cuba, thanks to his landscape intact, on the list of the world patrimony.
One produces the best chocolate, to the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in reality, she has seen on the day more or less a hundred years after the journey of Colomb) and from the hill where the old chateau-fort is held and the present hotel El Castillo, one sees several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, of the rum, of the cigars, of the massif mountainous Sierra Maestra, of the Bay of the sows and of the island Isla of Pinos, of the cabaret Tropicana, of the sanctuary of the holy patrone of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, of the Santeria, of the African religions practised by the descendants of the previous slaves, about all that one could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, as one says precisely, it it is worth to see better atime.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, assert the Americans
The lack of soldiers and of necessary equipment influences, according to the Etats-unis, on the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the minister of the defense Robert Gates, the NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as it would owe, has started agreed to Edinburgh in Scotland representing them of the countries that have troops in the south part of the country.
Beside the increasing protest on behalf of the Taliban movement, the eight implied States discuss today also future plans and coordination of the allies.
Even though the Etats-unis have called this week by the intermediary of the minister of the defense Robert Gates the troops of the NATO to a greater activity, Great Britain sees as prioritaire the reinforcement of the authority of the afghan government and the intensification of the help to the development.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but the military power can constitute only a part of the solution.
The being other one of allowing the inhabitants to start up themselves a new development of the economics and of the safety", has said à la chaîne BBC the minister of the britanique defense Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the afghans insurgents is, according to the data of the American army, the most intense of these five last years.
The number of violent actions has increased in 27 percent in relation to the year spent, up to 60 percent in the province Helmand, situated to the south of the country.
The countries of the NATO have about 40 a thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which close to a quarter in the south part.
Yet, according to the Etats-unis, the allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the entrainement of the afghanes troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the period to come, as on the manners how to affect them", has said Gates.
The secretary general of the NATO Jaap of Hoop has taken today after the similar intentions.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have more or less ninety percent of the soldiers and of the equipment that we would need, and that is not enough", has said De Hoop to the agency Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is passive
These last months reign also between the implied countries of the conflicts regarding the question if all the allies make indeed everything in Afghanistan their possible.
For example the Germany has been criticized for hispassivity.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in zones where the violence is minimal, the particularities of fighting of which they are subject are not therefore so rigorous that those in the parts South and Is of the country "where we operate", has said Gates.
The tabloid britanique Sun has described this week the German soldiers of lazy person.
"The" discovered "afghans idlers: the Germans play, while ours fight", has written Sun in a document completed by photos of German soldiers playing at the tenis of table.
The German newspaper Bild has passed to the counter-attack publishing the photo of some britanique troops during a match of rugby in the south part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will heave up itself at a trillion in 2009
The load of a debt of the State exceeding 84.000 crowns is the responsibility to every Czech.
The total debt has gone up, thin September, at 842,7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow this year 159,2 billion crowns.
Thanks to an evolution of the economics of the budget of the State better that predicted, the ministry has reduced the sum foreseen at 152,8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic has gone up around the end of the month of September at 842,7 billion crowns.
For the nine months of this year it has therefore increased in 40,2 billion crowns.
Yet, from the month of June, it has dropped by 13,4 billioncrowns.
Today, the Ministry of the finances has thus confirmed his data on the debt of the State dating back to beginning October.
The load of a debt exceeding 84.000 crowns is theresponsibility to every Czech.
For the whole last year, the State has put itself in debt furthermore of 111 billion crowns.
"For the Moment, it seems that, thanks to a less important deficit foreseen for the next year, one could exceed the border of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be located between 900 billion and" a trillion "crowns", has suggested the analyst of Patria Finance David Marek for the waiter iHNed.cz.
The forecasting of the analyst of Next Finance Vladimír Pikor is similar: "One could overtake a trillion to the current of the year 2009.
The precise date is going to depend on the next budget that one does not know yet.
If it appeared that the situation on the polique scene changed, that the policies were loans to save more, the date could be rejected to 2010.
But I do not wait for this change", it has clarified.
The debts grow
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is mainly generated by the cumulation of the deficits of the budget of the State.
The debt of the State is financed by good ones of the treasure, of the titles of annuity, of the direct borrowings or well for example by borrowings at the European Bank of investments.
The interior indebtedness of the State has increased this year for the moment from 38,5 billion to 719,4 billion of crowns.
The exterior debt of the State has increased this year for the time being of 1,7 billions of crowns at 123,3 billion crowns.
The debt of the State called negotiable has reached at the end of the month of September 803,3 billion crowns and from the month of June it has dropped by 13,7 billion crowns.
The average payability of the debt of the State has risen at 6,5 years.
"The total debt has increased interannuellement of the first to the third quartal of 13 percent, what is, account held the good present health of the economics, a much too high number.
It is interesting that the rise is generated especially by the titles of annuity where it affects 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but across that indicates that matter will be to negotiate while the reform of the retirements will come", has commented on the data Pikora.
Better than what one waited for
It is ensuit of the strategy of the financing and of the management of the debt of the State for the year 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns this year.
Yet, at the beginning of the month of September, thanks to an evolution of the economics of the budget of the State better that predicted, the ministry has reduced the sum foreseen at 152,8 billion crowns.
The sum mainly is constituted by the deficit of the budget of the State that goes in every obviousness ateindre 76 billions of crowns this year, instead of the 91,3 billion initially predicted crowns.
Afterwards, it is a matter of the maximal sources foreseen for the Agency of Czech strengthening, that is to say 13,3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of the retirements, the financing of the titles of annuity of State for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of the borrowings of the European Bank of investments rising to 1,8 billions of crowns.
It compared today with Khartoum in front of a court to have named a bear in plush
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult to the Islam has been condemned Thursday night by a court of Khartoum at 15 days of prison and to the expulsion, has indicated his lawyer.
The British were marked of having let students of 6 to 7 years give the name of Mahomet to a bear in plush even though every representation of the prophet of the Islam is illicit.
It was liable to a grief of whippings.
This British teacher of 54 years in office in the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, has been stopped Sunday at her place and attack to the Islam and of insurrection, in accordance with the article 125 of the Sudanese criminal code, subsequent to several auprés complaints of parents of students of the Ministry has been accused of the Sudanese education.
The history goes back in fact at the month of September, when this teacher asks to his students, agés of 6/7 years, of choosing a name for the bear in plush of the class.
«Eight names take out of the mouth children, of which Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,» tells the manager of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as preferred forename.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common forename in Sudan.
The children afterwards have realized a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed of the legend «My name is Mohamed».
The lui-meme bear did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to the Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teacher in the same school in Sudan, has clarified that it experienced it well and that it would never have made that that it is that can be insulting to a religious faith, «I regret just she having asked the children to vote for a name», it is according to it a matter only of an «innocent mistake».
Opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe it as «very thoughtful to his students» and «who never talks about religion in class».
Let's remind that the forename Mohamed is also the second forename most given in Great Britain, it writes to itself of English in 14 different ways.
This forename often chooses by the Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this forename?
Can one give it for example to a toy?
It is of course a matter of a question of interpretation.
They have not gotten Wednesday to an agreement on the future statute of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.

Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10th.
The Russians, which already have blocked to the Security Council the concession of the independence in Kosovo, insist them on a pursuit of the negotiations beyond this buffer date.
«Russia was and remains committed in favor of a negotiated solution, a solution of compromise,» has said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of onusienne administration of Kosovo, the Western ones consider that the independence under supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina is called ready to declare it unilateral in way if the Security Council does not contrast in his favor.
Belgrade stresses an increased autonomy.
«Unfortunately, no agreement has been «found»», has announced the president of the autonomous authority of the Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel of Baden where took place since Monday these «negotiations of the last luck».

But it has added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade «belonged to a past that has driven to murders and to deportations».
«Effect domino»
The Serbian president Boris Tadic has considered for his part that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade says notably to fear a «domino effect» in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the years 1990.
«For Serbia, it has said, that it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.»
Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted so that every decision brings back exclusively to the Security Council, where his Russian ally has a right of veto.
«The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word»
«Only a solution within the Security Council is satisfactory for Serbia», had declared the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.

They must end as they have begun: to the Security Council.»
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that «the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the statute», adding that every unilateral declaration of independence on behalf of the albanophones would make to itself «in consultation» with the Western ones.

Spectacular repairing on the space station
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and his friends of crew of the international Space Station (ISS) will have needed more than seven hours of work in the space to carry out the spectacular repairing of a solar panel torn, essential to the pursuit of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has amassed the records because of his duration, of his removal from the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, of the tools «fixed» by the astronauts to carry out the repairing.
The problem has appeared Tuesday even though the astronauts had unloaded Discovery the module Harmony of the shuttle, a big cylindrical part loaded with soon receiving the scientific laboratories European and Japanese (to see be framed).
This module is a sort of quay of landing for the modules-laboratories.
But they must be able to be supplied with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore of moving a module of production of electricity by solar panels weighing 17,5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it to post on his final position.
After him to have moved, the crew has started the redeployment of the solar panels of the module that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it is there that one of the signs, which are unfolded as accordions, has been damaged on close to a meter by a cable that has jammed.
The deployment has been stopped not to damage the sign more.
The astronauts, who originally had to carry out an exit of control of the shuttle Discovery, then afterwards to go to repair another solar panel of which the system of rotation was defective, have seen themselves be forced to devote oneself to the damaged sign.
And it is Scott Parazynski that has been chosen to go to caracole at the end of the 30 meters of length of the arm operated by remote control from the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repairing.
It is one of the best «spacewalker» (walker of the space) of theNasa.
Big, resistant, very skillful, it has the very developed chest and long arms.
At 46 years, this doctor of training therefore has been responsible «to operate» the solar panel« casualty ».
After having precisely inspected the damages, it has divided the guilty cable and has installed sorts of «splints» on the damaged zone.
It was helped by a second «spacewalker» remained close to the lock and, of the inside, by the other astronauts of which Peggy Whitson, ordering it of the crew.
The tool that it has used, a minicane of hockey wrapped from insulating material to avoid the electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, has been conceived and «has been fixed» by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation has been finished, Scott Parazynski has waited for the sign to entirely be deployed before making the inventory of his tools and of regaining the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts regain the shuttle Discovery for a return on Earth foreseen Wednesday.

The choice of the statu quo
Suspense will not be, Sunday, at the exit of the ballot boxes: the Russians are going to opt massively for the party of the president Poutine, Russia unie.
Confirming their aspiration to the stability, indeed to the authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Poutine addresses today to the voters a message televised on the public chains, already recorded but of which the contents are kept secret.
It is it as chief candidate of Russia close, the party pro-Kremlin of which the victory looks overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president has not let anything show receiving the foreign ambassadors, contenting themselves with delivering a new load against the West marked of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
«We know the price of a true democracy and wish for honest elections, the most transparent and the most open, of the elections without tears,» it has added.
At the eyes of the opposition, one is far from the account.
It denounces a sullied campaign of pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that «never there have been elections so dirty, even at the time of Eltsine.»
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, the ex-champion of the world of chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned of visit according to his lawyer.
«The Russians have kept the mentality of the sovieticus homosexual»
Behind those legislative without suspense two much more open questions stand out:
- Who will succeed Poutine at the presidency?
The official newspaper has published yesterday the date of the first turn of the presidential one, on March 2nd, 2008; the candidates have until December 23rd to make itself to experience.
Taken up in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Poutine can not aspire to a third consecutive mandate.
Yet no successor emerges.
- What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and at all powerful party Russia united who would choose the government and the president?
Which that it is, to the legislative ones as to the presidential one, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
«The Russians have kept the mentality of the sovieticus homosexual, they do not feel masters of their fate», values the sociologist Lev Goudkov, manager of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the university of State of Saint Petersburg, goes back further: the non-trading company has fallen behind in this country evangelized five centuries after Europe; the first-rate community mind has delayed the training of the individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the years 90, «Poutine has renewed with the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population all the more as this new paternalism has not been followed by the terror, but by some economic ease», values Maria Lipman, from the Foundation Carnegie.
Today the Russians «renounce of fullness liking to the personal responsibility» of which briefly they had shown after the split of the U.S.S.R..
«Why réfléchir?»
The phenomenon affects all the social strata, including the world of the businesses.
And the administrative elite intends to protect the statu quo: 65 governors (on 85 leaders of Russian regions) direct the local lists of Russia unie.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the years 90.
The opinion prefers the stability.
On behalf of what neither will the Russians not vote for the extremists.

Will a rally of end of year in grant be? The experts divided by the crisis of the sub-prime ones.
Except five weeks of the fence of the exercise, the investors rub already the hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional rally of end of year.
However, this year the experts are not so certain as that is going to happen.
Banif believes that "of the statistical viewpoint, the month of December in grant has generally a positive behavior.
However, it does not suit to make forecasting exclusively based on the statistics, since that being given the present context, the uncertainties wait on the markets, at least on the short term".
Although they are not partisan so that the grant gathers speed for the last weeks of the year, these experts make to notice that "the stock market feeds thanks to the existence of liquidity, disposed to invest considering the lack with alternatives with guarantees, especially the permanent income, affected by the effect of escape to values of quality in the long periods as well as in the short ones".
For that, they believe that the grant will have a rather side behavior, not exempt to volatility "especially because one does not know the impact of the probable fall of the rates of the Fed, being given the high level of the brute and the danger of the stimulation of the inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, person in charge of the sales of BPI in Spain, is agreed on the fact that it is not the good moment for statement that it will have as it a rally.
"It is not the best thing", insures the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish scholarship holder clue, has lost close to 4 % since November 8th when the clue has closed points at 15.945,7.
However not all the experts have this so negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16.000 points thanks to the reorganization of the wallets and the traditional contributions to the systems of the retirements that happen every year for these dates.
However, the shade expert that the things will be a bit different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the party of the Constitution (on December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that the volatility will affect the tendency of the market.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst d'Inversis Banco, evaluates that we are close to the levels technical and "it is why we could observe a development of the index that could be caused according to the information that happen of the European Union in what concerns the consequences of the crisis on the market of the credits".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
The analysts are agreed to choose the values that will be the persons in charge to take the Ibex to new maximal overalls.
Solana, of Intermoney, maintains that "this year the great values are back for it".
The expert would include the two great banks and some builders in the wallet "because when the date will approach, the electric sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, d'Inversis Banco assures that the rises will be of the to the bank and to the industry sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the case where they start it.
"ACS since several months recovers positions and we hope that the other builders as Ferrovial and FCC suiveront the same path", explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year owed to the increase of the sales in the season of sales of Noël.
Of another side, the expert believes that the technological firms will also make it very well, well that in that case there is not a lot of representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the seven last years, only during two occasions the month of December has been a bear month.
The authentic rally of end of year has taken place in 2003, exercise during which the stock markets have gone out from the crisis caused by the clearing of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 has recovered 28,17 %, the month of dicembre has recorded a rise of 6,68 %.
One will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of the earnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased in 8,36 % since January) and if it succeeds in computer on his rally of end of year.

Altogether 200 are the banks situated in the most commercial zones of the Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organisms, since it is the first group who is itself determined to start betting on the unbroken opening of his agencies up to 20h30, and to open on the Saturday of 10 hr to 20h30.

He is about to concluding an agreement with the unions to close 75 % of his agencies on the Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decisive so that other organisms adhere or not to this initiative that coincides to the timetables of the businesses.
It is precisely this objective that people search for the Popular Bank.
Attracting the autonomous customers who circulate in these zones to make their purchases in the SME and the businesses of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies introduced on the whole Spain in about 18 months, since it is a matter not of the opening of new agencies but of a renovation of those already existent.
For that, the organism will modernize the branches that it has already in the shopping precincts, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the timetables is accompanied with a conception different from the inside of the branch and of a new design, more present, with more luminous colors.
The commercial person in charge of bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not imply great investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase in six to eight or nine through agency.
The agencies, which will have also spaces so that the SME can meet there, will sell not financial products.
An experience is positive for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested his initiative in threeagencies of Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero explainsit.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, of O Donnell and of the Gran Vía of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with success apparement, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank possesses 2.500 branches presently.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of the immigrants, also with very roomy timetables, which open even on the Sunday and the holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of his agencies have a great fan of not financial products for his sale.
'We do not want to make our customers competition', noticesRivero.
For the time being, they have arrived to an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile telephones, with an external staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in Stock-Exchange of his rival Antena 3
We have arrived there.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the fence of the stock market, when he has noticed that the chain that it leads doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A unique aspect tarnished his joy: 'what hurts to me, it is not' the fact 'that we have increased more but that we have lowered the fact less', it asserted.
However, he has put the accent on the fact that on a weak market, we 'have fallen' less.
Telecinco has finished yesterday the day with a progress of 2,54 %.
These earnings stabilize his loss at 15,66 % fora year.
The value in Stock-Exchange of the firm controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13 % in more) reaches thus the 4.488,88 million euros, according to data of Bloomberg.
His rival Antena 3, who has given up 1,52 % yesterday and who amasses a fall of 40,5 % since January, costs the half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other firms of comunication quoted in Stock-Exchange rises at 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is of the by the way only 'we speak of two similar firms.
The relative fact represents what we are capable of making, on the same market, to what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco has announced the last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass the 1.000 million gross advertising incomes, as has insured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated adviser of Telecinco and of Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertisement of the group.
So that this announced datum is real, the television channel should record for the exercise underway an increase of 3,6 % in his invoicing for the advertisement in relation to the 965,4 million of the exercise of 2006.
For his part, the net invoicing of Antenna 3 has increased in 1,6 % in the nine first months of the exercise (up to reaching the 734,4 million) while the net earnings of the television have increased in 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors that the annalistes point for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Stock-Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the firm presided over by Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100 % of the profit between his shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise of considering for junior 50 %, well that always we have declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be capable of making happy our shareholders, to those to whom already we have given titles with the 33 % of Endemol'.
According to the analysts, the market gives signs of tiredness at themoment.
Lehman Brothers has lately reduced his appraisals of the profits on Telecinco in 2008 at 4 % and in 2009, at 7 %.
That is owed, they explain, to the fall of the predicted growth of the incomes from 10,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and of 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
This same firm has reduced the forecasting of the earnings of Antenna 3 to 4,5 % in 2008 and to 7,5 % in 2009.

Bono accepts to be at the head of the candidacy of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède and to preside over the Conference if they win the elections
The ex-minister of the Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the Government and of the secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède for the next general elections and to be president of the Conference in the case where the socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono it even l have announced during a press conference after the meeting that has taken place this midday to the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The leader of the Executive has justified the offer made to the ex-minister because "it it is important to count on the best" in the political life and Bono "is among the best".
Furthermore, it has underlined that "yes it" seems that the politician of The Sleeve will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Conference if the socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Conference, which the latter has made public on last November 15th his decision of not presenting general elections to the prochainess itself and of abandoning his political career to devote oneself to the fight against the climatic change in the academic frame.
The ex-minister has admitted that the president of the Government has not stopped insisting so that it brings back to the political avant-garde since it abandoned it two years ago.
Furthermore, it has been noticed that, even if the citizens know already who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce the one that will preside over the Conference, in an "act of transparency".
If it affects the post, Bono hopes to transform the Bedroom into "a house of the respect and not of the insult or of the shout" and to make that "it looks more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems pathetically that the unique place of Madrid where one can not speak quietly and quietly is the Conference, the president of the Government to the Senate in some occasions has éte interrupted 26 times".
In the same way, it it has had words of praise as his present president, Manuel Marín and "his knowledge to make" and he has not wanted to make as if it occupied already his post not to fall, as it has made it notice, in what his adversaries could consider as "a domination".
A climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against the climatic change subjects to a persecution without mercy also well the skeptics of his predictions that those that gives priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate a coherence of iron.
It is accordingly more the case for a leader of the movement that is president of the Government as Zapatero and that believes that this fight is more important than that of the Islamist terrorism and who is proposed even of signing one «new contract for the planet».
This approach obliges to him to explain why the action, or the inactivity, of his Government have contributed in a decisive way to what the Spain is protocols of Kyoto at the head of the European Union in the non éxecution.
Who are the persons in charge of the non éxecution, in what sectors it has happened and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Furthermore, it must explain clearly what are the measures that he is going to take to slow down the climatic change to the Spanish.
What firms will be affected, what habits of the citizens will have had to change, what individual and collective energetic economics will be us obliged to make, what economic consequences that it will provoke.
In other words, who will sacrifice itself and whowill pay to save the planet.
But it has not been and no explanations will be.
Precisely because it is a matter of sacrificingitself and of paying.
The measures against the climatic change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of the firms and of the individuals.
Up to to the one hundredth one of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish socialist party so dangerous electoralmente has seemed it to Zapatero that he has hastened to deny it.
That is to say it is a matter of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of every real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, of the commissions, of the committees, of the protocols, of new posts.

The study has been realized thanks to magnetic resonances tomographiques at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and manager of the group responsible for the pictures of neurocognition of the Institute Life&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation happened when the participant replied correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers have observed that when the two people guessed that they received the same one pays, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the copy, the activation was bigger.
I do not know if this conclusion required so much science.
The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years prosecutes implacably the criminals of war of the Balkans from the magistracy of the Criminal Court for the ex-Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with a bitter taste, because the main persons in charge of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8.000 Bosnian Muslims are dead-, the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the serbobosnio ex-leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list his title of which the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not projected in exclusiveness on Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues the criminals in escape and makes pressure on the governments implied so that they narrowed the circle.
What assurance does it suit me?
The self-propelled assurance, which covers the driver in view of possible accidents, implies an important expense that will depend on diverse factors, such as the age, the sex, the seniority of the driving license, the registry office, the type of vehicle to assure or the use that one makes, between others.
Having a car it is the main one.
Are to it that, escoger el seguro of automóvil adecuado are incluso más difícil that elegir el modelo of vehículo.
And it is that, to choose the appropriate self-propelled assurance, is even more difficult than of choosing the model of the vehicle.
The car assurance is an agreement between a company ofassurance and the insurance agent.
This compromise materializes by a contract of assurance, which establishes that the company receives the value of the granted bonus and in exchange it becomes person in charge of the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of accident.
The bonus is the price of the assurance, which settles taking into account diverse factors, such as the age, the sex, the seniority of the driving license, the registry office, the type of vehicle to assure or the usageque one makes some, between others.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, in order to it that more the probability of suffering an accident is raised, more the quotation to pay is high.
It is for this reason that the people of more than 25 years and the women must pay lower bonuses, since the statistics show that these persones have a weaker rate of accidents of the to their caution.
In the same way, using the censuses, the companies have ended up as the married people have tendency to have less accidents than the single drivers.
The use that one makes of the vehicle will influence on the frequency, and therefore on the probability of having an accident.
Increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
They are numerous the variables that the insurance agents have the price in account from the bonus at the moment of establishing.
It is for that, which the driver must well study the situation to choose the self-propelled assurance that adapts the best to his profile.
We will expose the most significant variables here to the moment of choosing one or the other type of assurance, so that this, on top of adapting to the characteristics of the insurance agent, offers him a reasonable price.
The youths of less than 25 years must make in view of diverse drawbacks at the moment of passing a contract with an assurance to an accessible price, as can it to be the weak experience in the behavior and the seniority of the driving license.
Although the ideal to well be assured is an assurance to every risk, other more economic options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for an assurance every risk with frankness, in order to what they obtain the blankets from an assurance to every risk but to a more accessible price.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the accident.
"The part of the amount of the accident that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the bonus, which more will be raised more the amount will be weak", specifies Luis Noguera, the person in charge in Spain of First Europa, online mediator of assurances.
Another option is the assurance to third widened, in order to what the customer assures the protection to make in view of damages caused to thirds, but by for those caused on his own car.
Furthermore, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are minor of 25 years try to be careful and to avoid the accidents as far as possible, since that will affect the improvement, being able to reduce the price of the assurance in future.
An improvement is a reduction of the standard rate that the companypossesses.
On the contrary, a sanction is an increase of the standard rate.
"The improvements and the sanctions will depend on the company and on the benefit of this.
If the company has had a domestic year it will be able to allow to itself of increasing the improvements ", clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the 25 years that becomes easier for the drivers at the moment of passing a contract with an assurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the amassed experience.
It is for this reason that it it is preferable to choose an assurance everything risks with frankness.
"In a normal way the youths can not take advantage of the experience beforehand acquired after an accident", insures the manager of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents happen for the second year of behavior, once passed the 'fear of the novice'.
However, if the customer is married but he does not have still children it it is preferable that he negotiates an assurance to every risk, of the momento that his economic situation allows him it.
The marriages to children are considered by the insurance agents as being the people with the weakest rate of accidents, because the increases will be weaker.
In that case the best assurance would be an assurance to every risk with frankness (being able to be of 300 euros), or an assurance to third widened from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of improvement.
"They have a more relaxed behavior and they have a greater purchasing power to allow itself the luxury of accepting a quantity more important of frankness", judges Luis Noguera.
For the pensioners an assurance to every risk with frankness is preferable (being this of 150 euros), or an asurance to third widened when the insurance agent has a high level of improvement.
It must be said that the self-propelled assurance is something important, not only because does she cover the driver in view of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important spends, it is for that that it it is fundamental to study suitably the assurance that suits us the more according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will look of winning a point in Milan to arrive to the eighth of finale
Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow compare next Tuesday in San Siro to the research of the point that they miss to reach their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the Champions, since it uses to the Italians to be first and to the Scots of classifying itself.
The Italians totalize ten points and they have already described themselves for the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, even though the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it has still need of another point to check that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica that has four, does not pass to him in front.
These two matches of the Group D will happen a week before the sixth day ends, since Milan AC owes to fight for the semifinale of the World Cup of the Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the finale of December 16th.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw to the stadium Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the result most waited for, well that the two teams will try to go out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at their places and the Celtic Glasgow knows that winning it would remain first and would assure a better crossroads to itself in the eighth of finale.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on that since with nine points the games comes back to the Ukrainian ones, which have lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but that have won (2-0) in the other direct dual.
Thus, the milanais ones will try to poison the evening to the Scottish ones, which have good hope to rank as the eighth of finale for the second time in the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the continuations (1-0).
Expecting the victory from the 'rossoneri' the triumph would fall only to the Shakhtar, in the case where the Celtic would lose, to be classified for the eighth of finale to be able to continue the league of the champions of the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, although pursuing the European competition is last and without possibilities, could reach the third place with a victory.
20.000 people attend Vancouver to the first concert of the round of the Spice Girls
The Spice Girls have initiated their first round into Vancouver (Canada), in front of about 20.000 spectators, since the group is dissou itself in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice'(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice'(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice'(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) have declared few time before beginning their concert to the stadium GM Place of Vancouver that the meeting of the group is "gives" glitter.

The meeting and the world round coincide with the launching of a new album that recovers their main successes as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo, that EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls have gone up on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the public that filled the GM Place, even if Victoria had forbidden it some days to him before.

'Sporty Spice' that has left from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who has caused the dissolution of the group two years after, also has expressed his nervousness during one maintenance with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
I was afraid.
I was nervous but I have seen that the feeling of the people has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I have thought why not, I am happy of to have made a decision" has said Chisholm on the meeting of the group that it had dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also has noticed that with the time, "the things have improved and that us us apprecions a lot".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl have paraded for the last time in 1998.

To their arrival at the airport, an army of baby sitter waited forthem.

The new business of gas between Russia and Ukraine throws thealarm.
An argument on the price of the gas ferments between Ukraine and the Russia, increasing thus, the risks of repercussions on the exportations of fuel oil to Europe.
Most of the exportations of Russian gas to the European Union (U.E) are convoyed by gas pipelines, and every canal is scrupulously watched.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of the fuel oil, it will increase the taxes of transit in Russia.
The last year, an altercation between the two, had caused a reduction of the supplies to the countries of the U. E.
The last argument between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the government Ukrainian and Gazprom, society of monopoly of property of the Russia supplying the gas, have tried in vain, of finding an agreement on the cost of the Russian gas supplied in Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom has declared that it would increase as expected, his prizes for Ukraine considering that he has accepted to pay for 2008, up to 50% of more for the supply of gas coming from the Turkmenistan neighbor.
The analysts have declared that that would comprise for the Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of the importation coming from Gazprom.
«It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, reminding that we are a country through which the majority of the gaz,» passes has announced the Ukrainian minister of the Economics, Anatoly Kinkh to the press agency Reuters.
«The fluctuations of the costs of the gas would be no doubt related to our discussions about the taxes of transit (to the Western Europe) via Ukraine»
The last great altercation between Moscow and Kiev has caused in January 2006, the break of the supplies of Gazprom destined for Ukraine.
That has led to the fall of the exportations to the Western Europe, increasing the prices by consequence.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the EuropeanUnion.
Russia possesses the greatest stocks of gas, even if the majority among them are still under developed.
By consequence, Gazprom completes his own supplies with gas coming from Turkmenistan and from other nations of the Soviet ex union in the Central Asia.
The ministry of the health 'must control his foreignemployees'.
The ministry of the Scots health must improve the controls to carry out on his extra-community employees to verify if they have criminal precedents, has declared the committee of control.
The warning of the General Reviser, Robert Black, has occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, the attack was involved to the airport of Glasgow of June.
M. Black has moreover, expressed his worry on the fact that the ministry of the Scots health does not possess any precise datum on the number of people of beside sea that he uses.
His relation has all the same put other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five sanitary authorities, in relief.
The general reviser has made controls on the staff extra-European with reference to the attack of the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years, iraquienne doctor of origin to the service of the Hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, has been stopped at the airport after having darkened with his Jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
It made left of the three doctors that have been filmed to the Old Bailey in October, because suspected of being involved in diverse attempts of explosion of cars in the Close Kingdom.
The ministry of the health will have to carry out controls pre-job on the staff of beside sea, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and allowed of work for the Close Kingdom.
Well that the ministry of the Scots health use the Disclosure Ecossaise to carry out the controls of criminal precedents, the agency does not have any right to obtain such information out of Great Britain.
Among the numerous warnings, the relation of the general reviser declares now that the committees are obliged to confront controls with the Office of control of criminal precedents, allowing thus, to the employers of starting itself on diverse country.
«Although we have discovered that some information regarding the staff have well been verified, that is not made to every time. Announce the relation.
M. Black has declared that the ministry of the Scots health carries out most of the controls pre-job that it would make itself, but also it has added: «Our relation puts in relief aspects where the system can be improved in order to guarantee that of the appropriate information on some members of the staff of beside sea are available to the sanitary services.
M. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland has declared that it is "extremely improbable" that control them pre-job can to identify the employees likely to commit terrorist future acts.
It has declares "the relation suggests that control them pre-job carried out presently, work well in the Scottish sanitary system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish sanitary authorities have declared to use 1161 people of beside sea, constituted for the majority of doctors and nurses.
But the general reviser has underlined that these numbers must probably be revised to the rise, in part because of the problems relative to the identification of the members of the staff endowed with contract at indeterminate duration, who could choose or not, of remaining in our country.
The inquiry has demonstrated that the present procedures of controls of the sanitary authorities at Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are totally appropriate.
These controls are carried out on passport, license of work and qualifications.
The Scottish Government reviews at the moment his policy and his system of controls pre-job for the members of the staff beside ocean of the sanitary service..
The secretary to the Health Nicola Sturgeon has declared: "I was enthusiastic of realizing this work subsequent to the terrorist attack to the airport of Glasgow. »
It has added that the allied Scottish Government to the sanitary committees would consider with care the warnings stated in the relation that should be published next month, and would commit to guaranteeing a better execution of the controls pre-job updated lately, and valid for all the employees, including the people of beside sea.

The climate of Venus could reveal the future of theEarth.
The scientists have yesterday declared that Venus probably has been a planet pleasant to live.
The data stemming from the European vessel in orbit have demonstrated that the planet is two times probably smaller than the Earth, contrary to what one thought beforehand.
Venus is the planet the more close to the Earth.
These two worlds are virtually same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is more close to the Sun.
The scientists believe now that him there of the billion years, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and even could have been habitable.
But the effect grips owed to the dioxide of carbon, the atmospheric erosion dûe to the solar radiations allied to a slower rotation has driven Venus to another whole kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is devastated by hurricanes and storms of lightnings and has a surface of temperature warm enough to melt the lead.
The discoveries of Come Express, the probe of the Spatial Agency European, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth owed to the catastrophic changes in the climate.
The teacher of the department of physics of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of the one Come Express, has declared: «We start understanding the reason why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets in them even are virtually similar.

Still open to everything
Mitt Romney has declared not to be to the height as candidate for the presidency, to reply to the questions of a chap of snow.
In spite of that, the republican candidates for the presidency have finally accepted to participate in the debate of You Tube, during which of numerous ordinary voters having recorded their questions, subject them to the candidates.
Wednesday night 28 November, none of the asked questions has been so ridiculous that that solution of another debate of You Tube, when a chap of snow has asked the democrats for their position in relation to the reheating of the planet.
But this time here, the questions and the replies much have reflected the conditions of the republican party, candidate for the next elections.
One is not known on what criteria, the producers of CNN, who has sponsored the debate, have chosen the clips of You Tube to show the candidates candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest boarding only of one theme, has focused on the immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects the strong ones for the Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to phone while they would hear pleasant things: The state control has raised rises of approval when the candidates expressed themselves in a coarse way.
The exchange the hardest and the longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national forehead, and Mr. Romney who is in mind important elections anticipated from Iowa and from New Hampshire.
M. Giuliani has tried to put the fact that it was accommodating about the secret immigration during his mandate of mayor of New York in relief.
It has attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the ex governor of the Massachusetts, of using secret immigrants at his place.
The two combatants have become particularly ferocious when one has asked them if they would be ready to promote one "amnésia" (offering a regular statute and the possibility of citizen evolution to the secret ones).
Minor candidates as Duncan Hunter, a californien delegate, and Tom Tancredo, a delegate of Colorado, have succeeded in deepening this subject.
None of them has the possibility of being taken up, but everyone two remain in the race, can be grace by the way that they have started fighting the immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In a general way, the candidates, at least regarding the immigration, have the same opinions: of the more rigid borders, and tolerance zero for the secret immigrants.
This subject, ally to the anxieties aroused in particular by the business of the toxic toys produced in China, or well of other fears to the external world, favor the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions of the libertarians and the Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other subjects have been lifted up.
M. Giuliani has asked why it had supported the campaign beforehand for the control of weapons.
John McCain and Mr. Romney have discussed to know if to put water in the nose should be considered as a torture.
One of the participants has asked if the candidates believed in his whole, at the contents of the Bible.
That has driven Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his preferred book, even if it is not on of believing in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another participant has asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
One did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his Christian conservatism of long date - to declare that the death penalty is painful well only necessary.
When one has insisted to know if Jesus would have been in favor, he has started to laugh and has declared that Jesus is too stylish to appear to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The ascent of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious investigations of grants led by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling during the debate of Wednesday.
Those two there are emerged of the emptiness, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party do not manage to start agreed to decide who is the more well-known candidate and more traditionalistic.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and in a convincing way thanks to a message of success on the American size approaching thus the leaders.
This time here, the party is divided and the result is far from beingclear.
The pains of the Labor Party Members
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which to sink; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Considering the tendency of the British scandals, this is not particularly profitable.
Not of sold decorations, nor of bills of Parisian hotel of politicians, not of finger of sucked extra-conjugal foot.
But this is that a revelation vouches that a rich man of business would have concealed for four years, under fake names, his contributions to the present Labor Party, equivalent to more £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle of which Gordon Brown would well have managed without it.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister has made walk back in his project of election, insulting stupidly the British intelligence proclaiming that the opinion polls have not influenced his decision, and that on the contrary he hoped, to offer a dense and efficient government.
On the contrary, such a Vince Cable, the shiny democratic liberal leader, has declared that terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself of Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty at the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a fault of the directives and a mediocre sentence in the event of urgency.
The inadequate suggestions in favor of the change in the code of the taxes have caused a coalition of the industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million staff data on behalf of the authorities of the taxes, has revealed an incredible blunder administrative.
A trio of generals to the retirement have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting defense expenditures against the reductions: they have proclaimed that being minister of the defense is for them, a job part-time.
At the Present Time, the suspicion of fishy settlements on behalf of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary general the Labor Party Members (and his ex leader of the vigilance) have made that they have had to resign.
Nothing of that means that Mr. Brown heads inevitably for theexit.
However the governments can happen at a point where governing would be impossible.
The people do not love the politicians, and do not trust them, but leave in general their doubts of being quoted lors that a new government arrives in power.
It seems evident that a Prime Minister can not improve the things, nor even to govern for long, lors that it risks the suspension: the public administration does not work anymore; the office of the ministers makes the assessment; the press searches for bad histories; and the government becomes on the defensive and without more no objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr. Brown is particularly difficult, because contrary to other leaders talks about politics, it can not pride itself on being a beginner.
Well that he would wish to repudiate Tony Blair, all the same he has been his superior lieutenant.
The problems relative to the Northern Rock and to the data of the taxes for example, are related to the decisions of Mr. Brown made while he was chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if it is directly not involved in the misfortunes of Blair, such the long inquiry on the funds of the party «of the money counting for the members of the House of Lords», the voters could think the opposite.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown incurs is not so tragic as it seems it.
The blunders are not so monstrous as the members of the party of the Tories make it believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is not any victim nor swindle.
And the remedy, although painful, could be of realizing the tendencies Stalinist of Mr. Brown of always, in favor of a reliable and lightly brutal government.
The new scandal on the political settlements is a good example.
M. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compares his settlements with the charity, has declared that he did not wish for any public gratitude of his charity.
It can have his opinion, but deciding is not up toit.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subventionneurs of the politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know that contributes to the success of those that will govern the country.
M. Watt, who has declared to know of the programs of Mr. Abrahams, without knowledge that that was illegal, will owe by consequence to be questioned, similarly moreover that Jon Mendlesohn, the person in charge of the collections of grants who had talked about the dubious settlements in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not implied: Nothing does not let think that he has known of the these moves, most of the payments carried out have been made subsequent to his arrival to the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made the half.
Rapidly it has condemned the legislative fault of his party, but it has not attracted the attention on the fact that the power of decision rests on a thing that him connait well, to make compound resort to a committee of inquiry on this subject from a bishop to the retirement and a judge.
In that case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been scorned, it falls within the competenceof the police.
Besides, there is something else well that Mr. Brown must make, such that to find a permanent president for the independent committee of the Switchboards of public life, without leader since six months, and to prepare a good reform on the financially of the political parties.
That would oblige the Labor Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, what could lead him to renounce his particular financial relation with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a such partisan Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The party of the conservatives has now a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconquer the voters, and the only way of obtaining a victory is of demonstrating an irreproachable integrity and solid abilities.
Swindle of cards.
Would the crisis of the mortgages contaminate the American market of the credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins be kindled, to whirl goshawk.
Maintaining that the market of the American one property crosses a critical stage, the predators aim at the American market of the credit cards.
The analysts of by Goldman Sachs think that the losses related to the credit cards could reach $ 99 billion if the contagion is spread of the mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rises in the rates of the expenses and of insolvency, it that measures the parts of the assessment not recoverable or that are it, more than 30 days after.
HSBC has announced the last month that he has taken $ 1.4 billion in his credits to the consumer, in part because of the weakness of the messengers of cards.
It is all the same too early to panic.
The expenses and the insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the rate of insolvency of 3,89% of the troixième term is inferior nearly of a point in relation to his historical average.
The deterioration of the rates is in part explicable by technical factors.
A change of the laws in 2005 to the Etats-Unis,concernant the personal bankruptcy has caused an abrupt fall of the archives of bankruptcy, which successively has caused heavy losses for the credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore of rate of insolvency) could increase even if the conditions of borrowings had to worsen.
The announcement industry beside the permanent rates of payment, which put in relief the sum of monthly indebtedness that the consumers must settle.
and the trust in the sureté of the capital of the credit cards is strong enough in spite of the paralysis of other aspects of the structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a society of research, has foretold that the volume of program for 2007 will be 25% superior to the last year.
The direct links of infection between the crisis of the mortgages and the market of the credit cards probably exist: the consumers could prefer of increasing their maintaining indebtedness that the equitable property borrowings have disappeared.
But the transmitters of cards mind more the flood of species rather than to the value of the patrimony, and therefore the fall of the prices of that property has inevitably not led to a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even bring advantages at thetransmitters of titles of credit.
The bonuses to the consumers for the payment of the mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the borrowing; by consequence, the indebtedness by credit card would become a priority to pay the whole again.
The transmitters of cards are capable of replying much more rapidly than the hypothecary ones and with more flexibility to such conditions of crisis because they can change the interest rates or alter the limits of rédit.
That should in theory reduce the risk of having a fast resumption of the actions.
«We are not going to wake up a morning and do not go to revalue all the borrowings. Has declared Gary Perlin, the manager of Capital One.
If a financial disaster of the market of the credit cards is improbable, there are strong risks of having one consistent fall.
If the inferior prices of that property and a contraction in the market of the credit take America to the recession, the industry will probably have to look opposite a future macabre.

The British bankers plead guilty for the case Enron.
The three British bankers who had to go to testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the previous chief financial officer of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their declaration, pleading guilty Wednesday.

NatWest Greenwich has invested àtruquer the procedures of bankruptcy in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the director of numerous fraudulent scripts, that has helped it.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had not valued his interest in the subsidiary as any, but actually the three British experience already his value.
A society controlled by Kopper has bought the interest of the bank of the subsidiary for lb 1 million.

Everybody hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates related to the effervescence of the world grant.
The actions are exploded of the two quoted of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to soothe the conditions of the credit, reducing ulteriorly the rates of interests promoted by the soothing declarations of the vice president of the American central bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after that Donald Kohn, n° 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, has declared only those that decide, must be «flexible and pragmatic» in their actions in the restless stock markets.
In an evident effort of reassuring the irritable markets considering these new tensions related to the credit, Mr. Kohn has declared that the recent turbulence has in part «inverted some improvements in the working of the thin market September and October.
If this hard turbulence had to persist, that would increase the probabilities of an ulterior rigidity of the financial conditions for the owners and the firms, it has declared.
These comments appear to the investors as an evident signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capitals in the American markets, and that of ulterior reductions of the rates of interests could stabilize the conditions of credit.
These remarks have also allowed calming Wall Street with news still more bad on the economics American, such as the biggest fall of property sales for the month of October.
Them affect of this financial uproar has been stressed with reference to the declaration of Bear Stearns, bank of investment, announcing that she will dismiss 650 people, in other words, 4% of his staff, to reduce the expenses to compensate for the heavy dûes losses to the losing bets of the property borrowings.
20 post only are foreseen in London where the bank uses 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones has increased in 331 points, or 2,55% deciding on 13.289,40 even though the greatest, S&P 500, indexes it has taken 2,65%.
In London, the clue FTSE 100 has taken 165,5 points is 2,7% deciding on 6306,2 adding more than 39 lb to the value of the British societies.
The German clue Dax has increased in 2,6% and the French CAC40 hastaken 2,3%.
Beforehand, the reappearance of the difficulties of the credit in the markets has been put in relief with reference to the strong request for an auction of fund sorting stemming monthly magazines by the European Central Bank, who has cut these loans to the European commercial banks to the heavy rate of 4,7%, the most raised since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and to inject of ulterior fund in the Londonian stock markets causing tensions of the credit, have made that the rates of borrowings sorting monthly magazines British «Libor» the banks, have caused their highest growth since last September, to 6,59% strong continuation one gone back since November 12th.
England makes in view of a call to the sentence in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are in view of two dilemmas, the one as difficult as the other one.
Who will be the drummer n°6 for England at Kandy this week end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And still more important in an as broad context as the first Test against the Sri Lanka, which will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, leader trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Chief Executive Officer President of England, starts filling the forms with candidacy to become a national selector, at least part time.
The one that will not manage to take away the dossard n°6 will be unlucky, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it also.
It is not ever easy to overcome what allows a man to arrive to the beep of his profession while another will never happen beside the inferior level, sometimes for lack of luck more only for lack of fitness.
It is not only to the cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the sentence remains subjective.
The good moment is to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just in relation to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee «tubby»?; everyone two, new frames having obtained good diplomas, professional, should be promoted: but it is of place only only for one among them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a cricketeur to less than one agrees him at least one luck?
The numbers have their importance in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketeur must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketeur of a day.
But to capture the eyes of the selectors is well more complicated.
A lot better have made the last season, for example, James Anderson that seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison broke out in top form and continued of him entrainer to serve.
Anderson has taken 32 doors of first class on 33 towers to win a place.
Chris Tremlett has taken only 29 to the same average, but everyone two already have lived their moment of glory at the greatest level and hope still to offer.
If that will be Shah or Bopara that will play at the stadium Asgiriya, that is only a question of opinion.
This choice could overcome or would be able to build the career of a man, but that makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty has played in every Test and well has succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful turns, but she was Paul Collingwood, who fought also to emerge, who has succeeded in becoming the primordial cricketeur of the Test, and that, in spite of the fact that his copy a hundred marked against Australia in Australia can to be still under valued.
The probability foresees that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, with reference to another discussion after the session of today at the stadium Asgiriya, will probably follow their conservative instincts and will favor the greatest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the teenager Bopara.
The two of them have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brightness and sizeable beginning to the innings of the Test of 88 to Bombay, 32 a hundred of first class against six for Bopara, which to 22ans is seven years more teenager, and his excellent classification to the launching.
But Shah has made only ten turns during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his city of player of the Middlesex, and only, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, asked for his place for the next match, seems to have upset his so evident boosts to Bombay.
Contrary to it, the player d'Essex is full of joy ofliving.
Nothing makes fear to him on a ground of cricket and he has exaggerated when it is lately fit with a hood itself on a 4x4 during one presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It has not taken back that of light injuries, has been shocked, even if the first thing that it has made was of taking his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and to call Alastair Cook, his team member who looked at it by far, to ask to him him «it had seen that? »
Bopara is the best drummer by far, his running appearance allows him to make services that go it, and that it beats with trust and professionnalité.
To choose the fair man is a thing, to choose the good moment is another.
Can be it is the true art of the selection?
I would be propitious to give his luck to Bopara, it that does not mean that Shah must not apply if, such the tea leaves suggest it, it will be he that will play this week end.
The buses bring back the people to the work, and to fight against alQaeda.
The first bus filled with iraquiens refugees coming from Syria has arrived to Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiled without money either without renewals of visa, or of others still that hope that the city has found the normality.
Some have come back to fight against the militants who have them far from at their places.
At the station of bus Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozen bus of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees of Syria and of Jordan who have come back by their means.
«I have decided to go in Syria after they have killed several doctors to Baghdas» has declared Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
«I have come back today because I have seen to the telly and read in the newspapers what has happened to Baghdâd and seen that the city is more maintaining sure. »
«They say that the Mahdi army does not commit anymore crimes! »has he declared who has imposed his men to move away for the time being, referring to the militia Shia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr.
Qassim al Atwani, a teacher Shia of 38 years of the zone of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, has fit with his two children, because it could not renew his syrien visa anymore and because the system prevents the iraquiens from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah have called it to inform it that the militia helped by the United States, has allowed driving away Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and have invited to him to fit.
One of the new newcomers of Jordan is the leader of a tribe Sunni and Shia that has had to leave his house to the north of Baghdâd because of an attack to the grenade after it has incited the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But it had to fit to fight.
Two days ago, some of my friends have called me and have called me to have set up a militia anti Al-Qaeda to Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys. »
«This is why I come back today» has declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
A lot say to have attracted by the increasing lull of the capital since the American troops have happened, and in full view of training continues of «groups of implied citizens» well armed to and collaborating with the American servicemen to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say to have been obliged to bring in visa and decadence of the capital of Damascus because of the problem, where more d'1,3 millions of iraquiens have escapes the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, has expressed the suspicion felt by everyone about the visas for being exiled that Nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked to the syrien government to limit to force the people to come back to the country.
More than two million and half of people would have escapes of the country because of the sectarian squadrons of the death.
«We did not have problem until al-Maliki comes in Syria and incites the government not to give visas to the iraquiens anymore, to force them to fit in Iraq« has declared the pensioner Sunni.
«I can not trust a government that supports the criminals who have burned my house when I have left».
The fall of violence in part can be explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been hunted of the zones of Shia and vice versa, creating places where the tensions are lesser.
One fears that a sudden flood of refugees increases the sectarian tensions again and bring back the fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federate State leads as regards professionelle training, and sparkles even throughout the international direction of his superior schools.
It is only in a domain that a deficit weighs on the sarrois ones, fellow man at that of the rest of the country.
"I have exliqué yesterday for the 50th time to a non-sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest state federated, by selfderision, displays for his 50th birthday.
To this level, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the system of training of the Saarland, system that is put fifth in the monitor of the training of the Institute of German economics of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the superior schools cooperate narrowly neighbors with the countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck by the French ones in1948.
To date, the students have the possibility of to finish their studies by a copy, indeed a triple diploma.
The high quotitée of 15,6 percent of foreign studentsreveals it.
The Saarland driven besides it also the children from the country to the schools superior in number superior to the average - a lot among them without a diploma of the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, one takes advantage of the system of vocational training", says Axel Plünnecke, expert in training by IW.
More than one teenager on five obtains his title from studies in a professional school, thus the Saarland is located at more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of a vocational training and academic are well developed relatively.
Considering the number of inhabitants, the panel of double program is the second best of Germany.
In spite of a practical training and an increasing request, the number of diplomés in engineering however has lowered of a third in the last years.
This is why the Ministry of the education sarrois has obliged the schools superior to a campaign of marketing in the matters of sciences of the engineer.
"After the first studies PISA, we have celebrated a great number of reforms in the general schools." said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced tests of comparison into the whole federate state.
So that the children begin earlier to learn, the last year of crêche is exempt to right - a model that meanwhile other federate states also copy.
Alone future studies of comparison will be able to show if the performances of the students improve in a lasting way.
In the studies PISA in 2003, the quota of students to risk has been reduced of 29 to 20 percent.
Altogether however, the Saarland has not improved as much as of other federate states.
The bavarois ones put through better.
And to the great vexation of the sarrois ones, the knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by the studies PISA - one could otherwise win points in this domain.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in the secondary schools - even if the sarrois ones are not French ones.
Chávez settles the watches
To the Vénézuela, the watches will make soon ticktock otherwise that in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, the president Hugo Chavez will make rise the stopwatch of a half-hour in the sud-américain country.
Chavez becomes meanwhile a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of the Vénézuela communicated it, because of a new law, the watches will be settled to less four hours and half of the universal time.
In this way, the sud-américain country obtains an hourly spindle that does not exist in any other state from the world.
L anti-américain Chávez justified his position between others by the fact that the États-unis would have imposed to the world the separation of the hourly spindles in full hours.
Furthermore, Chávez announced Wednesday (local hour) the suspension of the relationships with the neighboring country, Colombia, because of a business of hostages.
The nationalist of left announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, it would not maintain relationships either with the head of state, or with the Colombian government.
"I can not it, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez that hastens a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote through referendum for Sunday.
With this reform, it would reinforce approximatelyhis power in the country.
The release mechanism element of this argument was the decision of Uribe of depriving Chávez the mandate of negotiations about the release of hostages with the rebels of Marxists in Colombia.
Uribe "would have spat to the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new ringing of portable telephone makes fury in the country: "Por qué no you callas" (why you do not shut up) is the sentence that already more than one half-a million people have teleloaded on internet.
It has been pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent ibéro-américain summit, was irritated by the constant questioning of the populists of left and who has told him to shut up.
A fall of the salaries threatens Germany in 2007.

"The mistake brings back to the weak development of the salaries, to the increase of the Value Added Tax and to the ascents of the prices of the foodstuffs and of the energy", has called Gustav Horn of the Institute for the macro-économie and the research on the situation, to the newspaper "Bild".
New loads could also intervene as regards unemployment insurance for the wage earner.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said at the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the fall foreseen from the unemployment insurance of 3,3 percent for the new year was indeed correct and reasonable in the present situation.
However the Job Center does not have anymore the right to be in the trouble of asking to the Federation for credits or financial help, according to the words of the politician of SPD.
One has known Tuesday that the explosion of the prices of the foodstuffs and of the hydrocarbons had led the rate of inflation into his highest level for 13 years.
Altogether, the prices have increased in 3,0 percent of ayear at the other one.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
In spite of his atmosphere hostile to the life, Venus looks more like the Earth than what one believed until now does: the European space probe "Come Express" has discovered of the lightnings in the atmosphere and of the whirlpools of wind to the poles, equals to those that appear in winter on Earth.
Nearly for three decades, the scientists suppose that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European probe "Come Express" of it has today brought the proof - she has detected electromagnetic waves to the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst to a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud in cloud, brings back Christopher Russel de l'Université of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of the cyprine, the lightnings would have made the life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that have driven to the training from amino acids, stone of corner of the life.
It is not the case on Venus: "If life it has been, that must have been at a very old date of the History", explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Alive things to the surface of Venus should be today hardly: the atmosphere is about a hundred denser time that on Earth, it reigns over it sometimes of the temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is maybe the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin", said Russel.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth a lot and dimensions, has been struck of an also different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Come Express" in November 2005 was one important stage in the vénusienne research, since no more any probe was bound for the exploration of this planet for the years eighty ten.
From the opinion of the researchers, the most recent results of investigations that have been now presented in several articles of "Nature" do not underline only the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the mutual interests with the Earth of our neighboring planéte are more numerous than required to the first surroundings.
Thus the researchers have found a whirlpool of clouds at the south pole, which turns in a still well faster way, beside the whirlpools of déja wind known at the north pole.
The phenomenon reminds the drafts in the land hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni de l'Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planéte of the solar sytème has nearly the same mass as the Earth and is nearly as tall, with a diameter of 12.100 kilométres.
The planéte described as star of the night or of the morning turns around the sun in everything fair 225 days.
It turns however on itself well more slowly: a day vénusien lasts 243 landed days.
Although Venus, with temperatures in surface of 460 degrees celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not remind hardly the Earth, the scientists suppose that the two planétes have constituted in similar conditions.
On the two of them, the water has built up and it has remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but it has vanished in the space on Venus.
And even though the dioxide of carbon has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes the greatest part of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with theDalaï Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the quarrel of the parties about the reception from the Dalaï Lama to the Ministry of Justice.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks on the chancellor's wife after the meeting in September.
The federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and charges the great coalition of clore the quarrel about the reception of the Dalaï Lama.
"We must not present to the exterior world a nation divided on this question", told Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
In parallel, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalaï Lama by the chancellor's wife Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have a universal validity, even if I have of the respect for the differences between cultures" suggested Köhler.
Each knows that Germany should preserve a sensitive pair of scales as regards foreign policy, Each underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but Each defended Merkel against the reproaches according to which it would organize a political news of China.
The German chancellor's wife has not taken his distances with the traditionelle policy only of One China.
"China also knows it", said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly made experience his dissatisfaction about the reception of the Dalaï Lama and had been attacked for that outside the rows of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained notably about the "policy of display" of the CDU as regards foreign policy.
After the reception from the Dalaï Lama to the Ministry of Justice, virulent irritations made to themselves to feel in the relations germano-chinois.
Thus the Chinese government only has not put off the Finance Minister German Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information of the Spiegel, also has frozen the dialog said of strategy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
The leader of the government of China Wen Jiabao requires henceforth of the allemmande chancellor's wife Angela Merkel from reconnaitre that the reception of the Dalaï-Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that the European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, pressed Wen Jiabao thus the position splits hairs.
The words and acts of the Dalaï Lama would show that it tries to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regiones, what includes also other present provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Fighting of street with the police, shootings, transport on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Everything must be made of use so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany does not burst in the streets by the violence, has required the Minister of the German inside.
Of the barricades that burn, of the scrap merchants who shoot on the police with hunting guns: after the serious riots of youths in France, the Minister of the German inside Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must stay up to it that an explosive social not him contitue not also by us and is defused in violence.
We must take this seriously ", he told to the "Neue Presse" seemed in Hanover.
All the young individuals would not manage to put through with the fast transformations of the social reality.
The Federation, the federate States and the towns worked already avec fermeté for reducing the problems, said Schäuble.
That would not affect the integration of the immigrants only.
"From the summits of integration to the conferences on the Islam, that shows already his first successes."
But it would be however too early for an end of alert.
Schäuble made notice in the same time that, it is not in the German suburbs of sociological problems nor of the viewpoint of the urbanism as in France.
In the Parisian conglomerations of the north, youths had given themselves to serious battles of street with the police for the last nights.
In Toulouse also, cars and public buildings havelonged.
Greater efforts of integration on behalf of the German government, this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, required.
Considering the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would not be indeed so explosive only inFrance.
But nevertheless it would remain a necessity of acting.
Kolat puts the accent on the fact that the quota of unemployed persons by the youths below 25 years stemming from the immigration would be superior to the average.
It would be needed to assure above all more placesto the training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give a perspective to the youths".
The President of the Turkish communities added however that a social control in the families took more place in Germany than in France.
Many youths stemming from the immigration do not want moreover to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted: "But we must nevertheless be careful."
It would be needed "in a fast way to give the possibility of participating in the work and in the training to the youths".
Waiting, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything has remained very quiet for the night.
Unity of police was in place, a helicopter flew over the zone with spotlights.
The authorities in post have made part of three arrests as of some cars and burned garbage cans.
From the conference, a deployment of about 1000 strengths of safety assures the quietness.
The police will intervene as long as essentials, annoncait the Minister of the inside Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of the suburb, will.
In the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 policemen have been hurt during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the next night, the confusion overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots burst after an accident of circulation in which two youths had lost the life Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police are not persons in charge of the death of the youths.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entrance of the watch chancellor's wife that the coalition has put an end to the bottom - and that there is not anything more to expect from it.
In what country does this chancellor's wife live at the fair one?
After his intervention distressing in the debates generals of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor from contents, statement is needed: not here - not in the country that would owe, to the final one, to be governed by it.
The reproach of too much to concentrate on the policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel of a hard and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, it has said and only has shown thither that she does not want to understand what want the criticisms.
To the Parliament, it has made visible of everyone to what point this reproach was exact.
It was not nor of concrete interest nor hardly of feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, which escapes in the foreign policy and that same there rest in the to-few to.
For example the protection of the climate: in this matter, she congratulates itself over and again on the agreements of Heiligendam, but she does not say how the objectives on the climate will have to be reached in our country.
Even, the praise of himself to have as little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it still two years ago.
Now she clings to all made formulas, which the growth would touch the people.
Thither it destroys his picture of pragmatist, that résoud the problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the problems of interior policy are a marginal phénomème.
The poverty by the children and the worries of the workers down salary?
It remains it some secondary sentences for that.
In this matter is revealing the number of time where it makes slips when it is a matter of family benefit.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half precise sentence.
It staggers in unknown ground, from the moment that thatbecomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the debate of Youtube of the republican candidates for the presidential one, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney give themselves to a hard offensive battle - and now must fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates bursts already to the first subject.
It would have made a "refuge for the secret ones" from New York, reproaches his adversary Rudy Giuliani for Mitt Romney.
This against of his side by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for secret" meets Giuliani and reproach to the previous governor of the Massachussetts of having used immigrants without papers.
The candidates go up to the attack: as moreover the republican base does not have official favorites, the eight candidates for the presidential one use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their adversaries.
The amateur films of 30 seconds that the users of Internet have sent via Youtube are hardly more than the glassblowers are.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come in power", throws John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the patrol to ask an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney also is made make the lesson sturdily by the veterans of the Vietnam, while it refuses to condemn as a torture what one calls the "Waterboarding", a method of cross-examination where one feigns the drowning.
Though the fact that the important themes of the campaign go meanwhile beyond the war in Iraq and of the debates on the torture sees itself in the reactions of the ward of St. Petersburg in Florida.
What the conservative values are rented or that the future rises of taxes are refused, the clapping erupts to the auditorium.
It is there that reveal still a time where reside the weaknesses of the two favorites.
"I have made a mistake at this time", explain contrite Romney and present his excuses to the base and to the public televised to have in 1994 still summer a partisan of the abortion.
Giuliani on the contrary pass in a slipknot while one asks to him for his opinion about literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian.
A day after his withdrawal as leader of the armies, the man of pakistanais power Musharraf has been invested in so far as preside.
Thus eight years of domination by the army end.
The president of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has been invested Thursday for a new mandate of five years.
The pakistanaise television has broadcast en direct the ceremony at the presidential palace of the Islamabad capital.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
Wednesday it had passed on his load of leader of the armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and him etait thus forced into the international pressure, notably that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a putsch without burst of blood, the general antiques reign henceforth for the first time as head of state civilian.
By this withdrawal of the post of major in leader of the armed forces, Musharraf had filled the main particularity with the opposition and with the West.
Another central particularity is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3rd.
Already little after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to the general prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will fill another particularity of the West.
The High Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment state of emergency with lawyers of his rows, had thrown back the last week all the resorts against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6th.
Meanwhile five soldiers have been killed in the tribal region of the north in Waziristan du Nord in an attack on a military convoy, and four other casualties.
According to the indications of the spokesperson of the army, a bomb has exploded in a street close to the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock make their return.
The supergroups of the Germany of the years seventy replay: the three members of the group Harmonia have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return have seemed recordings of their great success "LIV 1974".
Already at this time, they were known well more abroad.
The predicted sensation happens afterwards in the form of three misters announced at the poster of the night.
Each has her small limps in front of it,his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years, thrones in the middle in a white shirt as snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, teenager of 57 years and in possession of a laptop computer and of a guitar.
On the right, observed through the whole auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years, bends on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, between others even aBeat.
And sometimes that is added by inadvertence to a traditional piece of music.
Moreover it does not seem too much to disturb the misters themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia works again has assured some emotions among the amateurs of Krautrock.
One has the right to unveil it here: targeted surveys reveal that the name, indeed, reasons in the collective memory of the pop one, but in no case so lasting way so that it groups misses so painfully for 32 years.
But why would the German not have so the right to celebrate his alive legends of the years seventy?
Accordingly more that what is called deceitfully "Krautrock" has enjoyed always more in England and in America than in the country of origin.
Lorque the industry of the music has awarded in 2003 the Echo price to the survivors of the group of Cologne Can for their work, one has seen the German pop faces in the room questioning.
While the Red Hot Chili Peppers also have thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the amazement did not have anymore limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of the ignorance among itself and the transformation in the stranger is the only and unique one.
The memory is of this fact déja taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed only two years and that for this period, the power of impact that has felt the way was well weaker than what it has been credited with thereafter by others.
Moebius and Roedelius already had played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
One played first in the cellars below the berlinoisescene.
Afterwards at Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized through the church, for financial reasons.
Rother briefly had repaired in Kraftwerk and finally had become a name as guitarist with Neu!, who was at that time maybe the most radical German group.
To 1973, Rother followed though the musicians of Cluster in exile in the fôrets of the Weserbergland.
There, in an old farmhouse of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they have lived as members of communities escaping the city.
Less ideological that in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be made to torment as nurse itself.
Rather an artistic existence to the way of Spitzweg.
So-called found itself in the garbage can a pennant of the choral one Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art.
A lot kept Harmonia far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and followingit "Of Luxury".
Because also serene and modest that rang the music, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest deadwood did not serve to him alone in search ofitself.
The CD "LIV 1974" that has just seemed has been recorded during a concert to Griessem in front of a record public of nearly 50 heads, as somebody thinks to remember.
Rother emitted at this time the wish to force Harmonia to take itself from time to time.
It was an immoral particularity for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced his separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of the esotericism and assured his existence with albums as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster was revived in the years eighty and has for more success that Harmonia has never had.
One owes the album LIV of Griessem in Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set itself the goal of keeping the Krautrock as inherent German contribution to the contemporary music.
Neu! had déja been dug up à cette occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, within the framework of the FestivalWoldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British one, punk antiques and author of the paperback "Krautrock Sampler".
There is the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte, also.
By which would the unity of the margin of fluctuation of the influence of the Krautrock be surrounded with regard to the pop future music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled in byHarmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno hovers in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the part of the farmhouse.
The projections of other photos in black and white of tools cabled in bazaar are used to the training of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy with improvising.
But sticking microphones more to the organ and to the battery, to get out unprecedented sounds to the instruments thanks to the instruments to built effects himself.
Today, the electronic music looks like the electronic music.
The three in great meticulous workers of technique.
Thereto even the choral one of the house will not changeanything for it.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and one sings to a pretty moment "Aaaaaaaah" with bombast.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It is not itself ever acts of rock.
The roots have been looked for less in the blues than in the conservatoires (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of the artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one that cries "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also does not let itself now irritate anymore by that henceforth.
But it that goes the more of itself be covered meticulouslyon the scene.
Where begins the music and where it finishes?
That can hit on the nerves of somebody (?) or well granting transient moments of great joy.
Moneybags Gere is not quite simply cynical not enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous peace", two films approach the war of the Balkans again.
But the two do not convince.
Or the projects rest de trop on the action and on the exchanges of insane shootings or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, same Moneybags Gere in "The Hunting Party" can not help.
The good news first: indeed the criminals of war Karadzic and Mladic hide always from the Balkans in the mountains, but it is precisely there, in the gloomiest arrière-pays of the war of Bosnia, that the actor Richard Gere is then met.
Us lastly had lost of seen the most handsome man of the years eighty, because much too many gentillets roles and futils in films to feelings for women and much too many press conferences on the theme of the Buddhism have delighted it the desire of showing itself.
Today Richard Gere is in a sudden way the most important argument nevertheless to concern "The Hunting Party" - while the hunter becomes the hunt (why the films of today must be also long and confused that of the collective conventions of drivers of locomotives?)
It delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: basically, his character of reporter of war Simon Hunt is what Gere would have been able to become, if the fate and the industry of the films were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for long behind it, but that, even as monument in ruins to his decline, however has kept visible rests of his old charm.
But in spite of this asset, "The Hunting Party" pursues unity with the German production "Murderous peace", which takes out also this week, the endless continuation of films failed on the war of the Balkans.
Of "Murderous peace" one can make rapidly the trial: the film talks about two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian one of the kosovars snipers, in which one of the two of them beats lover still promptly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbian ones are not presented for once as the only causes of all the harm, this as flat film as a television film vanishes in a well too fast way in the action and the exchanges of insane shootings.
That remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why basically never there has been a true good film on the war of the Balkans.
The history of the three American reporters of war, who are conditioned to track the criminal top of war "the fox", maybe would have been able to become, with another director and another scriptwriter (everyone two at the same time Richard Shepard), at another new moment one "Apocalypse Now".
Because the histories resemble in a striking way: two males go in small team in the forest, to fulfill something that the servicemen can not make and for the two males, that becomes a journey in the madness.
One of the reasons of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one does not let simply Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic endowed with a heart, as it is presented to us initially.
Moreover, not, the script must credit it with a romantic adventure with a bosniaque one murdered thereafter.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, while the reporter, in the space of the five last minutes, by an accelerated process, gets to what the NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of bonuses of the world have not succeeded at in five years: catching the criminal of war and leaving it for a fair revenge at the Muslim bosniaques ones.
It is so bad that one should refer the Haye of crime against the cinematographic logic to the international Court.
In that case, the film has a too deep human worry.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the American ones and the French ones (here they must be exceptionally agreed) of not driving the hunting in a way intensive enough because of secret political agreements.
But the pretty intentionné and sulphurizing it are this time so many fellow men that a famous poême of Brecht comes us to the idea.
That speaks of a mask in wood of an Asian demon on the worktable poête: Sympathizing, I see the veins of the forehead be inflated, clearly: as it is tiring of being spiteful."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that insinuate to what point it is tiring of being good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war of theBalkans.
Lately, it has been brought in in this newspaper that all the hollywoodiens films on Iraq were big flops.
One can add: never it has been yet of good films on Africa ofthe south.
What is worth every time: while a star hangs about on a home of crisis or on a minefield, he takes out some afterwards something as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits to go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in the time.
Which that it is, decades are always past before Hollywood can turn a good film on the holocaust with "The list of Schindler".
Some films well still must mature - those that are worth today of classical works on the Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in no case have been celebrated unanimously at their time as leaders of work.
But maybe ourselves know some today as simply too much on the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb happens en direct on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delighted to the scriptwriters the lack of scruples of which they need to tell beautiful histories.
"Being or not to be" or "The dictator" actually have become also good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know yet to what point the Nazi system dominated really.
Maybe that it must not be wanted to be kind while one wants to make good flims.
Maybe the sarcastic and outdistanced artistic glance of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk must be had.
While one has questioned it about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war of the Balkans, it has replied: "That holds only by the way that some things do not change ever".
"The great cities will be always horribly dangerous, the men always will be murdered of a horrifying facon and the règnera war always in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust gathers the criticism for the annulation ofthe Olympics.
The capture of retreat of the mayor from the candidacy of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of summer has struck itself in the policy and the economics to virulent criticisms.
A lot want to continue fight for the Games at the edge of the water.
But Von Beust calls to the realism in the appreciation of the luck.
The main manager of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as being "bad for the local economics".
Lately, no other project had spread as many strengths of motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the politico-sportif boost would not have been able to be maintained in the same measures".
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to take on a new starting point to longer term, "which takes as other starting point one modified agenda", it.
The mayor Ole von Beust has remained Wednesday to his previous declarations, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not" Hamburg "that decides on a candidacy for the Olympics, but the German Federation of the Olympic sports" told Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
Him renvoit to the discounted decision of the Federation of the sports beginning December, about the candidacy of Munich for the games of winter of 2018.
This preference means for us, who, in the period of time that we had hitherto foreseen up to 2028, we will not have any luck."
However the dream does not belong definitively to the past, hascalled Von Beust.
The sport Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted the declarations of Beust.
Of that the impression would be given that Hamburg does not want to put his candidacy anymore for the Olympic Games in the 25 next years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity itself, burying the already maintaining projects," said Wednesday the President of the HSB Günter Ploß.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be of more in contradiction with the declarations of the leader of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in assembly pleinière of the German Federation of the superior schools of the sport.
Over there, Von Beust would have qualified the candidacy of Hamburg to the Universiades of 2015 as "not being a substitute" to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of the superior schools of the sport had first in the past weeks nominee Hamburg as city candidate.
The fraction SPD of the mayor has reproached to the Senate for not having used this precious time in the building of accommodations in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook has been refused by the Senate for years because he has played the card of the Olympics and has excluded the building from accommodations", suggested the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
Even though the SPD has always asked for the Small Grasbrook for a plan integrated into the Olympics and a posterior use of the accommodations, the CDU would have bet exclusively on the "Blowhole factor".
The candidacy for the Olympic Games of summer in 2012 would have a great enthusiasm as his lift part in Hamburg.
Hamburg had broken though against Leipzig.
It is not the crates of Warhols.
The one that connects the concepts Sweden and crate in wood, thinks about Ikea, but not about Andy Warhol.
Or well so?
At the moment, crates in wood produced in Sweden throw shades on the list of the works of Warhol.
A great part of the eighty ten Brillo-Boxs of "Stockholm type" listed over there are contrefaÇons.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had put in doubt some months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the internal investigations of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm lead today to a de-enchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the guiding antiques of the museum Pontus Hulten have made present in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - thus than a great part of the others hundred of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm type", which circulate on the international market of the art.
The old history is tangled, one disconcerting linking of artistic productions and curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York her first "Brillo-Boxes", of the crates in wood painted, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the boxes of soap in powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - of the hundred crates Brillo made of box: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but they had been directly liveries of the factory of cardboard industry Brillo.
It was not here a matter of works of art, but rather of their models, of samples of exhibition.
In the same time, Warhol well had given the authorization in 1968 of making some crates produce in wood Brillo in Sweden, which moreover was not set forth to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses to the time talk today about about fifteen crates in wood that at that time would have entered of right in the history of the art and of the bids, as Brillo-Boxes original of Andy Wahrol authorized, with the appelation "Brings out the features for Stockholm".
Some among them have reached more than 100 000 dollars in the auctions.
The problem henceforth is that the legendary manager of the museum Pontus Hultén has claimed, wrongly, later than about a hundred crates in wood had been produced and displayed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would have given up him afterwards.
In truth, the 105 crates of Hultén have been produced at Malmö in 1990 only, for an exposure to St-Pétersbourg.
At this date, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, conservative in leader of the Moderna Museet, has examined three others of collections deprived suedoises, among which two have been made in Stockholm in 1968, beside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum: their stratified signs have been first printed and sanded, afterwards one has applied white oil painting with a brush.
The texture of the copies that date back to the year 1990 unveils on the contrary that the painting directly has been applied without coat of bottom on the signs not stratified, with the aid of a roll of painting - furthermore it is not a matter of an oil painting, but of an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol",laisse should be taken to hear the manager of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come from there another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in his collection as copies/material of exhibition.
Already in July the Authentication Board of course has announced, that he would hold an inquiry on the "heavy accusations" that will be lifted up in the business of the crates of soap in powder.
But for one is glorified over there with an inéxorablesilence.
The rebellious Soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, the rebellious soldiers abandon, the same that had entrenched in a hotel to Manila, and that had required the withdrawal from the president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President for the corruption and the ballot rigging, has told reporters in the hotel that he would not know to answer for any burst of blood.
The soldiers faithful to the power had little before seized by assault the hotel with the aid of lacrimogène gas.
The two dozen soldiers had entrenched themselves for hours in the building.
About half among them were held Wednesday in front of the courts because of an attempt of putsch missed in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
It took advantage of the audience to eclipse itself in a sudden way with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who had to watch them in a normal way, had apparently deserted in his favor and had joined with his mutiny.
Them him introduirent in the hotel Peninsula and required the withdrawal from the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops to the power finished off the sector around the respectable hotel.
The President convoked an urgent session of the Office ofsafety.
The national Adviser for the safety Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
