What will conceive? čssd in Prague knows voldemorta or cukrárnu
The new councillors capital from čssd will need to overcome a linguistic barrier to the Prague Council and in zastupitelstvu understand my re-elected colleagues from the ODS.
Newspaper aktuálně.cz members of the new Council čssd 'us', as they know notoriously established slang that the City Council first emerged during the last few years, when Prague essentially the current coalition partners.
Kódovaný phraseology that Prague's political cream introduced during previous eras primátora Paul béma, describes some of the best known figures of the situation and trials in the city.
Surprisingly, it has become clear that the new councillors known notions too.
At least this claim.
'who is voldemort?'
'I really do not know.'
'I am in the Prague policy more nervousness,' respond to test 'kmotrovského' slovníčku councillors on culture lukáš kaucký.
And while it is a political a veteran, respond similarly, councillors Karl Březina would.
To be on the concept of 'golf jamka'.
'It is a single word of what you have put forward, which sometimes use'.
'otherwise slang generally, I do not recognise the'.
From slovníčku whose expressions aktuálně.cz newspaper published in June this year before the parliamentary Congress ODS, took office six examples, mainly those which are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrátem.
The Socialists should explain the concepts of 'voldemort', 'the greatest golf jamka in Prague', 'go into cukrárny', 'bull šíje', 'betrayal of capital' and 'oplechovat'.
A triad of councillors with kvízem agreed, the fourth - antonín weinert, which is in the future šéfovat pražskému education - the first interview promised later but little phone.
The fifth councillors Peter dolínek straight test refused.
'these things at all neřeším and as entertaining's Civic Democrats, I am not going to evaluate.'
'I now řeším, as we understand it in our programmes'.
As has already been said, councillors lukáš kaucký, the heading for the supposedly nerozeznal that we are talking about vlivném entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora béma Romano janouškovi.
'voldemort' kauckému he says nothing, and the only deadline that the test correctly projected is' the greatest golf jamka in Prague '.
'This is the tunnel blanka, "says kaucký, and adds:' but that I know more from the newspapers. '
'I will have to pay a language rate' vtipkuje.
Golfovou jamku a tunnel blanka administration dešifruje matador Karl Březina would not only councillors, but also for the environment lukáš a timid.
Both the Social Democrats then know who is really voldemort lukáši plachému povědomé, and it is also where this figure to find - foresees the significance of the term 'go into cukrárny'.
'I think this means to go into some of the Prague undertaking', is a timid proximity to deal with that, it is a seat janouškových firms.
Equally with březinou recalls that knowledge načerpal rather from the newspapers, rather than a dictionary used.
In the social democracy, no similar to those at the test zaběhnutý slovníček slangových expressions exists.
'I advised, with my colleagues, but it appears that really is.'
'we say rather names, sometimes use shortcuts and distortions of names,' says the chairman of the Prague čssd Peter hulínský, partisans přezdívají hulda.
'at school bříza told me, but I do not know if my colleagues, so they say,' it is to its own přezdívce Karl Březina would.
Newspaper aktuálně.cz name tried and works.
Councillors weinert is for the party people děda or less friendly man who aroused pity, zastupitel Miroslav few that before the elections draw sponzoringu fraud in the party, has for some colleagues dubbed the 'igráček'.
Přezdívky are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in the internal mluvě concede.
Hulínský supposedly huldu deaf to, but the newspaper aktuálně.cz recorded and another dubbed the Prague chairman.
'doctor obuškového rights "supposedly recalls that Peter hulínský won its title judr. on the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to restrict the torture 'čarodějnic', published a brožuru
Women prohlášené burkině Faso in a witch-hunt have some common features.

Bakalův nájemník: awash with stoves, higher their rent for signed
Older stocky man vykročil from the door klientského centres of society rpg apartments' uhlobarona 'zdeňka bakaly, the largest private owner nájemních flats in the Czech Republic.

Civil associations bytyokd.cz that new conditions as they 'incorrect and immoral,' instructs the tenants of the new Treaty nepodepisovat and wait until 7 December, when presenting guidance as to how to proceed.
But the man that only mává hands.
'One says this, the second the' mračí.
Ostravsko becomes a laboratory of deregulation.
After the new year is a great majority of flats in the Czech Republic has non-market their rent for.
Aktuálně.cz therefore chose to visit 'laboratory' personally.
Havířovská čekárna rpg is one of the four on ostravsku and on Tuesday in nine in the morning is already full.
Next door to door, the guards of security agencies and with her vyvolávací device.
'their rent for 2011', it is a special button on his dotykovém screen.
One ťuknutí and by a number of machines papírek with.

After a bit comes to their rent for the elderly couple will ask, bursts in the waiting room, but new rents clearly at all.
Most people came to solve common problems, such as ever - requests for corrections, insurance events and the like.
Letters with the new nájemními treaties ostravsku to receive on postal letterboxes tenants of the majority of the 44 000 flats portfolio rpg since roughly half of November.
Rpg flats in letters proposes to increase the rent by 15% to 38%.
Special přepážka to new nájmům klientském centre was opened on 18 November.
'It is running over a week, so it is only in its' running in 'period, "researcher in the Bank for a moment hesitation when the client presents as a journalist.
Deregulation and bakalovy former coal-mining flats are local incendiary topic.
Before the elections, quite loudly seized Vice-President of Parliament and of native ostravský lubomír zaorálek čssd, and now it is local newspapers full.
'Twenty years after them chcu new floor'.
'... Ana CD for POs záchodě nevyměnili to me,' ulevuje úvodou in the aforementioned man.
Meanwhile, according to most of the workers are pensioners, to see whether they discount from leased out in good time, if sign them rpg in the special supply promises.
Half of their rent for new-hire President, also other tenants who new sign the Treaty by 15 December.
Havířovská 'deregulatory' přepážka but questions definitely zahlcena is not.
'from yesterday's 360 clients here because of the rent for 2011 was only about forty or fifty people' estimated researcher in the Bank.
Rpg on the web and their nástěnkách proposes individual negotiating treaties, where needed.
If, however, the rent both sides agree, it will have to determine an independent court.
'It is not about the threats, but for information about the only possible and completely legitimate lawful procedure' highlights rpg on its website.
'There is no judge will not, "thinks one of the workers rpg apartments, and the man on the street before klientským hub it partly for the truth.
'I have 13 000 income and let me five thousand for food, I do not have to be soudil,' claims.
Researcher, but immediately after all create huge uncertainties.
'We will see.'
'Mr zaorálek them in the media vzkazuje, whether nepodepisují, as some people are waiting, "thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the new year 2011, and rpg flats is their increased economic necessity.
'The rent, still less the need for a simple maintenance of the housing stock,' recalls Pavel klimeš, the director of the portfolio society rezidenčního rpg apartments that naštvaným tenant has increased vytýkaná neglect the housing stock is, homeowners the main reason for the increase in the rents.
While the five years between 2005 and 2010 could rpg of rents to invest in housing censuses four billion for four years from 2011 to 2014, it has to be 5.2 billion.
Conversely, the screen velkoplošná hanging on the ceiling polstrovaným sedačkám havířovské čekárny yet repeats several on red zvýrazněných information.
'The increase in rent in 2011 to 15% and less relates to 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of the housing censuses rpg.'
', and it will be possible to 7,50 just over $10 per cubic Square and the moon,' will appear on the screen.
For only 400 homes of portfolio rpg with their rent for rises by 38%.
In these cases, it is on the increase of the extremely low sums 19,66 just over $10 per cubic square, 'highlights rpg.
For 2600 flats remains their rent for the next year.
Rpg apartments promises that deregulation nevyžene nájmy skokově, but will be distributed in four to eight years.
Moreover, adds further commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see Graf) will give the company back into flats, mainly to heat saving - new windows and "weatherizing."
As a matter of priority is to get people who sign the agreement on increasing rents.
To include školka agents, grasp the architects
The administrative building avriopoint brně is domiciled in the new society arch.design.
No one would have expected that conceals also miniškolku with everything that includes - with barevnými walls, a creative furniture kupou toys and even miniaturním playground to outlaw terase.
Since October of last year, it can attend the children of employees arch.designu.
Arch.design projekčně-architektonická society, of whose ateliérů delivered a number of significant brněnských buildings, anticipated with the potential for corporate miniškolku since the first designs buildings avriopoint.
It employs the almost 90 people mostly aged babyboomu and it mattered to women projektantky and architect can quickly return to work.
Together with the possibility of jobs is školka zkrácených benefitem arch.design, which offers its employees in the framework of the social agenda.
Stavařky and architect get the chance to combine a difficult job childcare.
We have invented themselves arch.designu miniškolku employees, and with the support of the leadership they have managed to obtain a subsidy of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Corporate miniškolka is financed by the European social fund through the operational programme for human resources and employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grantovému funding (subsidy of EUR 2, 8 million just over $10) can buy equipment and equipment and for a period of two years to provide qualified personnel and traffic.
After the financial subsidies (2 years) is society arch.design obligation for a period of 3 years to run miniškolku at their own cost.
The preparation of the project took one year and with applications for subsidy significantly helped company economy ratings.
Care provides qualified personnel, for children to be looked after all day long by fosters a nurse and a teacher mš in kindergartens can therefore go children without age limits, however, is the most senior of 3 years.
As regards' miniškolku 'can be present at the same time, only 5 children, but during the day they will even more.
The operation of kindergartens is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right školku use regardless of the hierarchy of status in the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, programmatic content in miniškolce is comparable with the framework programme pre-school education.
Children are here not only play, but they are guaranteed and high-quality teaching, from basic cognition and training in school benches, is taught and the English language.
Class is equipped not only toys, inspiring games, but also a computer, which children can enjoy.
The presence of small children directly in a company creates friendly and positive environment.
Parents can ever to inspect their child and fall stressful situation zpožděným vyzvedáváním children from kindergartens remote from the workplace parents.
Parents and exploit the working time more productively.
It is no surprise that creates naturally loyal relationship of staff - the employer.
This has placed arch.design to the Czech companies that offer significant benefit in the recruitment of new staff are friendly to the family and, through this programme to strengthen the staffing marketing.
The House of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the spraying of the gaudího
The roof looks like other pravěkého ještěra, schodiště resembles the backbone of dinosaur and balkony open fish.
That is the home of the Casa batlló in Barcelona from the Catalonian architect Antoni gaudího.
From local to the House for its organic tvarům dubbed the House from bones.
Organic tvary, wild paint unusual using stone, debris kachlů and mosaic, some commemorating šupiny and ubiquitous soft curves, all of this is typical of secesi Antoni gaudího.
Průčelí House making snové line něžné colours and textury commemorating the nature and animals.
After a detailed observation is to see geometričnost, the rhythm and accurately measured procedure.
In the night for some houses sounds more dramatically, is nasvícená so that was the impression of colours even reinforced by luster.
Vinutí and kroucení tvarů is equally in the interiérech.
Timber in waves follows okenní Ram, zábradlí ozdobné elements, doors, and lišty kukátka.
The House batlló, which stands in a district eixample on an animated shopping streets passeig de grácia Nos 43, the home of the year přestavbou 1877 from architect Emilio sala Cortes.
Reconstruction, two years and the House has been completed in the year 1906.
Investor, rich industrialist, Josep batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of old buildings and creating a completely new, very soon, however, has adopted a gaudího idea of unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
The House of Casa činžovní batlló but Antoni Gaudí was not proposing himself.
He worked with him architect, Josep Maria jujol.
It is on his projektantském prkně emerged decorations for representational apartment owners of property and the use of the mosaic of this facade.
To this facade of work and many other creators and artists.
The work on the proposals of the House of Casa batlló was triggered by the successful cooperation jujola with gaudím.
Jujol participated in constructing a gaudího homeowner Casa kind and park güell, in which other gaudího works.
From local to the House soon after the completion has, through its organic tvarům dubbed the 'House of bones'.
Others it because of the specific mechanism of opening up the windows to call it the 'zívajícím House'.
It is said that at the height of the shipbuilding is vypodobněn sword of St George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include other sochařské elements of shipbuilding.
Gaudí in the House proposed at that time a unique system of central heating with odvětrávacími průduchy and typical komíny.
Bizarre may seem their forty five stupňový tendency.
When formulating Gaudí absolutely nerespektoval the building regulations and nenechával they tie.
At the beginning of the construction has received from the city of construction permits, but the aforementioned data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in completing the result was the City Council zhrozena and called for a remedy.
Radním appears, for example, that the construction pillars and intervene in public chodníku.
To rectify this never happened, on the contrary, only fifteen days after the challenge of urban areas, Josep batlló applied (and successfully gained) authorisation to rent out two of the buildings.
He himself a man to step into the lower tiers.
In the gallery at the second floor was social Salon and in the third floor ložnice and private parts bytu.
The bottom was pronajato klenotnictví.
The whole House it crosses šestipatrový schodiště, which can climb right up to the very střešní terasu.
The essential elements of perestroika was the abolition of all genuine angle and direct lines and their replacement zakřivenými walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of interconnection between space.
The social part can be opening the door to combine salonních completely and more society together can comfortably communicate without at the same time nezachovala privacy needed for intimnější talks.
The House with gaudího přestavbou gained in addition to the new fronts also non-traditional roof and two floors.
It is also an impressive gaudího game is light, blue and bíle glazované dlaždice, which is obložen internal auditors, and světlíky.
The two colours adds immense lights in all echelons of the House.
It is enough simply to bet on the principle that the White reflects the light of more than tmavá, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
The House of Casa batlló in 2005, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage, everyone can visit.
In the floor of the House is nejprostornější and nejhonosnější be made available to the public.
Owners for this action decided in 2002, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of a famous creator.
For examinations on getting as discovered that it is a very favourable enterprise and, moreover, checks to extend a common and podkrovní spaces, including střešní terasy.
Vstupné into memory is definitely not negligible, makes 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist průkazek have a 20% cut.
Sum significantly exceed the cost of vstupného to other gaudího structures in the city.
If you want a taste of the right of the House with dračími věžičkami, you have to quickly skamarádit with some of the population činžáku and visiting them directly at home.
How to select matraci and rošt: women have different requirements than men
Not honosný Kanshi Ram beds, but quality lehací tables, and thus matrace rošt, provide the basis for the really good beds.
It must, however, harmoniously complement to suit the particular user.
When selecting determines a lot of things, from the weight, height, age, health and gender.
It is also important, of the matrace and rošt are buying.
A typical example?
To be on the weekend chalupy where we regularly netopí, are not suitable latexové matrace, because more slowly 'zahřívají'.
Moreover, have significantly more weight than the standard polyuretanová matrace.
At the same time, it must be regularly contacted.
If, in fact, have a lot odvzdušňovacích kanálků at its core, and even rests on a solid board, intercepted vlhkost: it could, under them to identify and blight.
In the choice is also a custom.
Who has spent some time abroad, which is often used by the very high matrace změkčující layer, it will feel well on low and with a surface.
'Perhaps all hokejisté who are coming from nhl, accusing me that here nevyspí.'
'on their shoulders, heels and otlučená boky matrace needed to změkčující layer lazy foam.'
'This is recommended, even for people with diabetes, who have the disorder of the human nervous system so badly přejímají, information' of the joint degeneration, and skin, 'explains Sylva hadamcziková that čalouněný furniture specialises.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers so ago matrace with línou pěnou sháněla.
'It is now in the humour, appropriate matrace has to be tempur, the Italian magniflex, but also the Czech tropico.'
You do not need to be borec from nhl to appreciate línou pěnu.
This "miracle" is simple.
Optimises its tuhost and shape under absorbovaného heat or adapt your teplému body.
Nothing you pushing in the night not převracet as the heavy game.
Quite simply, better vyspíte.
Lazy foam works and protection against proleženinami.
In the choice of size matrace to its altitudes přidejte chodidla even duration, which is around 21 and 34 height.
A man and a woman with the height of around 180 height so they need bed 210 to 220 height.
The minimum šířka for one should be dvoulůžka 90 height, together, 180 height.
In separate nets, e.g. singlistů, recommends at least 120 to 140 height.
For comfort and possible visit.
'that is the rule on the breadth of bed simple: in camps on the back, you should have slightly in the hands of comfortably pokrčené lokti,' instructs ing. Helena prokopová cechmistryně cechu čalouníků dekoratérů, and that is the issue of healthy their sleep and ergonomie furniture pays for a number of years and lectures in vocational colleges.
For dvoulůžka needs everyone owns rošt and matraci, however, careful in buying to reconcile the height matrací.
Otherwise, there would be nothing other than rošty screw it in. In the various hikes, that you, however, for each rámu beds may not succeed.
Pěnové matrace should have the value of at least 14 height, types of with pružinovou kostrou at least 15, at least three centimetry count on tvarovací and kypřicí layer.
'dotyku hands or landing on every pružiny matraci certainly feel' warns Helena prokopová.
Each matrace requires a certain type of roštu.
When matrace celočalouněná bed nets, and the Foundation are as srostlá siamská twins have in ložnicích what to do.
Matrace poorly větrají cannot be vyprat their potah, which today is commonplace.
And as for the night commonly vypotíme 0.2 when 0,75 l potu, it is clear that after five to seven years matrace starts to one large (and ucpané) sítko.
I therefore reject the advertising slogans about the life of the experts matrací up to 25 years or even lifelong guarantees.
However, everything has its problems.
And that is why the Council in practice from vendors: 120 or 140 šířkou matrací the height of hygiene and work snímatelný povlak nevzdávejte, but přidejte to matracový chránič that you can easily free up and vyprat.
Although today to produce potahy matrací zdrhovadly around the constituency so after rozepnutí get two parts (for money and size of washing machines a lot of important!), but could manipulation of larger types of (and in one man) in the taking of lightweights contested in the towel with severe.
You are in place roštu solid CD for beds?
Never!
A maximum of bed specified for the visit to one night.
For nevertheless opatřete (if it is no longer) větracími small holes and use matraci with pružinovou kostrou and the height of at least 15 height with pružinami in bags (něm.taschenfederkern) and kypřicí layer.
Polyuretanová matrace on such a basis is not.
On nepolohovací lamelové rošty with 14 to 18 lamelami will be appropriate latexové or sendvičové matrace (to be a combination of latexu and kokosu), but it has always paid rošty with a larger number of lamel, 28 and more, where lamely in the shoulders of duplicated and it is possible to regulate their tuhost.
It does not belong to polohovací lamelové rošty matrace with pružinovou kostrou because polohování unresponsive.
In addition to setting tuhosti lamel can be granted and the so-called ramenní kolébku.
It is a special embed lamel, which enables force, or even lamelu there, so that our shoulder spáče much 'zabořilo'.
For men who have bolted across the whole of the 'heels', certainly an important point.
Even to remember and producers who, in the 'matrací pánských' used změkčující zone in the field of shrug.
Women also remember - those in turn dopřávají softer surface in places kyčlí.
For nejnáročnější customers are addressed to křidélkové or destičkové rošty with the so-called multitorzním pérováním.
Pressure was disintegrating into a number of points and reduces the tensions.
However, when you look at the right matraci and rošt bad backstop naducaný 'and' (a), a majority of 'plus' disappear.
The basic rule is simple: backstop is podepírat head and elite to intervene only to ramenům, to be able to release ramenní muscles.
As the appropriate size recommends 50 X 60 height, which show, for example, in Scandinavia.
In the camps to shoulder should backstop unwind (together with the cradle of ramenní roštu or změkčenou zone in setting ramene matraci).
Modern matrace have with the original slamníky plněnými travinami, after all, something in common.
Their manufacturers, are increasingly using natural materials or ingredients.
The trend is simply for matrací bio.
Raw materials from oil, of which are produced polyuretanové foam, are replaced by natural oleji, for example, from skočce and soya.
It is soybean use all known for producers.
'bio for matrací means that the core is produced from material purely natural "explains Peter vašíček of firms tropico plus.
Natural substances are used in the production of potahů matrací, one of the first was aloe Vera.
But you can also afford mikrokapsle you to uvolňovala fresh odour of forest or levandule.
There is also the division for men and women.
While men 'cooling' rostlinný extrakt from břízy to potah matrace absorboval heat and ochladil body, on the contrary, women potahy 'drowning'.
Extrakt from red papriček increases the circulation of blood, so it is less gender tepleji.
Today's favorites?
Matrace manufactured from the cold foam (more póry with porušenou brave structure, is so prodyšnější than the ordinary polyuretan and offers better elasticitu.
A combination of different tuhostí cold pěn and 'lazy' foaming arise vícezónové matrace, which know exactly where it should be heading, shoulders and heels.
For quality matraci a case from seven thousand kronor and above.
Those who meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as a medical equipment.
First, in the Czech Republic on this advantage gumotex.
Economising on matraci and roštu is not easy.
Sometimes we can use to the actions of the producers and retailers who offer two matrace for the price of one.
To label magniflex offers matraci duofreeze všitou by the paměťovou pěnou potahu for Amendment 990 to 11 kronor.
The second is, however, already held freely.
The era of líných or viskoelastických pěn with open brave structure and high hustotou was' a space 'the pace of material tempur.
Arose originally as a material for NASA because, in the face of enormous startech were astronauts on congestion.
To keep themselves warm tempur měkne chladnu zpevňuje, on the contrary.
The human body is perfectly teplému adapt and a setback, then its pressure.
It is therefore the ideal against the emergence of proleženin, but also to increase comfort in their sleep.
Viskoelastické foam are used not only to matrace, but also on medical products, in particular a cushion under their feet, which odlehčují nohám and žilnímu system.
For example, manufacturers use tuzemští pěnu eucatherm C or twinsaver and so on.
Appliances on the monitoring of the people it wants more and more parents want so uhlídat their children
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of guard over GPS.
The system originally stvořený for the search for cars, it may also be the movement of people and thereby help in such cases, which is the disappearance of devítileté aničky janatkové.
Equipment is still great as krabička from sirek, soon, but it can be large as clockwork.
A number of people terrorized case disappeared aničky and the quest for resources to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of their privacy.
'We are trying to say that there is no spy, but on the other a means to reduce the likelihood that it will be a tragedy, "says Petr wood from the company macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers surveillance facilities on the Czech market.
'I admit that in a case may be a misuse of such installations, when in bags of someone who knows about this, but we have to cope with such a case not.'
'majority that customers buy for reasons of security,' to wood.
It would always child should know what purpose 'krabička' serves and how it is used in the case of an emergency.
Child psycholožka Dan bočková draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want nothing to wear, simply be discarded.
'very small children are showing a great deal of creativity in how some things schválně to lose if they do not want to be under control.'
The 'great expectations incited previously with the parents phones, but will turn off as well as the monitoring facilities' claims bočková.
Accordingly, it is questionable whether, in the case of attack really equipment helped.
'with regard to the kidnapping, ensure a virtually always to have my child should any electronics, which could reveal its geography.'
'It is now a phone.'
'when they begin to expand monitoring facilities, will seek, and it is because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising'.
'In the case of criminals are always one step ahead from the police, "says psycholožka.
It acknowledges, however, that such facilities can help in the event of a sudden attack pedofilem.
According to Robert Czechs from society RC monitoring, which offers monitoring services for cars and, even when it comes to the attack on the immediate destruction of surveillance facilities, can help its presence.
'facilities can be set for regular send location after a certain time.'
'If the damage will be available for at least the final position of the person concerned.'
'more expensive equipment, which is built and náklonometry, so that even if you only uklouzl and remained nehybně lie immediately send the warnings with udáním location,' says the Czech.
According to him, a similar service can do and smart mobile phones with navigací, where just nahrát and special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either for appliances similar přívěskům the size of the packs from sirek or smaller mobile phones.
Always threatens their loss.
According to the macro pilina Weil, is now being tested facilities vypadající as ordinary digital clockwork.
'this will have the greatest advantage in the fact that the aggressor may not monitoring facilities at all.'
'or is about to some time and it can give the police of the extra time,' gives.
Whatever the monitoring facilities put into náramků or přívěsků, will continue to use the same technology, which is used to leave their vehicles.
It is a combination of mobile-phone location through GPS (who use the normal autonavigace) and the functions of a mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle.
The army zápalných cord banks that obmotaly the Czech Republic last but only two years.
The Czech army has acquired 445 kilometres of cord banks, which they fire explosives.
Already, the Defense Ministry has given to stores 224 kilometres of cord banks.
The army has the stocks to 225 years.
The problem is that a cord banks is two or four years.
The army's zápalné cord from stock stv group Inc. for 40 million kronor.
The general staff in the justification for the purchase of such a huge amount of cord banks zápalných mf today's that soldiers in training to consume 60 kilometres zápalnic per year.
The calculations by the military, which has approached pyrotechniků mf today, however, that it would be very intensive pyrotechnickým training had to go through each and all the generals, officers command of the army, secretaries or cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and the chief of the army vlastimila picka included.
Only then would justify the annual consumption of the army 60 kilometres zápalnic.
This corresponds to the length of the 25 thousand eruptions.
And even if it really was the reserves of the army would vystačily for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, to basic training of any new professional just at most two metres zápalné cord, as they say, so the army of the purchase of guarantee - and the increased consumption ženijních or special forces - stocks in those 225 years.
The rapid deployment of the burqa, Minister Vondra recently, personally, accusing that hardly any bullets to do it in ručních weapons, so that they are also shootings because of the shortage of money.
The lack of their underwear.
'I also takes the head, since we are buying repeatedly as many zápalnic.'
'But that is their decision and certainly know what they will.'
'for us, the army is a good customer, as traders, we are trying to comply with, says the business manager stv group, John děcký.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan pejšek rationalize hundreds of kilometres nakupované cord that army will have stocks of this' munitions' for at least ten years.
John děcký from stv group, however, only discusses Quadrennial viability zápalnice and police or military pyrotechnici even just two years.
'In a perfect storage can also be those four, "says one of them, a soldier because of the criticism of the army wants to publish the name.
After the life of every munitions must be carefully tested, whether it is still reliable and threatens soldiers on life.
These tests, however, are not free of charge, and they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of the quantitative rebate on 445 kilometres zápalných cord banks.
'cost us about 60% less than last year's supply of 200 44 kilometres,' it conveys the spokesperson pejšek position nákupčích Defense Department.
For the sake of comparison, the annual consumption launch cord banks police pyrotechniků who destroy munitions from the second world war, or the following the Soviet army, doesn't exceed its past few years 1 500 metres.
And the police order always so many that this ammunition spotřebovala even before the expiry of working life.
In fact it for the sake of security pyrotechniků, and can, moreover, more flexibly to obtain more modern and, therefore, more reliable types of cord banks.
The Ministry of Defence is already considerable difficulties with the removal of tens of thousands of tonnes of bombs from the Warsaw Pact, which completely annihilated Czechoslovakia's army prepared to campaign on the Rhine.
According to the Czech pyrotechniků mf today, which has approached, waiting for a few years, the same problem: it will destroy hundreds of kilometres of old zápalnic that today 'inexpensive' purchases.
Today čerpám of contacts that I have received through competition
The victorious in the competition of the trader year helped lukáši pytlounovi franšízy in the sale of his hotel.
The winner of last year competition trader year became osmadvacetiletý entrepreneur lukáš pytloun from liberce.
It is like the story of the success of the film.
I travelled lukáš pytloun.
And abroad realized that in liberci lacking high-quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
The savings from foreign brigades and through bank credit to buy polorozbořený House with five flats.
That was then a student third year of high schools, this has been a great deal of courage.
'the ratio between the quality and price of accommodation with us, I did not give me in this matter nezkusil do, "says lukáš pytloun.
The first zrekonstruovaný apartment began to rent foreign workers.
All profit invested back to a House which gradually předělal on penzion with 54 bed nets.
Since then, for seven years of entrepreneurship gradually succeeded in liberci open up four penziony, two stylové restaurants and two hotels with the overall capacity of over 300 nets of all categories of accommodation.
Nejkomfortnější of them was until recently a four-star hotel pytloun design.
This year it but find themselves with another, equally good.
'We have just signed a contract with reducing the island for tisé, where we have sold our franšízingový concept of hotels and other client franšízu pytloun subscribes, says the last trader.
'and on the sale of licences to the operation of the hotel is largely involved is a victory in the competition of the trader,' gives highly pytloun.
The victory he has brought greater knowledge and popularity in liberci and the environment.
'me poznávali people on the streets, often me to add an additional gratulovali and I have to say that it was a pleasant,' recalls.
Participation in the competition certainly recommends all those who have something.

Is that still derive from the contacts and známostí, which might not otherwise not.
'with some of the competition, which I met, I began regularly being traded.'
Cheers for associated with the success it has hit a little, for every worker.
And that is around sedmdesátky.
'I see them greater loyalty and pride that helps to something that has received general recognition.'
'It is not far from just my personal success, it is the result of good work of all of us together.'
'My name is vystrčeno to the fore, "says today modestly lukáš pytloun.
I wish my successor calmer year than we had in farmetu
The euphoria of victory rapidly surrounded the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winners, however, has cílevědomosti farmet bad times.
For the prize in the first place last year competition Vodafone company of the last year in slovanském House has a firm farmet, Karl žďárský.
The jury was praised efforts by which built from small nástrojářské workshops in the Czech skalici company is stamilionovými obraty.
'I can say that the appreciation to encourage not only me but all my collaborators and increased self-confidence for us struggle with competition, "says this last winner.
At the beginning of the history of the firms farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state has offered a father Karl žďárského to rent one small dílničku as compensation for property which was seized by the Communists, not for a long time, refused to a career in the company, which then has worked, and with a few friends around his táty establish firm on plastic bathtub.
Soon, then started to specialise in presses vegetable oils.
After eighteen years of them has become the biggest producer of automatic lisů in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the public neodbornou the company received the success in competition through the media.
'not only our customers have begun to see the brand farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that, together with a company that has achieved in his country greater success, "says Karl žďárský.
Last year, however, was not the only marked the euphoria of farmetu vítězsví.
The award was based on the economic results of firms in 2008 and only partly from the year 2009.
And it is precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year they ask for the sale of goods.
During the height of the crisis, which is still so much nedotýkala citizens, but companies already zastavovaly their investment projects, and to restrict purchases of new machines and technologies.
'This situation is, of course, no or the US.'
'sales have fallen by 40%, we have had to limit production and also to redundancies, "explains Karl žďárský.
Viable company must be able sometimes also do such unpopular measures.
The situation but managed and firm keep in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
What, however, in farmetu neslevili is investment in research and development.
'from the subsidies we have built research and training centre, we have strengthened the presentation on the international veletrzích, received the prize in domestic exhibitions, "says žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales of increasing again and, with them, the number of new employees.
The 'new winners I wish a pleasant sense of victory, but in calmer atmosphere' vzkazuje Karl žďárský.
Poll, which removes nonsensical regulations
Poll on the absurdity of the year is the fourth time in business competitions.
Some pointless legislation has already been abolished.
Neslavným winner next year exit absurdity of a duty to wear the documents and the officials accessible online.
This was decided by more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
For example, social security require a paper land from the commercial register, even if the official it can obtain two kliknutími mice.
Thanks to the anketě this to change.
'The Czech social security for land from the commercial register in checks for paying premiums require no', said the spokesmen čssz John buraňová.
Posvítit on all the rules and regulations which must businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic to fulfil, and those nonsensical to abolish the purpose of competition is the absurdity of the year.
It is this fourth part of the race championship economic and between the public are becoming more popular.
If the vote were last year some three thousand voters, this year, there were nearly four thousand.
And it is not surprising, all kinds of legal obligations, which serve only to hinder entrepreneurship, is still with us.
'in the number of just churning out more pages for granting taxes are at the top of the world' notes that Karl havlíček of associations of small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses the Czech Parliament.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has in recent years become avowed aim of all the governments.
Compared with the rest of the world, but in the Czech Republic, the situation is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic, from the point of view of the conditions for entrepreneurship ranks 74. position, this is about eight jobs worse than last year.
Competition, the absurdity of the year was first proclaimed in 2006, and every year there is the same script.
Přihlašovat administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone every year since April by the end of September, which is the date of competition.
The registration serves web address www.firmaroku.cz then host competition collects seven candidates for 'anticenu' and will vote for it in the course of October the public via the Internet on the website www.firmaroku.cz / absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity which receives the most votes.
In this year's exit přihlášena was more than a hundred or, more precisely, 105 rules and regulations lacking.
Tipy sent to entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
Between 'finalisty' competition, so that, for example, leave the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of motorways and speed roads pay tolls, or for entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two agents and two toaletami malovali every two years.
The list of this year's sedmičky proposals is published on the website of competition.
The proclamation of competition, which is always at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenningu, which regularly attends the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, the culmination of competition asistovala Eva svobodová, Director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses, the President of the Czech Republic or Peter kužel economic chambers of the Czech Parliament.
'economic prosperity cannot function, where the state impedes entrepreneurs's wheel, therefore, it is my aim to abolish every year at least three dozen paragraphs, which today only unnecessarily complicating entrepreneurship', told the Minister for Industry and Commerce Martin kocourek.
The attempt to abolish nonsensical regulations nevyznívá wasted.
In 2007, the people most vadila duty of entrepreneurs to three days ahead živnostenskému office in the place where it is located permanent place, the intention to go to booth for an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed novelou živnostenského law.
The second most hlasovaná duty in 2007, which was the reporting of work in the way of its foreign employees in the scale of up to 30 days, was removed the law on the so-called green card.
And the third time lucky.
Absurdity of 2009 happened in the regulation fyzioterapeutům ordinaci large mirror, ledničku and two land weight.
It was this year through health ministry zmírněno - to have ledničku saw.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Assessment of the environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects.
What is new in this year for the fifth cohort competitions economic newspaper is category entitled 'responsible company 2010.
The mission of this competition is the promotion of a reasonable and fair entrepreneurship.
'We want this to support companies, which take into account the effects of the business environment and promote socially responsible activities, "says Patrik bartholdy, regional manager Vodafone mobile operator, firms, which is vyhlašovatelem and the guarantor of competition, as in the case of competition on rebela year.
In this first year of this special podkategorie main competition Vodafone company 2010, ratified firms, for which there is no success in entrepreneurship, the long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and issued a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities, one from the other diametrically opposed to a common denominator, their efforts can be regarded as support and sensitivity.
In one case applies, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or the health of their workers.
Among the fourteen celorepublikovými finalisty finds itself, for example, Prague's software company et netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams between employees who are involved in many turnajů in different sports.
Another example responsible companies from pardubického provinces is society isolit-bravo, which is already seventeen years is a major contributor nadačního fund sponzorujícího disabled children.
Their disabled employees, the old papírna poděbrad, of which there are more than 70%, and thus the title of responsible companies středočeského provinces and in competition Vodafone firm year is placed in the third.
The victory of the company olomoucku miryz soft, which introduce flexible working hours, moreover, reduced on average 35 hours per week, but without commensurate with the false salary.
It also gave the jury, preferably purchases from Czech producers, supports the civilian activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
'We are trying to recycle as much as possible to our businesses and our administration to the lowest possible impact on the Environment' explains jednatelka miluše ryznarová.
Responsible it firm enlogit from ústeckého provinces, thinks the health of their employees and for every laptop them an ergonomické chairs and klávesnice supports their work from home and their corporate actions uses cateringové services provided locally protected's workshop.
Furthermore, we support the foundation 'man in distress, which helps specifically local Roma community' says that firms Ondřej dry.
Last but not least, is also worth noting activity firms money and the cleaning of karlovarského provinces that my staff in the form of bonus nadstandardních contributes to their supplementary pension rights.
'for us, we are giving the contributions for food, transport, improving qualifications and recreational, "says Joseph strapáč from bruntálské construction firms czasch, winners in moravskoslezském county.
In the category of responsible company year were automatically přihlášeni all krajští finalisté competition Vodafone company, who answered the question of the questionnaire attached to the complex and send it by no later than 15 August pořadateli.
Never wrongly or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then pořadatelem removed from the assessment.
'If the representatives of competing firms provided answers to the questions, not the competition responsible company year to attend, but they are not diskvalifikováni of' major 'competition Vodafone firm year.'
'separate affirmations into this competition is not possible, as it is a podkategorii the competition company of "explains Karl Goldman from pořadatelské agencies bison & Rosa.
On pozemkovém fund in plzni police zatýkala in tender
In building pozemkového fund in plzni in recent days zatýkala anti-corruption police.
Želízka detektivové muzzle local entrepreneurs in the media and with real obchodníkovi luboši G.
The reportedly tried to manipulate the tender for the handling of restitution claims, so that the plot of land nabízený in competition concrete entrants.
He had to pay luboši G. half a million kronor.
'So far, I can only confirm that the police is dominated by one person as a minor offence pletichy in public tender and tender, "said the right of the Secretary of State representations plzeňského antonie Green that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs policemen after 24 hours of released freedom.
How can public competition influence can be given the low official information only speculate.
The spokesperson pozemkového fund lubomíra black on the question of the right in stating that the odloučeném the workplace in plzni actually accompanied by policemen, and that during the tendering.
"It was a client who, not of our employees' specify.
Public competition, in the name of the 'challenge for lodging claims on the transfer of land supply under the law on' and is taking place in the event of a plot of land nabízený shows an interest more legitimate asylum.
'these persons in the framework of the challenges they offer a higher value of their restitution entitlements, which have to be addressed by transferring vyhlašovaná than the value of the land'.
', offered claims for slot nabyvatelů převede plot of land and land Fund, the person who has offered the highest claims' explanation of the spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. was probably the information, who has signed up to the challenges, and because he is also justified person, because skoupil a number of restitution entitlements, offered the candidates on the plot of land that competition will not be there.
It probably inkasoval severance payments.
This would explain that in the detention of such a large sum of money.
Luboš G. have privileged contacts at PF in plzni in the past.
There was in the case of the former chief PF Václav sankota, which was criminalise being prosecuted for issuing the spare restitution of land on which it was a decision on the location of the construction.
It was then that gained luboš G. from the Fund, for example, land for the construction of a public communications, namely in the place where we should build příjezdová magistrála into industrial zones borská fields.
Later, very conveniently směnil with magistrátem in the House at the historic city centre, the value of the much higher.
Then the town had to resign because, otherwise, by blocking the construction of the land.
Households on housing připlatí hundreds of monthly
Households have since January připlatit not only for all types of energy, but also for water charges and stočné, the supply of heat and somewhere to grow even nájmy.
The family since January and will have to pull out of the pockets of up to 100 kronor per month, more than we do now.
Electricity will push up the cost of up to 4.6%, gas will be about 2% more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities will have to be připlatit for water supply or also podraží supplies of central heating.
More expensive electricity should households in homes emerge stokoruny more than a year now.
The price of electricity at the same time, all the main suppliers reduce, the blame is therefore a significant increase in the support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially fotovoltaiky.
Gas will become more expensive, while, of course, at a time when most people are drowning and they have the highest consumption.
Each year, therefore, must also count on the hundreds of kronor.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive for the whole of the Republic, changing the prices of the central heating vary instead of jobs.
An increase in prices are mainly larger communities.
For example, households in pardubicích or hradci kings paid since January for the central heating about 50 kronor per month, of more than 1,000 kronor per year in the family liberci.
The people of Prague, there is a risk that they will become more expensive by more than 9% of water charges and stočné, in the event that the city will increase the rent of infrastructure.
If not, the rent připlatí pražené 6.8%.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between lower.
In the north, where the Czechs now prices are among the highest, water charges and stočné podražit by 7.4%.
Significantly, for example, may rise in the price of rent in the 450 thousand nájemních flats, where from January ends regulation.
For example, the company CPI apartments, which in the estuary over Labem own about 2500 flats, intends to increase from January rent up to 100%.
Those who do not agree with the new annual rent, intends to give the company to court.
Regulated nájmy paying people in around 300 thousand flats May next year is to rise by up to 10%.
The Czech children opíjejí fernetem and rumem is going out of fashion. Beer, takes slowly
Fernet, rum vodka, exceptionally, the better the whisky ukradená parents.
These are drinks, whose vypití ends most often in the care of doctors opilci, which has not yet been or fifteen years.
The exception are children, which is making the monkey treated in hospital repeatedly.
This stems from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases on the revenues of the separation of hospitals.
'a beer or wine are completely nemódní because it takes a long time to see opijete.'
'The trend is certainly harsh alcohol,' said the right primář childhood decoupling hospital hořovice in medium-sized Bohemia luděk Pelikán.
'when they will be able to extract a bottle tatínkovi from cupboards and it is to be a whisky, otherwise, but the dominant Fernet and vodka'.
'vodka has the advantage that it pour into the juice and not so many of them feel' explained primář.
And it also gives the spokesman for the truth fakultní hospitals motol Eva jurinová.
It is not the 'Fernet or rum'.
'This is a modern alcohol, particularly in primary schools.'
'in some cases were slivovici that we have brought from home,' said jurinová.
According to the primáře pelikána are thirteen or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in the hospital income relatively commonplace.
Before hořovicemi where there are starting this year, ten years on, where pediatrii in motole sanitky svážejí podroušené školáky from a broad neighborhood.
'One girl we lay around four times. "
'careers began in twelve years, when we brought with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood, moreover, in combination with extází' description of the doctor particularly serious case.
"was výstavišti holešovicích dancing in the party. '
'interesting is that her mother not at all strange about his daughter 48 hours did not know' podivil with primář.
It is the parents or even their considerable tolerance towards popíjení own offspring is considered to be the main cause of the growing child pijanství.
The dependence in the true sense of the word, however, according to the experts for children to speak.
Under the concept of 'alkoholik means několikaletá chronic dependence on alcohol, with all the phenomena that they belong to, and that children are not'.
'those alcohol use repeatedly, is more symptomatic failed rodinně-sociální background,' explained primář Pelikán.
According to the spokesman jurinové this pediatric clinic in motole hospitalizovali in mid-November around forty opilých children.
In the statistics, they will receive only those with a heavy intoxikací to stay in hospital.
Child opilci that after ambulantním treatment odvezou parents or housing is shipped police, does not count.
Except, children is seated in school and a bottle vypijí kořalky, there are according pelikána three seasonal fluctuations on which we can rely: witch, silvestr and the end of the school year.
'either zapíjejí sorrow for the wrong diplomas, or, on the contrary, hailed the start of the holiday'.
'but the witch-hunt, I experienced on income and seven of opilců suddenly,' said Pelikán.
Opilec, who spend a night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, is, paradoxically, the advantage of the fact that the second day at home vytrpí unpleasant hangover.
The heads of the morning of pain caused by dehydrated and a lack of glukózy, satisfies zavodňovací infuze with glukózou and by nutrients that organism lacking.
'They are, in fact, the better, because, after two evenings ago encoded marvellous and good awakening and nothing is nebolí.'
'only are distraught, where they are admitted,' Pelikán, that sometimes zkazí patients a pleasant mood at least a list of costs of their treatment cost.
The transportation sanitkou and hospitalization to acute bed, becomes and tens of thousands of kronor.
'I have sometimes not applied as an educational tool, when I am directly to those children then vizitě has been how much their drunkenness, and that could also spend throughout the summer on the Brigade to earn the one party,' add Pelikán.
Health insurance, however, according to him, to regresním management, in which the parents vymáhaly the cost of treatment, in cases of child opilců nepřistupují.
Two aircraft l-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two aircraft l-159 out of a total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence vyměnilo transport a Casa c-295m, on Tuesday odletěly into the Spanish sevilly, where aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS.
This is the first time that the machines of this type have emerged in the possession of someone else than the Czech army.
Abroad has only been a mere or předváděcích years.
It is about dvoumístné version l-159t1, which has been undertaken by the Czech army and which were letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are jednomístné l-159.
They still stands zakonzervované in aeru vodochody and broker trade - firm omnipol - is already over the last week.
When some of the aircraft physically vodochod, not according to John pejška from the press's Department of Defense has not yet known.
'jednomístné l-159 aircraft for exchange were excluded from the long-term stored aircraft, and this without further savings and investment on the part of the portfolio.'
'dvoumístné l-159t1 be converted into the current shape and form, "said the right pejšek.
To add that the army without dvoumístných aircraft will be left, because the ministry in May 2009 has signed with aerem vodochody Treaty in the value of 200 million kronor on rebuilding the four unnecessary machinery l-159 on two dvoumístné machines.
A new one has assumed a army in July, the second takes until the end of this year.
According to the EADS pejška pledged that aircraft will prevail in the equipment of some of the NATO countries.
'in the Treaty clearly says that odběratelem l-159 aircraft, the company EADS and will serve to the training of pilots from the countries of NATO.'
'It is therefore a matter odběratele the way this matter will be implemented,' said pejšek.
Economic newspaper recently reported that, for example, the Spanish army on l-159 is interested.
The exchange of five l-159 one Casa and the purchase of a further three planes for 3.5 billion kronor approved last year, the government Mirek Topolánek.
The Department of Defense nevypsalo on the purchase of selective management and addressing directly the EADS.
The leadership of defense argument went by supporting the future exports směnou l-159 abroad.
The Czech army from aera bought 72 machinery and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will probably also judicial aftermath.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence moved against in the European Court, therefore, that should choose aircraft on the basis of the pan-European tendru and not oslovením one manufacturer.
The army has already assumed the three aircraft Casa, the last should at the Prague airport kbely land within 14 days.
A longer ukazováček than prsteníček signify a lower risk of cancer
The men who have ukazováček longer than prsteníček are subjected to minor risk of ill prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion by the study on Wednesday, the British magazine of cancer.
It may have with the surface of the male hormone testosteronu.
"Our results show that the length of their relative can serve as a simple test the risks of prostate cancer, especially for men in 60 years, 'said the co-author of the study Ros eelesová, Professor Institute for research on cancer in the university in warwicku.
A finger that could help to determine who men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with the genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, to add eelesová.
In the period 1994-2009 followed with my colleagues in the UK more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and in parallel over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants should ukazováček studies on the right hand shorter than prsteníček.
The same applies to the likelihood of prostate cancer as for 19% of those whose fingers were equally long.
In the case of those who had ukazováček longer than prsteníček, however, this risk has fallen by 33% for men to šedesátky drop even 87%.
The duration of two of these fingerprints - utvářených in prenatálním period - probably reflects the various levels of sex hormones, which is to children in the womb.
Less testosteronu corresponds to the prolonged ukazováčku.
Previous research has shown that, precisely testosteron supports the growing prostate cancer.
The Czech genetik and the former President of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav pačes for čtk say that this study fleetingly knows, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingerprints and cancer was' completely proven '.

It commits laser projektily, to a few metres.
Special bullets to do it ráže 25 mm, developed for this pušku and containing highly explosive explosives, virtually works as a small shells.
Bullets to do it so that it can naprogramovat vybuchnou upon impact not only on the objectives, but in any point in its ballistic trajectories.
It can therefore be used against the enemy, which lies behind any obstacle for walls or zákopu.
The top is usually protected, and when to withstand the murderous rain steel střepin may be grounded in this fight.
According to Richard audetta, who was involved in the development of new puška xm-25 is the first weapon for corps, which uses' smart 'technology.
'soldier with it basically goes as it finds a target, it will send out a laser beam, which will determine the distance and receives upřesněný deliberate point, it regulates náměr and it will squeeze tap'.
'Let us say that you have naměřili 543 meters.'
'When stisknete mayhem, a weapon is nabije and exploding a guided missile to distance 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres,' said audette.

Zmrzlinová University
The 'gelato university' in boloně are preparing zmrzlinoví cukráři on better annual period.
The basic rate for future zmrzlináře, which is three days ago, is of great interest and visitors přijíždí from all over the world.
Where, in fact, the latter zmrzlina takes?
From gelatiere and from gelataio.
Gelatiere, česky bit zastarale zmrzlinář, produces lotion according to all the rules of the Italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio vyndá stěrkou ice cream from chladícího boxu, setře it into the cake being served and resold.
To see you do not need to go into anzola Dell 'Emilia Bologna in the province.
Who but wants to know more about zmrzlině, it will not shirk 'gelato-university' Italian firms carpigiani.
In 2003, created the manufacturer zmrzlinových machinery zmrzlinovou university to zmrzlina of its machinery matches everywhere high Italian ideals.
The basic rate for future gelatieri, which is three days ago, is huge interest and visitors přijíždí from all over the world.
It offers, but also několikadenní special rates for chocolate zmrzlině and praktika in their own zmrzlinárně.
Someone in his midlife-crisis yearn for a new career, others are daring on thin ice their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a teacher of art from California, loves movement slow-food and I would in future to offer high-quality European product in the country industrial ice-cream.
Anke from Berlin is podniková konzultantka and I would, after years of being stressful work to begin something of their own.
Two young an Egyptian woman dreaming that will open in kairu zmrzlinárnu.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil, they want to improve the quality of zmrzliny in their hostesses - and the Canadian a housewife Yulia, because its children love the Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain the participants in the ideal characteristics of the excellent zmrzliny.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also the Silk hebkost and consistency.
Luciano not fail in their training on jižanskou and their třešničku on the cake: 'the Italian gelato is simply the best - and then this is still a good dose of romantiky.'
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano insert the basic ingredients šlehačku milk, milk, sugar and stabilisers into a great mixéru that all become much warmer electronic programme to 85 degrees and then immediately cool on four degrees.
Then count on engine kohoutkem and vyteče pasterizovaný White basic lotion, the basis for all types of milk zmrzlin.
It is immediately associate Professor zasypán issues: is it possible to produce ice cream from natural substances without Stabilizer?
How can you yourself to experiment?
Luciano warns, to get carried away by the spirit of the times, into the unknown.
Who is talking about zmrzlině 'only from natural ingredients', probably as used stabilisers - mostly natural product, such as guarová mouka from guarových zrnek.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream and without stabilizers, but sold in one day, otherwise the will and the customer it the same ice zrnka.
Some variation fundamental matter is leave.
This will with napínavější aromatickými esencemi.
Luciano distinguishes the taste zmrzliny according to the ingredients that are buying in a supermarket either in the separation of fruit or in the separation of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
'suppliers you will seek to impose a lot of aromatised ingredients.'
'You should but simply experiment.'
Either the dessert sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or zmrzlinou from the White fundamental matter, which will change vajíčky on yellow lotion and kakaem on the basis for všelijaká čokoládová temptation.
Now, they are of course to zmrzlinovým strojům.
Luciano is to produce always four different types of vanilla, chocolate, and lískooříškové kávové zmrzliny - either with egg or without them in the basic hmotě, with the more or less vanilkovým properties or other natural přísadami.
The same experiment to conduct with dessert species zmrzliny.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pyré - given the taste that is not always better.
Lískooříšková zmrzlina not chutnat more oříšková when it contains more lískových nuts.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi fruit produced group, which uses more fruit, less water and a bit less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix takes up correctly says, taste gelato Luciano.
Production zmrzliny is a purely numerical task: to use peaches pyré with a lot of sugar, it must be to reduce the proportion of sugar in basic ingredients.
There is a need for zmrzliny against extra portion of sugar.
Luciano vyndá device, which determines the content of sugar in the fruit (winemakers this measure must from grapes).
Fortunately, turn the tables.
Production zmrzliny already requires so many physical effort, as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of basic fuels.
There is also a device, which is a mixture of zmrzlinovou umíchá krému and, at the same time to cool the minus the temperature.
Despite all automatizaci small accidents are inevitable.
Brazilan Gustavo zašpiní themselves and also to my colleagues from the top downwards ovocným pyré when he gets out of the control of the huge mixér.
'at any rate', considers Luciano, 'it is only a question of time, when this happens.'
In the light of the dual revizoři
The European food EFSA is linked with the industry, which has experimented with genetic plants.
This accusation is now voiced the group of experts testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
'It sounds like a contrived theory, we are however well documented,' said on Wednesday in Munich, the head of Christoph testbiotechu then.
The leaders of the group of experts of EFSA for gentechnicky amended plants, Harry kuiper, and other expert EFSA are already a few years of the Treaty of the Union of lobbyists ilsi.
This is financed by concerns such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way to the supervisory regulations of EFSA for genetic plants and is in clear conflict of interests, criticises then.
The rules of EFSA to agree in the entire paragraphs with documents ilsi and bear the script industry, which should be monitored by the Office of the Italian parmě.
This is the second time testbiotech highlights a conflict of interests.
Recently proceeded high manažerka from EFSA without amendments or the transitional period of the Swiss agrárnímu group Syngenta - and it has changed.
The radio for central Germany (mdr) revealed recently staffing interconnection eu-úřadu for control of the industrial lobby, which has aroused interest as the Ministry of the environment, as Members of the EU.
In the meantime, EFSA cannot identify the conflict of interests.
Working with all the serious data, as well as those of industry, if they are highly technically expert, is mentioned in a statement.
From the experts who work for EFSA, is not required to have contacts with the industry.
But it must demonstrate.
Kuiper admits its work for international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the US.
In itself it is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - in addition to the assessment of the risks of biotechnology without the Treaty lobbyists.
Independent experts as then criticise that are currently leave gentechnicky modified plants without any attempt in the animal feed, and that netestuje reactions of genetic products on environmental factors.
'We want to know, for example, what does gentechnicky amended maize in the field of', says then.
The current practice is only tested isolated proteins and not the genetic rostlinu, which nedoloží reliable results.
'If we are not looking for the risks as it was then it is possible to find?' he is asking žalobně then.
He agrees, Angelika hilbeck.
The scientific researcher investigates gentechniku since 1994 and is currently working on a technical high school in Zurich.
In this field, attempting to industry, as well as in the US, and now also in Europe still more influence or discredit the critical scientists.
This is why almost there are scientists who would not be associated with concerns.
The majority nepublikují studies, which are critical for society.
'industry the security research', considers hilbeck.
Footprint of stones
Uli gsell also some acquired, a total of around 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening before nádražím tubu stuttgartu, in the back.
The demonstrations.
Sněžilo.
The story is known: in September přijely bagry and began tearing down a great deal of northern wings.
The world in stuttgartu has been the same: thousands of demonstrating against miliardovému s21, reducing the station.
When the cessation of construction, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Rozbité to 6,000, 7,000 individuals.
Vápenec from crailsheimu, soft gross block, which has been applied in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years.
Assuring a few of these slices.
'these blocks are relikvie.'
'must not be lost.'
Being dissolved: 'cheap and poor cornerstone, simple and ancestral.'
When one rozřízl, smrděl after cigaretovém smoke.
What about those pieces will do not know.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell too.
Footprint of stones from stuttgartu leads to forest in Tübingen on the former deponii ammunitions the French army, where Manuel rongen establish its straight empire.
44-letý man traded with the old stones.
To buy all that emerged during the felling in stuttgartu.
'It would be a shame if, on štěrk rozemlely or disappeared on deponii', says in her office, timber booth, which was previously a house.
Tell him nadávali and jeopardize it, when in September in all the newspapers that bought vestiges of the northern wings from society, which carries out to the demolition of.
But he spoke for days with adversaries S-21.
And explain that to the demolition of them at all can.
And if this happens, then it is reasonable, when the stones continue to use it.
Then there were around 200 s-21-protivníků each around 80 kilograms of heavy bloc, the cost of up to 14 6,50 the euro.
As the memory, some also, in the hope that it will return to the construction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, cargo 25 large lorries.
About half is still in a forest, the rest have long since sold.
Gardeners krajinní zahradníci, developers houses.
They have come from all corners and odtáhli, as it came into kufru and přívěs.
Blocks of dispute from stuttgartu have long since transformed into 'zídky' or as flank záhonů with bylinkami.
'This cornerstone is actually nothing special', says rongen.
'If it were not for the political vsuvky.'
In its terénního nasedá cars and goes on projížďku after his 20-ti hektarovém UK.
I went ahead rights, studying the speaker later biology, studied the computers and ultimately salesman stones.
And milovníkem blocks.
It has been 40000 tonnes of stones.
Your their treasures of the whole of Germany.
It says that it is the largest obchodník with the old cornerstones of the Republic.
.
In the snow lies umělecky opracované pískovce.
'One belonged to marien-most in Dresden' testament.
Pískovec from labe, yellow, warm, is happy.
'My favourite stone.'
We are going to continue on the path of the ladder through forest.
It shows a bundle: the red pískovec, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And further.
'Fine travertin.'
Again, those kvádry on tribunu neckarstadionu in stuttgartu.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories cannstatt-travertin of police by the Presidium in stuttgartu, the Red granit from the temple of St. blasien, tuf of hospitals in heilbronnu.
What work, what hardship the pot.
When rongen thinks that, as before, officials by rozbíjely stones and carried through simple kladkostrojů and býčích povozů, it will become totally uctivým.
'It would be a scandal if something drtilo.'
Does not the rich, very rich, not at all.
Obchodník with stones but today employs 14 people and, in addition, be settled up in a forest kameníci, one sculptor, one kovář, one sklář and one zahradník.
'We are working hard, but it is satisfying', it says, anyone who has appreciated residues.
In the foreseeable future, must in Cologne.
There will be to rescue the stones.
The struggle of the talent of high-potenciály
For food is a lot of people.
16 students are pushing for chlebíčků with lososem, rajčatové soup and sweets.
The Technical University in braunschweigu and car manufacturers Volkswagen invited the students of engineering and design the workshop.
Together with the developers firms VW here have to talk about the car of the future - and, incidentally, to discern Volkswagen.
Many companies trying to plant on cleverest brains, as well as a firm VW to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible to recruit in posluchárnách most talented graduates, even before they enter the labour market and will be concerned about this.
Since universities are not issued any lists the success of their students, trying to firms appear exceptional talent in projects oriented to practice and to obtain it.
The braunschweig seeks to motor concern to obtain talent on the second day.
One young lady from the personal separation of peddling propisky, rubber medvídky and plates with the logo VW.
A promising young testament to talent, the programmes for praktika, student jobs and suggests them travel in the group.
Nico selle braunschweig from the old to the project, together with the VW.
It sees the advantages for both sides: 'students are in contact with the industry and to gain experience.'
'The VW can also tell the students closer to familiarise themselves with the very interesting candidates and reconsider the who' as an associate of Erdogan. '
Such cooperation under selle, are not unusual.
Innovation is, however, that it openly fights for students.
'It otherwise rather substantial expert project', says selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates might be even starker.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees for long crowd bidders.
It must, on the contrary, to try and try to groom a particularly highly qualified workforce.
Graduates of engineering industries have excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Union of German engineers vdi remained in October will remain unfilled 40.000 engineering positions.
And, according to forecasts vdi the so-called lack of engineers still grows.
For auditorskou and consulting firm KPMG is Roman dykta hunting talent.
By demanding recruiting-events, such as kpmg-race, the type of modern race for treasure, in which the participants must find a way to koordinát GPS.
The company is planning to send this next year eight promising students in the US.
The participants can simultaneously resolved branches KPMG and familiarise themselves with the company.
Beforehand decides in two tendering rounds who will take part.
Only crème de la crème of many customers will travel to the US.
In the competition for high potentials at universities will apply under dykty still tougher laws.
'We want with our approach differ from the others.'
'simple a tour in to a sailor was for us too little'.
It seems that lovec talent dykta has been lucky.
'We have remained in contact with all the participants similar actions in the past year.'
'some will soon end up studies and plans are for us to look for work', he says.
In addition to the direct reaching on campus, particularly small and medium-sized firms present klasicky on the labour markets.
'We are trying to contact the graduates to professional exhibitions.'
'as, for example, intersolar' claims sitha stübe staffing, the separation of the manufacturer solar technology solarworld.
The company of Bonn employs in Germany around 1500 employees.
Stübe knows the issue of young workers.
Currently, it is called 35 positions on the websites of firms.
'at the present time, it is difficult to fill vacant jobs.'
'it takes a great deal of time and money, "he says.
Another possibility is contact via the professors in universities.
Solarworld cooperates with the various universities, such as the university in freibergu.
'professors inform them that it is possible for us to make praktika or write diplomovou work'.
Solar specialist does no expensive advertising actions.
Instead of trying to company to attract other advantages: the personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
The 'great concerns that often cannot offer', says the personal decoupling stübe.
In search of work has long been playing the leading role.
Flexible working hours, enshrining children or good possibilities of procedure are other decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied in one study by the Institute to hold this great work 55. place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, asks aides, as are satisfied with their work and working environment and to monitor the framework conditions for employees.
The personal decoupling stübe hopes that it will bring the points with people wanting to work.
'I believe that the candidates are informed in particular on the external assessments of a potential employers', he says.
Wolf Reiner kriegler from the German employer branding Academy instructs companies that want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
Advise their customers to be more autentičtí.
And according to Mr krieglera this means, above all, an internal measures.
'the best way stunt as attractive employer leads through its own employees', he says.
Technically it is called the internal employer branding, namely the promotion of the employers in the market within their own employees.
'happy employees are the best ambassadors.'
When a company well cares about its people and they identify with firm, they themselves do advertising their employers among friends and known.
"This is like a game of ', says provázkem kriegler.
Obama brings new oil drilling
In the coming years, there will be a Côte us-spolkového state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, the new oil drilling.
The government in Washington has issued a ban - and thereby cancelling definitively earlier plans.
Before the Atlantic coast, meanwhile, are new drilling banned.
The Interior Minister Ken Salazar say it on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban on who should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion in the Tower 'vrtné Deepwater Horizon' in April.
Before this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and has led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure from the opposition and industry its willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of the US seeks to reduce dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clearly explained, who is responsible for the devastating olejovou cataclysm in the Gulf.
The criticism is the British energetic concern BP, which is confronted miliardovými requests.
Commission of Inquiry, which authorised the Obama should produce results in December.
In October, the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar ban on drilling, which has been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently by the various oil concerns the application of the new vrtné intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster stricter controls and striktními safety regulations.
At the present time, fundamentally reforming supervisory authority to the attention of many corrupt accusations.
At the same time, Obama has announced that the possibility of abolishing lucrative tax evasion for oil and gas enterprises.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulation substantially reducing the volume of těžené oil in the Gulf.
'Government plans are the biggest hindrance to the growth of gas and oil industry', is the result of current research in the field of consulting firm bdo - even before the abolition of drilling on Wednesday.
American energy alliance has yet to complaining about uncertainty in the field: 'No one knows exactly what the regulation will change'.
Investments in new mining projects until the lifting of the move - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni shořela
Water in rivers is olejově Brown, stinks as to pump: billion litres of oil uniklé destroyed nature in the field of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People eat kradením, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine akpobari it means well.
'netrapte', it is cosying up to the journalist green activist: 'today, you will receive before objektiv even enough oil mess.'
37-letý nigeriánec watched the attempt vyfotografovat boy brodí after prsa water flanked by šmouhy: the scene in water luster with duhovými colors almost as well.
That underneath plavou Brown vascular oil is not visible.
Previously, collected by vessels enough garnel, tell Mrs badom on the side of the river bodo-jetty.
In the meantime, become slowly resulting water entirely dead.
Five years ago spilled into huge vlahé area of broken the leadership of the large quantities of oil.
The fishermen of nedalekého town Bodo must row at least six hours to get into the waters, where the fish are: the Ogoni, which is at the heart of the Niger Delta belongs to one of the most contaminated areas in the world.
The way for the river mangrovníkovými bažinami with a lot of alleys přítoků is only detectable the whole scope spouště.
The engine of the boat brewed instead of light water hnědou mess and who plunge their hand in water, unsettling olejové fingers.
The roots of mangrovníků towers from countries such as black tyčky lékořice, rarely occurring Palma are letting their leaves the sad viset.
In looking for a flock of birds, which is normally in wet areas exist: once utichne engine of the boat, rozhostí in earlier havens where it stinks to pump, scare silence.
'What is happening here is the ecological waging war', says the sad celestine akpobari: 'We live in constant fear of health.'
Compared with the war is justified.
The settlement Ogoni is a battlefield, where several decades fights: more than 60 years ago, this first dobyvatelé damage from Europe, here, in the 1980s utvářel first resistance with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, have had to stop concern Shell in 1993, its production, because it was for employees too dangerous.
Today, in the field of company Ogoni must not return: while the benefit of the whole of the Delta to triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of leadership more than two million barrels of black gold, oil fields in the field of Ogoni fallow, for concern is the situation very unstable.
Every few hundred metres tower of water steel construction as a bizarre sculpture: 'Christmas stromečky' and to call otvorů něžně heads of drilling.
There are 50 years old, most to its core zrezivělá.
Every minute to break this head vrtného otvoru, tells akpobari, and then vytéká a constant stream of oil to the water.
According to estimates by experts in the ecosystem in vyteklo deltě more than two billion litres in 50 years: each year the amount of oil, what vyteklo into the sea in Alaska in the accident supertankeru 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
There are disputes, who is responsible for continuing to ongoing ecological disaster.
While concern Shell refers to sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90% of pollution, speaks ochranáři environment on the head of bursting drilling and netěsných vedeních as the main cause.
Shell requires in Nigeria, much less safety regulations in the world than is customary nařkl concern in 2008 us-americký scientist Richard Steiner: only the quantity of disorder at vedeních is supposedly 'several times higher than elsewhere.'
On the ground, which looks from afar as abandoned, oil zašpiněná workshop open-air to emerge from mangrovníků characters: they are completely naked and sick from oil.
Under one of the many casks, which are partly the leadership, partly arbitrarily roztroušené on land, fire fire: the illegal small refineries.
Oil is in sudu over fire is heating up a few hours, explains Michael, the leaders of the groups.
Ahead of leadership in detention vyteče hrnce gasoline later kape at the end of the leadership of the kerosene and diesel.
In this way, produces Michael and his four colleagues on a daily basis to four sudy after 300 litrech: 'We earn so 34.000 naira' - around 22 dollars.
The people of the Delta are a chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil state black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one Sucre.
The ridiculously low cost of 40 cents euro per litre of diesel illegal manufacturers can even override them, because they are the raw material free of charge.
It came from 'bunkerů' who napojují on leadership everywhere in the area of Ogoni: according to the experts in the whole area of the Niger Delta loses the country on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of oil.
But only a small proportion of provisionally zanedbatelně skladované raw materials are illegally zušlechtí: the largest proportion fulfils organised criminal networks, to which they belong, and politicians and senior officials of the army, tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether caused the disaster of the people and their interventions or lax way of producing, considers the activist akpobari as purely academic.
'If we had any oil companies as an alien and if so perfectly not destroyed the essence of the fishermen, then it would not sabotage or theft and illegal refineries.'
In the meantime, but it is the relationship Ogoni primarily to shell so poničený that falls into account only the exodus group: 'Perhaps show other nations such as the Chinese as better'.
Michael unsettles.
'high time to have disappeared, "says svalnatý producers.
'every minute can come to the soldiers'.
If it is found a special military unit, so they may not prison, but the painful bribery.
Also the soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - as all nigeriánci - want to profit from raw materials.
'tadle prokletá thing, our Earth in all respects bottom', says akpobari.

29 miners aged from 17 to 62 years it has been in the zavaleno.
In šachty, where there has been a disaster was triggered by probe, but has no trace for life.
Because of the high concentrations of poisonous gases and the explosions not to go down to the rescue of the security forces.

The horor suited to artistic kinu?
Nicolas winding režisér refn again attempting to overcome the old borders with a battle eposem 'walhalla rising'.
On what the audience about thought the Danish režisér Nicolas winding refn when točil 'walhalla rising'?
Captive vikingský fighter with one eye (mads mikkelsen) are freed from their torturers and wholesale kills almost with supernatural force their adversaries - is that, ideally, for young pánské viewers who are looking for bloody action, because our hero helps to severe methods of killing and its enemies RVE even vnitřnosti of abdomen alive, though it is a bad mood.
On the other hand, jednooký, as in fact is called, during the movie says not a word and other characters pronesou most one or two sentences, or to tear down the painful cries dying people.
Otherwise, the silent and hýří hrůzně beautiful hill landscape in Scotland, which offers kulisu world vikingů about a thousand years ago.
Film is an ideal more for adults attracting more and more enthusiasts into cinemas interested in existencializmus and very quiet images of cameras.
It is good when the film more target groups, it is just a pity that are mutually exclusive.
Režisér winding refn after natočil its wilderness and stylizovanou trilogii on drug dealerech 'pusher', is regarded as the Danish version of the filmmaker quentina stoicky tarantina, but preventing their closer to the mainstream humor either more or less brutality artistic audience.
Most of the arts cinemas is likely to be discouraged everywhere stříkajícím brain and vnitřnostmi.
Supporters of the films, the latest unudí when jednooký has issued from freely vysvětlitelných reasons the group of Christian missionaries backwards ships in Jerusalem and still leaves the ages in bezvětří and fog than perhaps dopluje team to America and increasingly quiet.
So what is it any wonder that in Germany 'walhalla rising' gotten into the country and has now been extradited to DVDs.
This is a pity, mainly because of the beautiful záběrům, but also because, for a special facade, jobs and zborcenou blood is still burying exciting cinema that there could be a little attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or precise, everything is the atmosphere horečnatý dream, which became filmem.
And it is not in favour of a spectator at absconding.
He refn nedopřeje nor the moment the mobilisation and slowly to strangle its mrazivými images and gloomy hypnotickým soundtrackem, but, above all, nepopsatelnou hatred which prýští from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blonďatý boy, which helps jednookému, will retain something like innocence, all the others are poháněni anger.
Of all the most jednooký hero, whose motives are never nevysvětlí, that will be the time for enemies and transitional ally válečníkem from hell, perhaps the envoy of the devil.
It plays havoc, but perhaps also only for those develop rotten.
'walhalla rising' is a shadowy film, which it is possible to hate and admire, for the angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious natural work
The Office for nuclear energy, the IAEA has new warnings on covert nuclear programme in Syria.
But preventing the expression - and nor will control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, similar ideas at least four Israeli combat airplanes F-15 and over čtvercovou building in Syria.
At the Bank euphratu; the bigger city is distant 30 kilometres and appoint the dair as-saur.
In the documents of the International Office for nuclear power (IAEA) is its reputation when it comes to reactor, which allegedly opposed by Syria with North Korea in this čtverci schovaném in the valley, which odbočuje from mainstream.
On the basis of the communication us-americké foreign secret services of the CIA from the end of April 2008, reactor, also known as the near village el-kibar, well, in the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technique of the 1950's to nothing more than a statesman.
The CIA chooses nezaostřenými video with satellite images.
The computer animace clarify where the destruction of which components of reactor could be, it has to be a copy of the North Korean model zmenšenou Yongbyon nuclear centres.
Moreover, were even the photographs also indicated the building or even from within.
The reactor was supposedly shortly before the, but even without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, knows much more than this, even the conundrum of time.
Earlier us-prezident George W. Bush recently in his memoirs, that the CIA has attacked a lot of certain that Syria is building in el-kibar reactor, but basically not groundwork that country finds' active a nuclear weapons programme '.
Some of the rapporteurs of the secret services in Europe are even more cautious and only refers to 'alleged reactor', even though the presentation of the CIA are considered 'ECHO'.
They lack a clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
In the question, as it is certain that has a reactor, replied in the summer of high diplomat UN, the IAEA has supposedly 'sufficient material to put questions'.
Rubble supposedly 'unused military buildings' was syřany rapidly while odklizená and also properly zarovnali terrain.
Nevertheless, we have managed to find in June 2008, the IAEA team under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced.
In addition, the IAEA through Member State satellite photographs of commercial outlets, immediately after the attack, which should be better than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are on the market, because it is exclusively friendly buy unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that should never secret nuclear programme, and avoid reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, to express with Damascus.
But this has been disproved by the IAEA after analysis of particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as satellite záběrech.
In addition, banned revizorům the second inspection in el-kibar and access to the post-Cold rozbombardované buildings.
But Israel remains utterly silent.
'We will never comment on the' official position was confirmed recently at the time of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Investigation of the case, it is fruitless from June 2008 and 'grows into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the office', as acknowledged high Western diplomat in the premises of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, it is a serious breach of the Treaty on the ban on nuclear weapons, to which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers to be the key to moving on the other three facilities, which are to be 'the words' with the alleged reaktorem - and unlike him even exist.
So far, neither did not cite revizoři at which equipment is or how they function or why they are suspicious.
According to information from the newspapers Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah deducted, and, again according to the nearby towns.
An independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS) identified these objects, and found on satellite snapshots complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
Obviously, there are, within or in the immediate vicinity of military bases - it is precisely for this reason that refuses to Syria approach the IAEA on these three points.
In Vienna, said that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that it was sent out by the IAEA in advance to vypátral military bases.
Jaderní detektivové facilities have been alerted to the US secret service.
The IAEA has presented, and also satellite images that between these three places and in euphratu čtvercem transportoval material here and there.
In Vienna, the Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be 'in connection with the fuel production'.
But there is no evidence of senzibilních activities', that is, to enrich uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by a uranium, which is enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where it should secede later plutonium to bomb on these central issues there are only likely estimates.
Also it is not known whether the wreckage of which could conceal the important clues, are shelved in these three places.
It has disappeared from the earth hundreds of costs of freight wagons, nobody seems to have information, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar distant and, on the other hand, euphratu lying salt mines al-tibni, which left Syria checked in 1998 as the storage of radioactive waste, considers the IAEA as unlikely.
The IAEA inspector Robert kelley it gave in connection with reaktorem in one analysis of satellite images for renomovaný magazine Jane's intelligence review.
The images of the universe but show that, after the IAEA demanded approach, carried out by Syria on all suspects places natural work and remove the great kontejnery.
It could be a coincidence, but it does not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, speaks diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months the formation of the roadmap for revizory, which would allow Syria to preserve potential military secrets - only the hardship shows how great is the interest revizorů.
Meanwhile, Syria has rejected this proposal.
If even a year ago uklidňovali Western diplomats in Vienna, that is, the reactor destroyed, and that is why this matter nehoří, speaks for several months, the U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies on the so-called special inspections, which is one of the harsher the funds, which has vídeňský nuclear office on the reinforcement of controls.
The head of the IAEA yukiya Amano to inspections to propose, has already talked about 'options, which will in future agree', but is hesitant.
This choice offers great risks: on the one hand, the necessary majority in the Council the IAEA guvernérské and many of the 35 countries has certainly interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as it highlights one diplomat: 'what will happen if, in the end, nothing doesn?'
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started in the summer to work on still anonymous overheads prvotině, difficulties have arisen.
It wrote scenario, it is about love story of women from Bosnia and men from Serbia.
Much more is yet know - but it also causes unrest.
Persistently talks about the women who are Muslim, zamiluje during the war in Yugoslavia in the Serbian men, which it znásilnil.
The Bosnian female alliances immediately protested, so hastily transpose the planned natáčení from Sarajevo in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary dotočil and is, in bosensku postprodukci but still objects.
Bakira hasecic from the female war victims wrote via un-organizace to assist refugees from the UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with herečkou, now informed the Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also velvyslankyní un-organizace to assist refugees.
It is not just the diplomatic - offer women before the fortnight meeting in Hungary, but rejected.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said hasecic.
In kempech, where znásilňovalo milostné stories have been held there, and the attitude towards the victims of Jolie reveals enough about the scenario.
Its Organisation therefore recommend un-organizaci to help refugees to release as velvyslankyni Jolie, inform the guardian.
What, exactly, wrote Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received to read her scenario, permitted for smaller tug-of-war in Sarajevo natáčení - it is not clear why then Jolie yet nepřijela.
The author emphasises that in his movie does not consider any political intentions, with a great deal of effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia that it wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and all of the parties involved to space.
Given the content remains vague.
On the Internet are one version of the film, which is really quite differently: boyfriends we knew even before the start of the war and again potkají, when she as Bosnia's Muslim zavlečená to the Serbian kempu, where he serves as the guardians.
This really is quite differently, 'the victim of rape zamiluje in its mučitele'.
The fact that the film Jolie really starts before the war - it is true.
Jolie notes that is to come under pressure, which 'is not fair and based on the erroneous information'.
Now it can release is hekeři from Hollywood: by illegally on the Internet will publish its scenario, as it has often done.

The normal practice of Democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as support for private business.
Crime is more worried than unemployment.
Many regions and Brazil considers more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of this survey latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries, and he exclusively friendly in The Economist.
Since the poll held regularly since 1995, it can monitor the change in attitude throughout the areas.
This survey, which took place in September and at the beginning of October, dominated by two related issues.
The first of these is that Latin America is rather a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in a number of countries on the periphery of the Pacific in South America, (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where, since 2002, economic growth averaged 6% per year, increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
We also have increased in Mexico, where economics zotavovala after a deep downturn production in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas are convictions Democrats, which is withdrawing the regional average (see graph 2).
Around 44% of the respondents across the whole of the area, satisfaction, as in their country's democracy works in practice, that is the same figure as last year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it was 25%, it is a huge increase (graph 3).
Approximately 34% said that they trusted the Bundestag in their country and 45% trust the government, and, once again, it is the same figures as last year, but it is a huge difference in comparison with the year 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, undermining democracy in Latin America the economic crisis.
Aid was created during the global financial crisis, probably for this reason that many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have been glad with strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger network of social security has helped to protect poor people.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week announced that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased in 2009, only slightly, and this year once again fell to 32%.)
The mood is turning into a wide range from country to country (see graph 4).
Strong economic performance of Brazil and popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio "Lula" da Silva, reflected in widely přijímaném sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession more serious and worse, the violent crime.
Only the second time since the start implementing the surveys, more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime, rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
Roughly 31% says that either they or their close relatives fallen in the last year of the victims of crime, but it is the decline in comparison with the figure of 38% last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Masivnější economic performance is reflected in the growing support for entrepreneurship and the market economy: approximately 71% across the whole area says that private enterprise is necessary for the development of, this percentage rose from 56% in 2007 (see graph 6).
Around 58% agrees that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their countries, this percentage rose from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela is of the same opinion (and 80% of it promotes private business), even though their left-wing President Hugo Chávez vyvlastňuje many private firms.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the field, as mentioned by 19% (as opposed to 18% in the last year, followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year the year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most powerful country respondents in Mexico and in large parts of Central America, and Venezuela enjoy success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Lamented elections

But they were much worse than outsiders, who has tried to help the affected country, so afraid.
The elections have meant a box and the recurring votes, ballot papers rozmetané after channels, rozbité polling stations and intimidation.
The open after hours of the delay.
Many Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, potulovalo around and trying to find out where they can go to the vote.
Some of them it.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several envisaged předběžců screaming that this is a scam and called for the abolition of the elections.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, has spread to the whole country.
Yet Edmond mulet, a senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, has said that 'in many respects, was a very good choice.'
Observers from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that 'believes that these irregularities, whether they were serious, though not necessarily to abolish the process'.
In other words, the grandstanding continues.
The electoral body, whose voices are obliged, René prévalovi nepopulárnímu the outgoing President and his candidate jude célestinovi, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The anticipated a decisive test is planned for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two prominent opposition candidates, and Michel martelly raper mirlande manigat, the first lady, withdrawal from its original challenges for the vote were declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr célestin, which has little or little support among the voters will be labelled Election Commission for having achieved a decisive contest.
Because řádící cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people, who after the earthquake still living in tents, there were fears that turnout will be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the dezorganizace them has been averted.
Approximately 250 thousand of them identity, which are essential for the vote, shortly before the elections nerozdělené.
The stakes are high.
Donors sees the choice of the legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, therefore, that the Haitians will themselves.
Around to the center
In the weeks when suddenly ovdověla, benefit Cristina Fernández, Argentina's President from public sympathy, its popularity has reinforced from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet reversing this success in a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections can depend on whether truchlící Mrs fernándezová relinquishes rigorous their deceased husband, predecessor and political partner néstora kirchnera.
And on these factors, everything is based.
Mr Kirchner, which entails in economic policy, even after his wife, successfully became President, in the habit of budgeting that downgrading tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This will enable the first couple to spend additional revenue as it pleases.
The government Mrs fernándezové lost last year in Congress majority.
But the opposition was divided and was further destabilised in the death of Mr kirchnera heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the reigning political movement Peronist to join Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (on which there has been a facial and blaming the government of corruption), Congress has failed to approve the budget for 2011.
'I am not going to argue,' said the President.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to the next year, with the President will have more scope to spend as it pleases.
The economy is excessively overheating: this is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now fetching 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists talks about the proposal, which is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, which took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by a string economic collapse, set the priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than to control inflation.
Refused to act with the IMF, the private sector and cleanse zatěžoval indec, statistical agency, which acceded to the monitoring of the official inflation statistics.
It can now fernándezová the moderate this policy?
Called for negotiations between private enterprise and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want in the next year to limit the growth of wages to 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation has rocked the growth based on a devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why, Madam President, that gives fernándezová know wants to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with the holders of the bondholders, who previously rejected the restructuring of debt, which Argentina in 2001 nezaplatila.
Madam President, now faces fernándezová agreement with creditor governments, which are united in the Paris Club, which owes roughly 6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted that this was not to the supervision of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month boudou Amado, Minister for the economy, announced that the Fund will provide 'technical assistance' that has been proposed a new national spotřebitelsko-cenový index, which will remind the introduction to cleaning indec.
It is not yet clear whether the President fernándezová will want to stay in politics after the end of the term of office, if the husband is after its side.
If we want to remain, needs to gain the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
In the returning Argentines of the summer holidays, which have in March, will be a wave of sympathy deteriorate.
If we want to win the next election, it will have to decide whether we will not need to silently waive the many opinions that her husband in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Voters are užšímu taiwanští closer links with the mainland.
What Taiwan thinks about its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 m voters, 70% of eligible, voted for on 27 November Mayor and the Council cities in five urban constituencies, which can be considered a broader evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr President Ma itself is a representative of feeling which is dominated by the land and have a strong commitment in business relations, including the agreement on the part of the free trade in the settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr President Ma has passed the test, but only just.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) came achievement of three of the five offices mayors, failed to win the majority.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence in Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes to 45% of the KMT.
If this were a presidential election should President Ma difficulties.
Since it was elected two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in municipal councils.
The elections took place as most taiwanských elections, which include hlučné election trucks and mass Assembly with vlaječkami with scantily oděnými girls.
Part of his was even compulsory an assassination attempt.
Sean LIEN LIEN chana, honest, the son of the chairman of the KMT was to agitate for candidates KMT on the eve of the elections.
A young man, Mr LIEN purely to face, zranil and killed spectator at.
Bizarně should not be determined whether ozbrojenec intend to hurt the liena or settle dispute with candidate.
In any case, tsai ing-wen, the DPP, says that shooting the election, the suspicion of the DPP and voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was a remarkable, as has remained in the background to the issue of the land.
Instead, the candidates zápolili on the plans for state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually uses its de facto independence and hatred of China's military threats.
The KMT has a tendency to avoid links to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrain from vzbuzování anti-čínských positions.
It is a response to the fact and the realisation that China's trade is of crucial importance for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr President Ma for his party confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for the majority of Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing, we might expect that it will continue to grow in the commercial best, together with its strategies to Taiwan nalákal back into the fold.
China neztrácela time in the sending of negotiators to taipeje to arrange the summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, I would also like to see political integration, but in turn.
It would be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has itself.
Two years ago, at the wrong level: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian was sent into prison on charges of corruption.
The President was in 2000-08 buřič and supporter of clear independence.
But, under the leadership of Mrs tsai developed new generation, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract the experts and young people.
Mrs tsai was provolávána as the list of the DPP president, such as the Suu tseng-changem, which held the office under Mr chenem.
Their party now doing everything possible to demonstrate that it can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that the negotiations can take place without the prior conditions.
Mrs tsai taiwanské tells the public that its side is' a credible alternative 'for a hurried approach of Mr Ma to China.
Mr Chen seems to be angry this drift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the DPP candidates would have done better, if insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
Even ordered the Suu, pragmatikovi not to stand for President.
But even without the intervention of Mr DPP chena will fight the choice between potential candidates.
The KMT is justified for its own people.
The evaluation of Mr Ma were wrong, and despite the rapid rate of economic growth; candidates KMT with it did not want to go into the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT says that přeorganizuje his cabinet, as well as local offices.
Heavily promoted by the proposals to support Taiwan for a rapprochement are restricted.
At the same time, considers that the majority of citizens' taiwanských economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio chianga, immigrant publicisty, 'the point of no return, has already passed.'

Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of the strange bacteria, which can use include arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the scope for finding new forms of life on earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers find an unusual bacterium from here on earth, and says that this is a sign that life has opportunities, which are among the main elements that have been considered and fundamental.
'This organism has a twofold capacity.'
'can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic.'
'This is very strange, but this is not proof that this is a form of truly' mimozemského 'life' comment on this Paul C. W. Davies of the University of Arizona State, a co-author of the report that appeared on Thursday in online edition of science.
For a long time been considered necessary for the lives of the six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and síra.
Scientists discovered that bacteria, discovered in mono lake in California, are able to continue to grow as the include arsenic will replace the phosphorus.
'will begin to wonder what is still possible, "said Ariel D. Anbar from of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This judgement is important for finding life outside the country, because researchers must be able to identify the life and to know how life can be said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on the ground.
However, the report on this novince showed that have been discussed, which details a broad neprozrazovala find speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery mimozemského life.
This is not the case.
The discovery 'shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a series of elements which we regard as' standard ', may not be for life as an absolute necessity,' explained Charles cockell, a professor at planetary sciences and space research institute, open university, Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
'This work is unusual, because it shows the replacement of one element of the other in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure' add cockell.
It was not a random judgement.
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologického Institute in NASA that a study has led to focus on mono lake, since it has a high level of arsenic.
Include arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, thought, therefore, that sustaining themselves, that is subject to the two elements, may be able to replace one after the other.
'include arsenic is poisonous, mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar phosphorus'.
'The result is that organisms can it is very hard to these elements separated.'
', however, include arsenic is so different that, as well as the phosphorus is not working. The organism, begin its work in the biochemical processes' explained Anbar.
Scientists have pooled bacteria known as gfaj-1 and increasing arsenic concentration, which are able to adapt to bacteria and growth.
Microbes are better in the operation of phosphorus, but, given that can survive with a substitute arzenem, increasing the possibility that the form of life, which uses include arsenic, can arise naturally, either in the country or another planet or months ago, which is to include arsenic more normal.
Jamie S. foster, technical assistant mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by fosforem is not new, but they never found an example to this fact was achieved.
Include arsenic was common in earlier times on earth, has said, and as scientists speculated that it could use the pre-existing forms of life.
'This suggests that could be other ways to create life, not only in the way that was created in the early period of the country,' said foster, which was not part of the research team wolfe-simona.
Research has been supported by NASA, the Ministry of energy and the National Institute of Health

Unlike the police, it is these police officers allowed only to promote urban vyhlášku, to impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media normally draw a different reality.
In January 2008 the police inspectors from the provinces Hubei utloukli nezúčastněného spectator at the death penalty, having used their phone to natáčení, both on the intervention in protest against the dustbin.
Last year, police training in Beijing, the guide to this training was being hijacked and placed on the Internet, including manuálu description of how effectively zmlátit perpetrators without the hallmarks of blood.
This year has got podomní obchodník with melouny in Shanghai in brawls with five policemen and suffered injuries to the left of the brain.
One videohra full of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, displays Chinese policemen, as is attacking street retailers.
'chengguan terrorized government' China Daily, national edition naříkala last year after a further discussion on the tactics.
On paper cost 'really thoroughly unclog.'
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district inzeroval in October interest in the eight new female policistek, the editorial in the Beijing evening news to address the issue of whether women have real obligations or are merely withdrawing.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
District demanded female uchazečky aged between 18 and 22 years with a good character and the 'five features faces in the right proporci.'
Adeptky should be setting higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 metres.
Výslužba at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials argue that work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
'their image is an important point, "said one nejmenovaný police officer on rednet.com as government websites.
'nominee must first demonstrate external quality, which then determine the other, these include premiums, weight, features faces, etc.'
Then comes the nature and 'internal quality'.
Women are as květinové vázy, and add 'that will vázami, they will also have other responsibilities.'
Zheng lihua, deputy director of the leadership of the county town, with this description of power.
But point out that the requirements to adjust in normal also for other jobs for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical features faces.
Which means that the good image is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilated surely neuplatní.
'cannot accept that we serve chromý or hrbatý man,' said Mr Zheng.
'his image would not be good.'
Liu Yi, which keeps watch Tiananmen baoguang in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces as jablíčka and gently tvarovaná mouth.
Does the emphasis on its appearance could have sexistický overtones, has said.
'Do you think that, in this uniform vypadám sexy? "asked with ironickým view.
Its mere co-operators with dolíčkama 21-letá Xu Yang says, 'it is our task to represent the image of the cities'.
Do not object to its limited performance, said, because their career ambitions are more than just zahánět traders into uliček where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning is a group of more than 10 trhovcům who pobíhají on foot or rickshaws and trying to sell as many knedlíčků and misek tofu before they are thrown out.
'Mr wangu, must leave. "
'We have heard you say very much!' say miss Xu when he began trhovec run, and in the time left their round with vozíkem with nudlemi.
Policemen describe their obligations as more monotónní than painful.
'every day, it is essentially the same,' said the Huang Jing, 20, which are studying in their vacations marketing.
'The routine'.
One of the reasons is that female policistky have no powers as their male counterparts to goods sellers commandeer.
I can only threaten the fact that they expose their male leadership.
The tendency is to protect them from sudden public hostilities against úřednímu apparatus, which are commonplace throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in kunmingu, the capital Yunnan province, the revolt of having spread false rumours that policisti killed by the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the small hours of the night; 14 government vehicles to be převráceno or zapáleno.
Meanwhile, such violence xindu escaped.
But peace can be guaranteed only hardly.
Only two reactors from the peaceful Tiananmen baoguang where this morning should watch policistky, on the Horn of Africa street gathered more than 50 people.
Policemen seized a motorbike that opravoval on chodníku place inside the supermarkets, as required by the rules.
A round could weep as intended.
15 minutový distance from police officers, with tvářící vztekle lokty against vehicles and quickly gone with motocyklem and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40, coordinator přičleněný to male group remained behind, his White badge historic page had been turned to skrylo his name.
As well as the female policistky, coordinators, men are over 40 years old, who already have only a helping role.
Unlike them are not learned in maintaining and uhlazování image.
'We are sometimes verbally.'
'We are sometimes physically,' said Mr Li openly.
'majority is not public, which will begin with this.'
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator ensigna
Prosecutors Ministry of Justice redeem Senator John ensigna of criminal accusations concerning its affair with the former consultant for campaign and his efforts to make the lobby, announced on Wednesday senátorovi lawyers.
The decision to the most serious legal threat, which Mr Ensign, nevadský a Republican, faced and which was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for President in 2012. His affair into national headline and damaged his career.
The office of Mr ensigna said that the decisions that followed for almost an annual investigation 'certainly pleased'.
Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings for ethical Commission Senate.
The lawyers of Mr ensigna said that the Department of Justice 'has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the aim of the investigation and that there is no plan to raise additional charges against him in this matter'.
The Ministry of Justice, on the case of refused to comment.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who claimed that there are serious evidence that Mr Ensign was a violation of the ban on federal lobby.
The talks, e-mails and other documents which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr Ensign helped douglasu hamptonovi, one of my assistants, to ensure the lucrative lobby, which should lead to silence the hamptona and his wife, is about senátorově ratio with it.
Mrs hamptonová once worked as pokladník ensigna in the campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted many political supporters to find work for Mr hamptona and promoting their views after Mr hamptona recruited to them, so they lobbied documents and talks.
Since the Hampton recently, Mr ensigna asistentem was from the law of lobbying its former employer or the Senate of the year.
Experts on ethics says that unusual settlement of Mr ensigna and Mr hamptona who were the biggest friends, in contravention of the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence, which were published ', it became clear that this is a clear case of the preparation of violations of the law,' said Stanley brand, Washington lawyer who specializes in defence of the clients, who are investigating the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in respect of Senator ensigna, Mr brand and other lawyers, the specialisation of ethics have said that the Treasury is cautious as regards political actions, after a number of setbacks, including the decision of last year to suspend proceedings against former senátorovi tedu stevensovi in the midst of allegations of misconduct State representations.
The Federal Prosecutor 'clearly schovali weapons', said Melanie sloan, Executive Director of the citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington (citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington), the bar group, which tabled in the matter of several complaints against Mr ensignovi.
'this shows in fact that the senior government officials, laws,' to add.
Paul coggins, the lawyer Mr ensigna, in an interview told us that he was on Monday called the public prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice, and then the next day, and say to him that the Treasury neshledalo against his clients no accusation.
Mr ensigna obhajovací team is working with the plaintiff in an attempt to persuade them that senator, as his office ECHO in Wednesday's statement, 'acted in accordance with the law.'
Mr coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments to national representatives.
'I am not pleasant the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, in addition, we think that made the right decision,' he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation of separate complaints in which ethical group gives the accusation that the payment of parents ensigna hamptonům of 96,000 $broke the federal electoral law.
The Commission has said, that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money would break anything other than a gift.
One company, for which Mr Ensign hamptonovi helped to find lobbying work was firm NV energy, the main nevadská company, which for a long time, Senator supported.
One email from December 2008 showed that, having started the Hampton in society to act as a lobbyist, the employees of Mr ensigna - John Lopez - interact with Mr hamptonem and say to him that 'bušil' to the Ministry of the Interior on the subject matter under discussion.
Mr Ensign also engaged in their lunch with Mr hamptonem and other nevadským allegiant klientem, air and call on the minister of transport, so that the meeting he had finished speaking on behalf of the airlines after najmou Mr hamptona on lobbying work.
When last year, for the first time a report on the affair, Mr Ensign apologise to the electorate and resigned on its function as the fourth Republican leaders in the Senate.
After many months' stagnation, Mr Ensign two weeks ago told reporters that it intends to participate in the third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the investigation of crime its spokesperson Jennifer Cooper said that Senator hopes that the Council will be swiftly followed by the Ministry of Justice, and will put an end to the investigations.
'Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing their hard work in the name of nevadského of the people, "she said.
The challenge of the municipalities Cheshire turns to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom have half a dozen written.
A minute by minute sending reports of horrendous testimonies via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140 000 reports on Twitter considered the acts of rape and child přivazováním postelím in the House, which was zapálen.
On Thursday, the trials held Steven J. hayese, which has been condemned for the killing of three citizens Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and should take place with the strongest official closure of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But the lawyers of Mr hayese already submitted an appeal with the Court's requests and arguments that the Court is probably employed years.
One nejprovokativnějších is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter the main reporters - a 'cirkusovou atmosphere of' and the widespread, immediate penetration of information, with inflammatory details then erected porotu in decisions in terms of influencing public opinion.
This would oblige the judges to address the issue of whether, with the arrival of new technologies do not demand new rules in the courtroom.
'as I experienced in the trials, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technologies in the Court affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals, "said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr hayese.
The judge of the process Jon C. blue chief Court state briefly rejected the claims concerning the yield of last week and that the media were 'carefully controlled', and that there is no evidence to show that the jury act under the influence of the public.
But it is not likely to be the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts recognise that reporting notoriously known cases can trigger questions about the fairness of the process.
In the Court of the regulations from 1966 the United States Supreme Court has abolished the condemnation clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr itself shepparda murder of his wife, when in its decision to say that, in the case of sheppard versus Maxwell, is in the process of the media was a 'karnevalovou atmosphere'.
Some believe that this offence was an inspiration television show and film 'refugee'.
Some lawyers say that the courts, which examine hayesův judgment about half a century later, could be surprised by the argument that could be necessary new rules, which will determine the way the direction of judicial síní, which was in the case of Dr sheppard unimaginable.
'There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media' in a highly sought cases, said John J. donohue III, a professor of law Stanford law school, who has studied the death penalty in connecticutu and wrote a report which said that it was exercised arbitrarily.
Professor donohue said that some judges can be pleased with the idea that the restrictions on the immediate communication from the judicial síní can make the process more equitable.
The case of Twitter is only one of many lawyers outlined by Mr hayese, who would be able to argue years to desist from row.
Defenders of, for example, also says that, in the case of Mr hayese can go about bias, when the judge blue refused to enable it to examine the potential porotců by them in the selection poroty shows the criminal photograph nahánějící horror.
Some porotců said that they were horrified at the pictures of the victims, which has become Jennifer hawke-petit, 48, and her daughters hayley, 17, and Michael 11.
Advocates argue that also will reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly dismissed porotce, which was critical of the government representatives and that its decisions incorrectly he used more pressure on the verdict and směroval porotu to think about the weekend.
The judges were decoupled.
But their arguments on the impact of the scale of the process can attract the greatest interest.
In order to combat the verdict vzneseném said last month that the case bestrode the reports in connecticutu and has been discussed during the election campaign candidates to the governor and the Senate of the United States.
Argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly the flames of emotion in this case.
'daily bursts of the media, cameras and reporters before the Court, "wrote the lawyer' was something here in the new havenu not to see, and it is perhaps also the national raritu. '
Their focus on the operation of Twitter is controversial.
In the talks, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later reports and from their point of view, should the police to manage the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers demanded the courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
The lawyers of Mr hayese seek this right.
In their archives, referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 on the judgment of the Dr shepparda, because of the breadth of the operation of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
'this case, "wrote,' is the case Maxwell sheppard versus 21st century. '
Can the courtesy to overcome the gap?
Following the campaign which was remarkable and its urážlivostí negativismem, this week in Washington, there are a small number of courtesy.
This is a good sign of genuine cooperation between the two parties, or only iluzivní moment a rapid return to a party-political struggle in the city?
Úterní negotiations of President Obama and the parliamentary leadership has not brought any major discoveries on the crucial issues which must be dealt with during the sitting.
In any case, but it was a civilised discussion regarding the divergence of views of the two parties, as well as defining their joint responsibility, rather than another empty episode of party-political wrangling.
The public meeting President Jiang's deficit, the Commission was also a civilized, despite our political differences between members of the left.
It seems that it is clear that the close collaboration over a period of several months to build mutual respect, which transcends ideological divide that Members are still divides.
And it is quite difficult to say that to begin a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the early period - sondují other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the borders of public opinion and the electoral patience towards renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also úterní negotiations and its subsequent evaluation of the participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change, which is the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, spending, healthcare or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections has prepared Washington at least quickly.
'It is not a question of whether changed regulatory matters, "said, Bush's pete wehner this, now in ethics and public policy centres.
'They are after the elections.
The election of the party faithful pump up emotions and then utichli.
This is good. '
In a number of issues, particularly those that are to be discussed at the meeting of the Republicans and Democrats, have little chance of finding solutions.
Bush's tax cuts expired at the end of the year, and no one considers favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Just as likely to compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans are unable to see this support tax reductions for the wealthy, while refusing to support the unemployed in unemployment.
After úterním negotiations in the White House is to see greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the opening of the ratification of the new Treaty.
But William Galston from Brookings Institution highlights that the successful cooperation on substantive issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between two political parties, when 112. Congress has called for January.
Rather, it is the likely period of disagreements, or even inevitable, said.
'having to do the things that must be done in the short term, psychology will come back to one of the confrontations,' said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely prevalent - that civility will lead is real cooperation.
'I am looking at all events between now and the year 2012 as the shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012,' he said.
The reasons largely linked to compiling a new Republican majority in the White House and voters čajových parties who helped draft it.
Republican leaders now faces the danger of exaggeration, know that they must behave according to its promises and must reduce spending governments and abolish the new law on healthcare.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the tax code and increase certain taxes, an increase in the retirement age and spending cuts.
Common chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in my view, to press the issue of deficit to the programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
They need but 14 votes in 18-ti členné the Commission to its plan to present a formal recommendation and fought, therefore, that this figure as possible.
The greatest resistance is being elected officials who propose that, in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of a party conflicts, when Republicans urge Obama to solve the budget, taxes and healthcare, to be followed by a period of more partisan cooperation.
What can shift?
Public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that, despite the partisanship during the last elections, most Americans wants to continue to see two sides, which are working.
If we could move towards stalemate, as was the case in 1995, then both sides will be very closely monitored the public reaction.
Anyone threatening to reduce the votes, will probably rate and will seek a compromise.
This may be optimistic view of the matter.
Partisanship of and guidelines are now more than has been the case in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that the more ideological divide between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than was the case in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, the activists on both sides see the year 2010 as a prelude to the important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the courtesy which occurred this week, would have liked to see many Americans.
This will be a state but many efforts on both sides, in order to find common ground on issues which are still divided.
Vyzrazený American document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The management of cities is in the hands of the 'kleptokracie' and it continues parts of bribes and bribes for the protection of that is the way to kremlinu, give us embassy in Russia in the recording of February.
The police, and the Federal Security Service largely holds protective wings, which help to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from the legal trade but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called 'vertikála office' - take their money when they begin to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of John beyrleho ambasadora was on Wednesday published by WikiLeaks on their websites.
It is based on resources, whose names were redigována.
It was written in a time when he was still mayor Yuri Luzhkov, accusing it of a large share of corruption.
It was lifted in October the President Dmitry medvedevem but, since we can see only minimal changes in očistě.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena baturina that owns prominent construction company, for many years, always denounced the accusations of corruption, and won a number of actions for křivé charges for such accusations.
In September, he said on Russian television station, when he was asked to the proven testimony of corruption: 'It is crazy, it is špína, it is svinstvo.'
The Russians with absolute conviction believes that if their company corrupted, it will show it to the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details vyřčenými in such a way, and that in ambasádní report, and it is also unspeakable that it would do so diplomats from foreign countries.
'the Government of the city of Moscow and its links with criminal elements some have led to question' dysfunctional, 'and confirms that the government works more like, as a government,' says the report.
'criminal elements it enjoys the so-called' krysha ' (deadline from the world of prison and the mafia, which literally means' roof 'or protection), which gives them the police, the Federal Security Service, Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as elsewhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
'analysts identified and třístupňovou structure in the criminal world of Moscow.'
'Luzhkov is at the very top.'
'the Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are at the second stage'.
'and, lastly, the lowest degrees are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors.'
'It is ineffective system in which criminal groups are filling the empty jobs in some areas, because the city of certain services.'
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest companies and police focuses on smaller businesses.
One source said, 'owners of shops in Moscow recognize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organised criminal groups), since not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.'
'for this reason for protection from criminal gangs is not so in the course.'
It says that while the choice of money is comprehensive, protecting itself may have difficulties; and what is true, can sometimes be arrested.
Those who does not quickly enough, their shops under various pretexts are closing.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but that has made little progress.
The report talks about men ambasádní beroucích bags, probably napěchovanými kremlinu cash, governments in itself.
'in its fight against corruption must be Medvedev rely on the bureaucrats, "said in a recent interview Georgy satarov, Director of Moscow's research team indem.
'but it is part of this bureaucracy.'
'It is not part of the political classes, because Russia has the political classes exist.'
Without politicians, without opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable.
Indem estimates that nationwide costs of corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
Countries are at 154. place in a recent survey on the global corruption perceptions of non-governmental organisations watchdog (countries are ordered from at least for the most corrupt).
The discovery of the reports of American embassies in Moscow appeared until late in the day certainly did not provoke the Russian Government enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Moscow's shortcomings can be charged Luzhkov, it may be for Kremlin opportunity to argue in terms of resolving the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry kingem told Putin that the documents published by WikiLeaks could be counterfeit and responded rozzlobeně on the statement that American diplomats call Batman and medvedeva Robin.
'The truth of the matter is that this is about our mutual collaboration, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country, "he said.
'But, to be honest, nedomnívali we are that this will be done with such arrogance, such coercion, do you understand, so neeticky.'
Veterans of the Khmer khmérů are forced to come to terms with the past
In scantily osvětlené concrete učebně zašpiněnými oloupanými walls and to remind the director of the schools anlong veng high school men, which it has built, the leader of the Khmer Rouge that Mok.
'all of us who love the moka.'
'was a good leader and ensuring their people, "said sreng KOR Ma, 42.
What is known as' a butcher 'for the vileness during the Khmer Rouge, remains the commander in this remote državě the Khmer Rouge in the north-west of Cambodia, which has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where there are still thousands of former soldiers of this organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered government is nabouraná prolonged loyalty in anlong vengu.
In April, the victims in the forum of the truth and reconciliation allowed publicly to confront with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government has provided textbooks, which for the first time children explain the history of the Khmer Rouge, and their former soldiers.
And in July to raise together the United Nations and Cambodia's Court of First condemnation of the former Member of the Khmer Rouge, the overturning of the former leader of the notorious thuggish associations Tuol Sleng, Kaing khek známějšího iev, as the spirit to 35 years.
With every such progress had been increasing unrest among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in anlong veng, which complicates the efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to engage in Cambodian society.
'between the former Khmer Rouge is resentment and fear, but they are powerless to do anything, "said chhang youk, leading documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
'the life of the Khmer Rouge marvellous, but the regime has become a symbol of the evil'.
'allocates a family'.
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people executed or died of hunger, disease or recasting.
When the Vietnamese Government assaulted and overturn the Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Start the insurgency, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary Islamists of guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles in West Cambodia, while the Mok kultivoval supporters in anlong vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was held for the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of the Khmer Rouge to switch to the government, which culminated in kapitulací Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and the latter Mok, who stayed in 1999, he was kidnapped by government forces in nedalých mountains dangrek.
Phnom penhském died in prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons to them nepečovali, most of the former combatants Khmer Rouge already gone down to the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them cast a nostalgic recalls a period of movement.
Although a few elite of the Khmer Rouge preserves its local government's position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
'They should surrender a minimum benefit, "said leang shock of the Center for justice and reconciliation, which leads the public forum for the whole of Cambodia, including anlong vengu.
'They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology of the regime'.
'were vychování without any notion of implementing trade'.
Sor Lim, 55, which came to rudým khmerům as teenager in 1974, he fought in the jungle around anlong vengu before settle as a poor farmer in 1998.
'life under the Khmer Rouge was good, "said.
'This Mok all sustenance.'
But now it is life difficult, because everything we need to safeguard ourselves. '
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge also provoked fears.
At the beginning of next year will be the Court to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The Court has a mandate to prosecute leading přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but it was not mentioned, whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was a little, in order to calm the fears in anlong vengu.
The recent speculation of the media focusing on im chaema, 64, who was the leader of a regional integration in the province banteay meanchey during the Khmer Rouge at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007 the stated aims of the documentation centre in Cambodia that oversees the construction of dams trapeang thma, project, which probably killed thousands of workers.
The recent parný afternoon im chaem returned from work in the field of the House on its dřevěného dirty road outside anlong veng.
As the sun started sestupovat and there were shadows over the arid grass, im chaem refused to talk about their past between the Khmer Rouge.
If the Court have called it, rejected it.
'in Cambodia is governed by peace and is stable,' she said.
'If they emerge further prosecutions, is war'.
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who přeběhl from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there will be instability, if the Court to seek other suspects, although with the experts and historians.
'Cambodia must vykopat deep hole and to bury it in the past,' he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what must be done to move forward in Cambodia, said chhang youk of documentation centres.
'reconciliation in khmerským circumstances means to cobble together smashed pieces,' he said.
'It is our duty to give these rozbité pieces together, so that we can understand.'
The Centre has issued the first textbook endorsed by the government of the Khmer khmerech has 75 parties and the title 'The history of a democratic Cambodia.'
It was distribuovaná in anlong vengu in June as an addendum to the textbook history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides of the Khmer khmerech.
Like many people in Cambodia, as well as young people in anlong vengu knew only a few details about the Khmer khmerech, despite the combination of cities with the regime.
Touch valeak, 19, student in secondary school in anlong veng said that new textbooks helps students to understand the important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically, when took home book to study.
'My family refuses to many parts of textbooks and courts,' he said.
'are suspicious, because we are not sure how many people will be the Court to prosecute.'
Such opposition is the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, shock leang.
But public forums, textbooks and justice are beginning to have an impact.
The Khmer Rouge, there are still strong charm.
Up in the mountains dangrek mountains is the way zarostlá weed-infested and vysypaná odhozenými plastovými packets, which leads to obdélníku of black soot, pokrytého zrezivělou plechovou střechou.
The body Pol Pot here have been burnt down on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, 31 prodavačka mobilů on the fringes of roads, said that he did not know much about men, who was the zpopelněn.
'but it has a strong spirit, many of the local people here walking and praying to him,' she said.
Nuom sothea should birthday and in the later visit the rest of Pol Pot, where will the Union of mature bananas, in the hope that it will bring happiness.
Belarus agrees that their stocks of weapons on the basis of uranium.
In did with its surprise victory in the campaign of President Obama on the safeguarding of nuclear material around the world, announced by the Government of Belarus on Wednesday that give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in the joint statement issued after the security summit, the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister sergeiem Martynov.
The American government has for years sought to persuade Belarus to surrendered highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the stumbling block discovered last spring.
But American officials have said the Washington Post that in the last two months, with Belarus carried out a few clandestine operations in order to eliminate 187 pounds weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research facilities.
It has prepared the ground for the agreement to eliminate the rest of material - approximately £500, according to the official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement has shown itself to be one of the most important results of the Obama 47. national summit on nuclear safety in April, which was Belarus be removed.
And it was probably a good move to the invitation of the former Soviet republics in the subsequent summit in 2012.
'I was really fascinated by the fact that they want to place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012.'
'This shows that this process works, "said Ken luongo, President of the partnership for global security, the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement as a 'very major, important step' from Belarus.
Obama has promised in Prague in April 2009 that will ensure that all the sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world in four years.
Since then, the American government has helped the six countries get rid of all its stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Ten countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the summit on nuclear safety announced Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that his nation will never give up its uranium.
'We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially a basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium, "said then Lukashenko.
'It is our commodity... we are not going to produce dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell.'
'we use it only for research purposes, that is all.'
Belarus, however, a few months ago acceded to the United States and we have an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly ozářen, announced the bureaucrats.
It was naložen on special train travelled more than 1 300 million in the Russian facilities for the storage and disposal, said the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, said the officials.
The US government for the programme it has spent 13 million dollars, most of it on the delivery of Belarusian research institute less enriched uranium, which is not appropriate for the production of nuclear weapons.
'Everything has been zkoordinováno very carefully and conducted on the basis of trust', which led to an agreement signed Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, the servant of the Department of Energy's working for a global nuclear reduction effort.
James Martin centres for studies on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year odhadovalo that Belarus has a minimum of 88 pounds uranium applicable for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration to remove their reserves by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have for years strained, primarily because of the lukašenkově brutal repression of human rights.
But the statement suggests the possibility of gradual thaw.
'We welcome the progress made in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its population, "he said.
The Spanish Government did with the CIA flights drahoty
The Spanish Government did drahoty on CIA flights carrying trapped talibance Al-Qaida and Members to Guantánamo via the Spanish teritorium, as expressed in its telegramu Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This stems from the documents provided by WikiLeaks serverem newspaper El País, which also writes that the first representative of Prime Minister María Teresa fernándezová de la vegová request that the Spanish executive informed, and thus to show that there is proper supervision of foreign aircraft prolétajícími Spanish air space '.
In June 2006, following the communication from the Council of Europe, in which the ten States, including Spain on charges of complicity in the violation of human rights, we held a meeting between the Ambassador of the USA eduardem Aguirre and fernándezovou de la vegovou.
As the Prime Minister said that the message of the Council of Europe 'vyňalo the Zapatero government from the Games' and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la vegová stressed that Spain does not have a problem with the flights of the secret services across its territory.
'simply want to be informed' in order to 'zastiženi off-hand', tells Aguirre in one of the documents.
Also, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos has indicated the American Ambassador, that the Spanish government 'I give this issue the lowest possible contours, but the fact that this matter has been in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited potential influence'.
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that, if his concerns, does not intend to block the initiative of judges to apply odtajnění received the national centre of the secret services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
'the information they contain no inkriminovanou component of any sensitive information' vysvětlilo embassy after conversation with prokurátorem.
Nevertheless, the US expressed concerns rather because of the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors' than for odtajnění information CNI or Defense Department.
'This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to tackle this case discreetly between governments' regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of their lunch the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez rubalcaby, told the ambassadors', that although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what will be considered appropriate ', commissioned has instructed its associates' avoid rozohněným comments with the intention of reducing tensions'.
The Ambassador also expresses its concern about the political parties of the Partido Popular (PP; česky People's Party - massive fly-tipping in this matter.
'despite its popular pro-American orientation of our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to use any signs that zapaterova government tolerated or deliberately ignored the negotiations the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and even in the event that these revelations could have negative consequences for the government of the United States' notes.

The PP would have gained in the Chamber 4 seats and PSC (the Socialist Party of Catalonia - massive fly-tipping would lose 9 mandates.)
With the results of 28 November, the PP may have the floor for municipalities in léridě, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the number of votes and experienced parliamentarians during the recent autonomous elections katalánská PP (the People's Party of Catalonia - massive fly-tipping already has the image of the election general, whether there will be increased or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually one such relative to the elections katalánských.
In 2008, gained katalánští the PP in the general election 610.473 votes, while in the election of the autonomous from 2006, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, gained the PPC (the People's Party of Catalonia) 384.091 voice.
If this tendency increases, which was supported by transferring votes from PSC and loyalties of voters, analysts PP Party have calculated that, if the elections, the PPC could gain 12 Members in the House compared with current 8, party ciu (Convergencia even Unió česky agreement, and the Union - massive fly-tipping would gain also 4 mandates (now it has 10) and PSC would have lost at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia has for the PP and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) is of fundamental importance.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (left-wing Republican Party of Catalonia, massive fly-tipping lost one - now has 3 - while icv (initiative of the Greens for Catalonia - massive fly-tipping should remain a mandate, or would gain one another.
However, in the parliamentary calendar will take the earliest dostaveníčko held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the PP could also have a decisive influence on the domination of the Socialists in four major provincial towns and also to changes in the Council of Barcelona (diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the projected budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the PP coincide with the possibility that PSC could lose the municipalities in Barcelona, Tarragona, and geroně léridě where Socialists have not received a majority and not resort to its traditional allies, the ERC and icv.
Given the debacle of the Republicans would not be impossible if the party has lost its representation in the Barcelona zastupitelstvu - because it is necessary to get at least 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, léridě and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turnover, Tarragona, where essentially, together with a party to the PP before the current mayor, josepem félixem ballesterosem.
In léridě gained the PP only about 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with marianem rajoyem - during the last campaign on several occasions met.
The PP gained also on other major municipalities, such as badalona castelldeels or reus.
Currently the PP representation of 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would create a candidate in the maximum possible number of municipalities.
Katalánská cell has provided the al-Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, were detained another three in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one nigerijec detained agents of the information komisařství in Barcelona, jihadi cell managed from Thailand, which zařizovala passports different groups of Al-Qaida, among whom were also 'tigers Liberation Tamil Eelam' or 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', and the second group was the author of the assassinations in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches to investigate this matter of great importance, aims to ensure through the 'operation kampai' weakening padělatelského apparatus Al Qaeda at international level and 'limit and its operational capacity'.
Investigators estimate that the cell might within two years, when it was in Catalonia, send thousands of passports in Thailand, where then are counterfeited and then dodávány groups, which are criminal galaxii Al-Qaida to their 'combatants' impunity can travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active, the network of jihad in Europe, and that is why these investigations in addition to buoyant services in another European police forces, and cannot be ruled out that in the next few days will not happen in other European countries to similar interventions, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when they were detained Pakistanis, junaid humayun atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan begum, tanveer arshad and nigerijec babatunde agunbiade) in Thailand is developed further in which they were captured by the Pakistanis Mohammed athar butt and zeeshan Ehsan butt and thajec sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
It was precisely those men who commanded the Bangkok cell residing in Spain and in other European countries.
Katalánská network, which was wound up in 2009, kradla especially tourists passports, which comply with the requirements of the Islamists.
This means that documents have to be men aged 25 to 45 years, have had to have a force for several years and be without vyznačených visas.
In the investigation documents is pointed out that are not yet aware of any facts that would be linking detainees from Catalonia with that in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', should be one of the groups that adopt passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that, a few days before this that has been sent from Catalonia transfer by about $1,000, which were 'inserted' on the purchase of cards to mobile phones, which later were used by the members of the 'commandos', which killed 106 people.
The police have already have seized many evidence.
People's Party (PP) demanded masovi to stop a fiscal agreement
The Chair of the PPC (the People's Party of Catalonia) alicia sánchezový-camachová had the opportunity to present yesterday, Mr masovi their conditions under which it is willing to support its arrival in office of President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to stimulate the economy and the renunciation of risky enterprises such as economic agreement, which wants to the leader of the nationalists to propose during your mandate.
The President of the people's katalánských has arrived at a meeting with arturem meat with the certainty of the 18 MEPs of the seats received in elections last Sunday, which is no more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the candidate ciu needs to have at least one of the formations that make up the opposition abstained from the vote on the appointment of his office.
To be consistent with the PP depends future alliance, which would like the nationalists in this House to keep to the general election, but so far the talks which leads in these days of the masses with the rest of the political leaders in Catalan spirit.
As regards the President PP to win its support for the functions' will have to put an end to all the sovereign and liberation speeches', as well as with economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque country - which I leader ciu even to vote in a referendum.
The two leaders would like to slim down rampant political apparatus autonomous administration and to reduce the estate and darovací taxes.
The details of the negotiations concerning masova the functions to be addressed within the framework of the PP and Jordi cornet dolors Montserrat.
Masses already met joaquinem nadalem (PSC), who promised to the hard opposition joanem herrerou (icv) and today meets with joanem puigcercósem (ERC), Albert riverou (ciutadans) and joanem laportou (solidaritat catalana).
The Director geriatrického equipment assures that deaths occurred as a result of the 'lack of measures'
The presentation of the center olot exclusive that their pečovatel killed more than 11 clients
Leadership geriatrického centres la caritat de olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to vylíčilo what damage caused the institution of criminal behaviour Joana dilmé villas, carers who - mezitímco has been employed - killed at least eleven of the elderly, which should in care.
The Director of the homes for the elderly, Joan sala come by a lawyer, a lawyer Joana canady, and announced that 'the wishes of the home of the La caritat would be able to make accusations against viníkovi' responsible for killing, but 'legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process, the relevant authorities'.
In addition to the damage to the reputation of this institution suffer due to the fact that, in time, revealed the criminal activities of carers, a major threat to the homes of La caritat are now the requirements for material compensation, which have already been calculating legal representatives of families pozůstalých.
Joan Vila dilmé confessed that his first udál crime is already in August 2009, and that since then nepřestal kill
The judge has ordered exhumaci eight of the bodies of the clients of homes for the elderly with the suspicion that, in many cases, the deceased neprohlížel no doctor, personally, but that, given the age and health of patients - everything vyřizovalo telephone.
La caritat yesterday through its director resolutely rejected this extreme and underlined that 'the lack of measures could not be in any case, the cause of which occurred'.
A legal representative la caritat add that 'in case there are no indications that, in addition to its own accused any third person has tolerated misconduct'.
A man nicknamed now 'Angel of death' admitted yesterday 11 killing and made it clear that the first crime was on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed the second stařenku.
In this case, the presentation too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case, when a mixture of comforting tabletek.
The Director of the La caritat to say that it is difficult to control access to staff medikamentům.
Inzulín and cocktails sedativ were probably in six cases of nine means by which this pečovatel užíval to patients killed in their efforts to relieve their suffering.
But analyses which are currently taking place in the laboratory, should show whether Vila that does not lie and, indeed, for its first victims less cruel death or are killed publicly louhu, as already acknowledged in the case of three women were killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat zdravotníkovým claims and believes that the number of those killed or exclusive can be higher than what is acknowledged, and to justify their behaviour in different versions, by Vila court with the knowledge that must change its behaviour, when it became clear that killed eight people.
I therefore say that they want to be available to the judiciary to be osvětlen the scale of this matter.
The European Central Bank risk
Investors yesterday sharply responded to yesterday's threat of the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who pointed out that 'markets should not underestimate our ability to react'.
The peripheral diferenciály are closed and shares the European banks have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also underestimate the capacity of the European Central Bank to err - the euro is increased over critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market that, although the downturn is recovering - but because of the brief and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose their concerns.
A month ago the European Central Bank quote that today reverses the level of liquidity and, tomorrow, we will have to have for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank has called for an end to the plan for buying up the national debt for the ineffectiveness and the elimination of all the extraordinary levels of liquidity in the deadline and unrestricted access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the level of liquidity forecast 'at least until March' and keep the three-month licitaci with unlimited access to the end of this trimesters, so as to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue its programme of buying bonds, and even to announce its intensification.
Nenaplní-li created expectations, again the reaction of the markets of yesteryear, and will continue to blindly continue the withdrawal rates of liquidity, God with us!
The same at the Congress in May, which argued that neither neuvažovali on the purchase of bonds and the collapse of the markets - tomorrow could history to repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and sustained.
In May, it has announced pancéřová fist on Monday, and on Wednesday, I note that many of them are already purchased, provoking a further breakdown of the market.
Yesterday's auctioning holdings in one year in Portugal has been very poor.
El tesoro issued only 500 million with 5,28%, compared with 750 million with 4.81% from the previous one.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points, and a change in market sentiment odrážejíce the words of Trichet.
In Ireland was published figures are losing allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amount roughly 10,000 million on short-term securities, and other potentially 15.000 in February have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, in July, a problem nor stresovými tests sums are in the framework of the support plan acceptable and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday will need government to gain the approval of a new budget Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so in Ireland remain a uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has reduced the tone of your speech, to release the tensions in the face for the next meeting of the leaders of the EU held on 14 December, in which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are a Union, and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer beethovenovu ódu to joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister yesterday to present the plan of action which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, the reduction in the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to stimulate employment - into uší investors that sounds like a four year period from vivaldiho.
A dual effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, which is double than other European bourses.
Unlike the February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish national banks, rapid and convincing - perhaps we are benefiting from the effect of surprises.
Today, we have a key licitaci bond for three years, which is becoming a beneficiary effect Trichet, which, we hope, it will be a great demand, which will help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinancing.
Asking for a rescue plan for Spain self-sacrifice.
Given the cash that we do not need - in El tesoro is available 40.000 million in cash, three times more than in March - on high tariffs and access to the markets, we concluded a sine die.
However, it is important to continue to use the strategy cesarovy women - 'not only vowed, but also by zdáti'.
We can do it.

Apelace to judge it is to resolve the dispute the only legal means, which stipulates convening of the Commission.
The final step, Juan Carlos, pabla Emilia, Marty and elviry álvarezových mezquirizových considers David Álvarez for 'forlorn means of his five children serving through judicial stratagems and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of 18 January, which was totally invalid. "

Be prohibited from mixing Red Bull looks triumphant in the Formula 1 with the secret weapons from Siemens
Software is proposing improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since be prohibited from mixing Red Bull vpadnul into the Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world speed is defined surprise and success.
Nobody initially been taken very seriously the possibility of this newly příchozího team, and despite an upward trend in recent times, all bet heavily on the triumph of the Ferrari Fernando alonsa.
Unless we want to reduce the riding capacity champion, the Germans sebastiana vettela, or the possibility of an engine of Renault, which is driven by his car in the world Formula 1 was born legend - 'secret weapon', which, in the hands of the multinational Siemens red bullu that it did so winning team.
This is, in fact, the executive software simulující Marches, which the German company has said on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very distant motor sport.
The so-called plm, this powerful software device is used to draw up the assembly lines in manufacturing plants throughout the world, in energy plants and for appliances with a high degree of accuracy.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate process earlier than is actually created, so that we can avoid the unnecessary mistakes and spending.
Plm facilitate development fotoaparátu canon, aircraft spent or the iconic commercial vehicles branding Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, leading industrial divisions Siemens, explains that the application of this team softwarového appliances to be prohibited from mixing Red Bull to 'within a few hours, almost real-time' modifications and improvements, which are otherwise detekují during plants and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 employed stables an average of 10 engineers who were able to carry out a maximum of three or four improvements over a period of time.
The team to be prohibited from mixing Red Bull works today to 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with an efficient information technology, analysing and proposing every type of modification závodních vehicles.
Leading from Siemens explained that software plm is able to analyse and improve all elements závodních be prohibited from mixing Red Bull with the exception of motor vehicles, which is fully accountable to Renault.
In, respectively, material, fuel, aerodynamika and safety elements.
The changes it is possible to transfer from the virtual realities in fact, in less than 24 hours because of advanced production systems through laseru and highly technologically advanced autokláv.
The only limit the technical achievements of a sum of $40 million, which represents the best that everyone can spend a formula for every period to improve their competitiveness.
Be prohibited from mixing Red Bull establish roughly 50 km from London high-tech plant for the design and production of their závodních vehicles.
These are two buildings, which is limited by the entry going - especially journalists.
What is happening here is regarded as the 'great secrecy'.
The list zúčastěných this project constitutes 580 people, including two pilots - champion vettela and mark webbera.
The hero bullu red is the Formula 1 without doubt a fresh champion Sebastian vettel.
For nezměrnými technological means that the label of energy drinks inserted into their participation in závodních headings, however, masks other protagonists, whose aid is priceless, and no one knows.
The head of manufacturing technology Steve nevey argue that, five years ago, it was impossible to say that the advances in research and the development of vehicles contribute to the victory of 50%, and the rest was due to Horsemen.
At present, this ratio changed and technology behind the achievements of the 85%, while the pilots contribution of 15%.
Nevey recognises that vettel webber will never be replaced or computer technology, because they are 'nepředvídatelní gladiátoři'.

Indeed, we believe that the way out of the crisis in Spain 'will be lengthy'.
In addition, it will be for two or three years' very difficult to create employment ', which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, to add.
And although it believes that passive war - which reduces margins - is retreating, price přirážek for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity, have migrated to the price of credit, thereby compensate for the reduction in the margins.
'The subject of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit'.
'We have to conclude tap, but diferenciály are very high, "recognized guardiola.
BANESTO already issued its network on Thursday orders, to reduce long-term loans and increased prices diferenciálů - see cincodías of 22 and 27 November.
Also realises that trends in the banking sector 'now is reducing the Commissions', but there is a 'competitive framework'.
The strategic plan is based on bank sabadell once growth, but as usual group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for nothing have an assurance that in Spain 'will require greater size'.
'the next year will be left to erase cornerstone', assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are much reduced 'and' does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between the red figures.
And it highlights that the market can frob suplovat collection of funds from the new measure of capital.
After the assurance that sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, remains a serious problem, as some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes the next wave of mergers loan crises
The Director-General CECA refused yesterday that should emerge from another wave of mergers loan crises, and once again insisted on the speed with which it implements the reorganisation of the sector.
When we started the process of association, the Spanish loan crises, there were a couple of institutions that ujišťovaly that this first phase of the ceremonies and wait for the second round.
However, the director of the Spanish Confederation loan crises (CECA) José Antonio is olavarrieta yesterday ruled that there should be a new wave of these operations.
'I believe that the majority of mergers has already been carried out, inkorporaci cajasolu into the Banca cívica cannot be considered a second round, what happens is the Convention'.
'The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that, instead of 17 institutions will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish national banks in this matter, which has cooperated very well, "said the director.
In their statements at the meeting adea (association of senior officials and Executive aragonu massive fly-tipping olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is' the highest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied, as it has in installments, which at the time, not now appeared in a business plans with the Spanish National Bank ', pointed out.
'move from 45 loan crises, with an average of assets 28.000 million to 17, 75.500 million is a process that is unparalleled in the history of comparisons, and the number of institutions redukujíce to 62%, so that these have been greater, and thus in line with the Basel Treaty', to underline that point.
Olavarrieta realises that 'there are a number of not very fortunate views on the slowness of the process', which show 'lack of seriousness and of understanding', 'What does the Spanish national bank is reminding that we must be before the end of the term'.
The Director-General CECA José Antonio is olavarrieta yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and 'possibly' and in the world, and those who cast doubt on this, awarded 'lack of knowledge'.
The director remarked that, in the current positive economic situation 'can be assured' with regard to the financial institutions and loan crises and a system that has sufficient resources' very important 'process of concentration and which continues' the highest possible rate '.
We also recall that the Spanish banking became very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set out the conditions for the whole of the Union.
The tension on the markets of a dual government answer.
On the one hand, proposed by José Luis Zapatero, a new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private zprostředkovacích 426 agencies or the abolition of the euro for the unemployed without benefits, after the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control - massive fly-tipping, administrators of airports Barajas Airport and El Prat and 30% state lotteries.
Vice-President Elena salgadová with the promotion of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the criticisms of the Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret this pohnutí?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel is wrong in its communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process redefinice the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what is to be its future, which runs the idea of respect for the old traditions, which holds a large part of the other Members.
In the face of the European resistance in Germany starts to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of these is the strength of the euro area, which would be just Germany but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states have abandoned the monetary zone.
The second is a return to the Deutschmark now - although this may seem scifi, this version has broad public support, the impending 50% of the population.
The third option is the German proposals for the revision of the euro with greater macroeconomic control, budgetary severity, penalties for the guilty states, possible delays of payments for some of them, and with the enlargement of the possible costs on the regulation on the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has already been some time defines, so there is no room for quibbling now.
First of all, when, in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission should encourage the deficits basement has pulled from the German Government constitutional reform in order to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first indication of the contradiction between what it considered Germany for the right (plans fiscal stringency and stability of public finances), and what praktikovali its European partners, including France.
The second has shown that a Central European country, when Merkel painfully protahovala decision on the rescue of Greece.
Then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in last October's days, Merkel has a clear position, as demanded by the reform of the conventions of the European Union so as to enable the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, to enable private creditors to bear some of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as was precipitated by the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although in a somewhat zmírněné form, was approved and, over the next few months, we should monitor the process of reform of the Union, which should from 2013 to enable these measures.
Germany took a red line that it does not intend to go.
And all the commentary tells us that, although it is now necessary to take measures which probably too, since that date will be the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of the new currency zone in which the Member States will be infringing the rules hard sankcionovány and can be forced to report the postponement of payments and the private sector must also bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to give a strict way to growth, increasing the degree of saving and investment, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Choice based on claims was and building, with vast loopholes in the balance of payments which prevailed in the booming years of growth of Spain, simply not going to tolerate.
Supply is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we fail.
It is not only about the resumption of the public deficit of 3% in 2013.
What we want is harsher.
And the worst thing is that, under these conditions, we can state that alone zmýlíme.
I hope that these will replace the current turbulence more calm.
And that we will use the opportunity given to the spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood and its dual statement (reforms promised, after a meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) it suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, opening the way to the idea that it is necessary to put things right.
But the red line that Germany took, is here, and would like to move.
And the possibilities which can be considered, we cannot abandon the euro area full of not very reliable countries ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to say that the US varovalo.
Sport and the circumvention of the Rules
What showed finty Alonso and Ramos in the struggle with ajaxem savvy, show not the intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly contrived exclusion of two players also undermined export competitiveness Madrid (xabiho alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the struggle against ajaxu Champions League of 23 November meant that it was vypsáno sea brushes about whether this is or is not nesportovní behaviour, and whether eventuelně UEFA had both footballers to punish.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the struggle (who had their team clearly vyhraný) state-appointed players one after another deliberately losing time when it was playing being so vyprovokovali sudího, and they show the yellow card.
In this way, the two players meets the requisite punishment in the struggle against auxerre - with real Madrid ends in my group led - and will be able, deprived of cards, go into the next phase.
Finally, a disciplinary board UEFA trenéru José mourinhovi sentence of two matches, but guilty players received money fined.
The provocation of yellow card for similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules which are an unwritten, but are.
Part of the debate in this case arose due to the fact that its presence was a team of real Madrid (which, in its anthem šlechetností trumpet and honour, and which has already for similar actions of their player pokutoval) and, it seems, also with dramatizaci led mourinhem, which thus adds to its long history, komedianta and provokatéra another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of behaviour, which is not the rules explicitly banned, is in conflict with the principles of sport, whether in these deeds are to circumvent the law; it is, in fact, the actions of respecting sporting rules, whose purpose, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
With what type of damage such negotiations, sport spirit.
One of the formalities of sports behaviour is physical inviolability protihráčů, which has not been violated in these cases, there has been no violent game.
Another of these formalities that characterise clean game is avoided that, thanks to the offence towards team opponent advantage - and this also happened.
Therefore, the paradox of action players also undermined export competitiveness Madrid is the fact that this did not happen, as normally charakterizujeme as deceit or circumventing the law, not the overt infringement of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this should be the most noticeable, with the aim of obtaining a sentence.
Wait and punishment.
The other question is, however, what benefit the culprits of wilful offence will have.
Here it must be said that the competitor lacking in disadvantaged position, and that, in the current struggle will have no benefit, as an obvious consequence is that the team itself, will have fewer players.
And nor is it useful strategy to another struggle, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage of having clearly lies in the fact that the players to begin the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the future game.
But it is the advantage of the long-term perspective and with a certain degree of neurčitosti, at first sight, the team can be eliminated, and this process will odbudou players punishment, and switch to the second round of the cards, to the exclusion of just one card less than in the first round.
So how will the wheels continue, not very clear whether the advantage.
In short, the negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, which is to make strategic decisions which will make it possible to gain maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the case that we are dealing with here, not players to avoid granting the death (which would have been a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chosen when it has to.
Make strategic decisions without avoid the death or before they ran.
Although it is not the borders between resourcefulness and by bypassing rules quite clear, I believe that, in this case, it was a savvy.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two samovyloučení and because of the way it was the transfer of instructions to their provocation from the leadership.
Damage to the sporting principles of these actions is less ethical as aesthetic.
The fight offers on the holding of Christmas parties in Barcelona
Diktat calendar concentrated this year a spate of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
Rapidly increasing the celebrations, all the workers who want to spend between 20 and 30 of the euro.
As well as the Turkish MED or lotteries, with the arrival of the December once again come pre-Christmas street parties that still operate as kyslíková bomb for restaurants and equipment for their free time in Barcelona, but the crisis resulted in the fight to win the clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants for food to spend 20 to 30 of the euro are dotázaní entrepreneurs and associations in the sector.
To complete hitch abundance, zkoncentroval calendar this year (when Christmas was on Friday) the request for a week since 13 December, there was a flurry of reservations on the days to peak (16 and 17), whereas in the previous week was almost no traffic.
As has happened since 2008, when began meagre years, many firms that abolish collective street parties for budgetary reasons.
To not abandoned traditions, many employees is footing on večírcích of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the ability to bear, as President of the restaurants gremi de restauració de Barcelona, gaieta farras.
Representative patronátu restaurant facilities at the moment does not dare to predict what will be the celebration of this month.
'people have a good mind than do book'.
'they want to, but when it comes to the issue of prices, are careful' provides.
Shops will go well those 'who offer quality and good service at a favourable price', says and recalls that the crisis are customers tend to be a degree of mines and most zákazníku now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey in the various plants shows that the greatest brunt of applications for booking is in the evening on 17 December.
The Group endorses soteras real boom booking on Friday, with most of the requirements is to spend the 30 euro, which adapt the menu, whose overall prices are from 25 to 30 euro.
In the other major companies, which is andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (hostal de la Rita, market, La fonda and others), has brought peculiarity of the calendar more early reservations and this from the beginning of November.
'We have made possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, which should choose anyone moving from 19,95 to 30 euro' report.
In the Group of an grup, which includes El mussol attic, ququ, and a total of 23 enterprises remain optimistic, having seen since the second half of the increase in profits and have a relatively solid prospect of the Christmas sales.
The sources of this company highlights that on 18 December will vytíženým day, because the pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
To my six gang menu added menu Christmas, with a budget of EUR 30 or more, as seen in comparison with the previous year the tendency of visitors to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (the Spanish šumivé wine - massive fly-tipping.
We have also seen that there are companies which, once again, zvou their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
VicePresident society fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the association of bars, restaurants and leisure centres in Barcelona) enric Goma believes that begins to see the end of the tunnel, and argues that the number of tigers' revived ', although clients' bargain on the maximum '.
This impression, even during the Christmas celebrations neustoupil, however, who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has produced a great unrest in the USA
Islamabad produces atomic weapons' at a faster pace than any other country '.
WikiLeaks documents confirm the links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the Ministry of the US state, published portal WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unrest in Washington inspires Pakistan's nuclear program.
Alongside objasňujících and significant details, which offer on the content of the communication and the ideas of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, reveal these documents, that the cooperation between the two States with regard to nuclear safety, instead, 'is on the wane', and that this unstable Asian country produces' more nuclear weapons than any other state '.
Peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that his weapons are not smontovány, but store, after the components to be znesnadněna their destruction in the case of the attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington.
This lists a ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. pattersonová in one report from the visit by the National Security Adviser James Jones: 'the proximity of some of the nuclear installations to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials'.
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenály and with the cruise missiles is already pozorován only the US, but also Russia, as a spreading and presenting a reason to be wary.
'Pakistan has had on the protection of nuclear installations to recruit staff with strict religious faith; given the decline of the level of education and culture are extremist organisations more opportunities to recruit people who will be working in nuclear programmes or programmes cruise missiles', said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with our counterparts in the US.
The greatest innovation of the documentation published serverem Juliana assangeho is increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on subjects of the spread of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Cable issued ambasádou in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as' frustrating ', saying:' transparency often exists; the offers of assistance remains unchallenged or are rejected '.
In another report notes the Peter lavoy, worker national intelligence services for South Asia that 'despite the economic catastrophe produces Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country in the world'.
Ambassador pettersonová also asks to Washington, during his visit to the Chief of Staff, General ashfaqa kayaniho 'very well established' that 'the Pakistani army must put an end to a quiet support for terrorist groups'.
The quest for WikiLeaks
Obama's senior officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, in order to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol spends' red challenge 'in order to trace and identify where Assange could be.
Everything concerning the WikiLeaks and its founder Juliana assangeho are complicated labyrinth, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday, the so-called 'emergency call' red 'lokalizování notice, and tracing' assangeho.
But it is not a classic orders in detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates on 20 November.
And has nothing to do with the last of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse, which Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, reassuring legal representative of the inventor of the WikiLeaks mark Stephens that 'police knows where and how the contact with Mr assangem'.
It was on 20 November, when the College of the international police based in the French Lyon issued this mandate at the request of Sweden, nezveřejnil it, however, until yesterday, when received authorisation from the Swedish authorities.
This situation has 188 countries Interpol, the instructions to identify or location assangeho 'in order to impose a temporary detention and give it'.
Although Interpol cannot impose detention, which relates to the red challenge of many Member States, as the organisation has explained, however, consider the so-called red notice for enabling arrests carried out - it must be assured of the national component of the police - especially in cases where countries are bilateral agreement on the issuing of the detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where they probably had Assange to find.
This step pohoršil assengeho attorneys, who yesterday publikovali writing, where they are saying that devětatřicetiletý WikiLeaks founder shown a willingness to answer questions the Swedish authorities through the videoconference.
Recall also that assenge requested and subsequently received permits to abandon Sweden from prokurátorky its case that comparisons with the legendary lavrentijem pavlovičem berijou, the head of Stalin's security.
'This is a witch-hunt and not legal persecution', to the letter.
While it is looking for the whole world - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son, Assange is increasingly in an unknown location, but nemlčí.
On Monday, provided through Skype from unknown jobs interviewed editor-in-chief of time - in this interview demanded the demise of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
'If it turns out that was responsible for the behest of the diplomats of the US to engage in espionage in the United Nations and the international conventions have infringed so that the United States signed, it should resign, "he said.
His opinion was yesterday rejected tiskovým spokesman of the White House, Robert gibbsem kvalifikoval the demise of a 'ridiculous and absurd'.
'I am not sure why we should be concerned about the opinion individua, which has a website', said on CNN.
Obama himself has appointed senior officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, rusella traverse that prevents the evasion of documents.
The intention of the president, Barack Obama, to stop to add assangemu on the importance of the conflict with the views, which these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, member of Congress, from January to chair the Committee on national security in the House of Commons, asked the Foreign Ministry to explore the possibility to include WikiLeaks between terrorist organisations' to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who would assist them financially or otherwise provide aid '.
Further managing this advisor flanagan, Canadian premier Stephen Harper, there who said that Assange should 'to be killed', which then had to appeal.
'Obama would have to call on him to reward or bezpilotní plane or something'.
Who did was Mike Huckabee, baptistický priest, former guvernátor Arkansas and possible candidate for President.
'whoever will be in government, who is responsible for the release of information, made a betrayal and any other punishment than execution would be too lenient', said at the station Fox
In the ERC puigcercós search for peace 'pomrkáváním' gains caroda
Republican leader will enable the secret vote on its continuance.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and the end schůzovního system.
Joan puigcercós likely to find a formula to combat already několikátou internal upheavals in the ranks of the ERC (left-wing Republican Party of Catalonia, massive fly-tipping, bezvýslednou due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that his gesture on the demise seems backers of the former leader of the Josep lluíse caroda-roviry insufficient, and also knows that the impact of this sector is now already weakened as a man of his leader, and absolutely cannot do such concern, which had with other zaniklými currents.
Therefore, the leader of the left will seek to gain a new criticism through pomrkávání, which will help it to shield in municipal elections.
First of all, puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able secretly to address its remaining in office.
With ballot papers, not the catch-the-eye procedure.
If they wish to give a voice to the chairman of the protagonists caroda, will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, it wants to avoid divisions and to subjugate its people.
In the talks, claimed that it would not consider potvrzeného half of the votes and one, moreover, but add, without all the percentages that would not be a good outcome 'Bulgaria'.
Supporters caroda demand for the more than to give its position - which as a gesture which does not have any weight, because puigcercós controls on sjezdech largest body.
But, given that they do not have a sufficient majority to be able to enforce demise, will try to the executive of the plan from now until May.
Because we expect that they will participate in the drafting of the document on the strategic reorientaci, which can lead to vote on in the National Council of 18 months ago.
Their aim is to promote puigcercóse in exchange for the promises of Congress in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC, stated that 'mnohohlasnost' damages stability, and that its aim is to be able to compete once and for all, the organisation of their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, seems to be symptomatic rule that the current adviser, Josep huguet signed on his blog.
Having taken into account puigcercósův ideologue, the adviser for innovation has taken a fait accompli that leader will be confirmed 'in exchange for a number of objectives'.
And those appointed five, of which excel two.
The first is the 'překomponování' executive to represent at least 90% of Members, which means also to cover the new faces, who are from the sector nakloněného carodovi.
The second objective can be a great novelty.
Huguet proposes to bring an end to the ERC completely schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of operation.
And so is fighting for the reform of the statutes to be held separate congresses through delegates selected the vote.
Doing away with the model schůzovního system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties is the intended purpose puigcercósova team in this regard already fought on the last two sjezdech.
However, the cramped Assembly in 2008, decided that schůzovnictví must be considered at a special Congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still nevyřízená, because the situation within the party is discouraged from resolving this issue.
Now, without číhajících critical sectors, could be a good moment to address this issue and try to it once and for all.

Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on the Statute dream act and other projects, such as the ratification of the new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, the start.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the law dream act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said that he believes that, once solved fiscal issue, it will be possible to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.

Although the House of Representatives is sympathetic to the other version, according to most analysts will face the greatest obstacles to dream act in the Senate.
With literature are placing a finger in the wounds ('poner El dedo en la llaga' translated 'put the fingers into the' is the equivalent of the Czech 'strike the nail on the head - massive fly-tipping.)
The second round of the cycle of the language was promenádou, where the participants demonstrated the literary gala
'This is sex in a language understood, but... a finger to wounds? what awaits me?', questioning the novelist Luisa valenzuelová, which was invited to initiate a second round of language cycle, which celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used in this opportunity as podtitulek (in another exhibition of the table devoted the subject of sex in language, explained).
Fingers into the 'brings us into a' offer líbezně the Argentinean writer to audiences, složenému predominantly of young people, which had gathered on the international knižním exhibition in guadalajaře vyslechlo this debate to table moderovanou marisol schultzovou and involving valenzuelové, Sergio ramíreze, mayry monterové and Luis García montera.
Luisa valenzuelová read the text, which devoted gonzalu celoriovi, and then schultzová called for the excellent povídku, which presents Luisa in the first person as protagonistka which, in the search for knowledge, what is the 'blow' walking from doctors to doctors, from which it does not answer although traces of the same story.
Since infektologa is convinced: 'patience is not my strength, perhaps it will be my blow'.
Eventually, after traumatologem frustration with which it has taken its breath in the middle of the road, but explain that wound is not scientific deadline, it is the psychoanalyst, which reveals that secrecy: 'the morning is this really rozevřené and symbolic is jizva'.
The odlehčeně protagonistka povzdychla and concluded that 'ráně it has managed to learn is that it is this really rozevřeným and that there is no', but feels that the pleasure and the dangers in the language must go hand in hand.
The novelist valenzuelová played with both.
Sergio Ramírez nikaragujec also speak with rozkošným vyprávěním, which he called the avocation of invention, which is not a finger in ráně appointed, but at one moment occur.
With elements of magical realism tells the famous čarodějce, which has played a cloud, brought back to the people, who have gone far or napravovala počestnost, which has lost one heads, this narrative, which will then have appealed to speak America, the great novel in which from the outset nechyběli his own kronikáři, telling, and there is quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, which criticises any exaggeration in narratives of captains.
'Cervantes, which all of us (writer) humans, mocking fingovaným testimony, which was presented as a real story, but in a different way, has never been the story of America with such obrazotvorností, which lacked even shame'.
However, stress, 'It is crazy and liars, who have greater imagination', and this is where merges the fact lie, and where we do not know what the story belongs to the same group and the other, achieves fictional literature its peak.
It is called a 'cervantovskou tradition'.
'thanks to his legacy we have what we have.'
Subsequently Mayra monterová stress and commend the diversity of interpretation, by inviting the international book fair, with its besedou fingers into the possible.
Kubánsko-portorická novelist has shown its finger on a great blow to social violence, which is undergoing its countries - and shares it Latin America - and it is a result of the trade disputes and the sale of drugs.
'I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs are concluding a quiet compromise, which is not, of course, the', she said, having said that, the reality of literature is communications and dimensions of the compromise, which creates between the author and readers - and in their 'chemical response'.

He said that, in a world which lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and controlling consciousness, which dogmatismy, it omits, 'that behind every přitakáním conceals small not and for each negation of it is also a small yes'.
'to be masters of our ideas and reality, we must přibarvovat: přibarvovat means very much to put a finger to the wounds and bother those individuals who are much more convenient, as contemplated in karikaturách, černobíle, fixed ideas and without hue, and bother the authority, which show that this black-and-white world', made to support the sense of writing.
For my first title Romano
Rubén Omar Romano, three defeat in the final, during their careers experienced both good and bad, but it has already achieved on three occasions in the decisive series.
In duelu Santos Laguna and Monterrey won, besides střetnou two different styles with their techniques, teams that are real difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano, three defeat in the final, during their careers experienced both good and bad, but has managed to achieve on three occasions in the decisive series, but until now go away with this impression nepořízenou, and that is precisely why the chance for it.
Argentinec have to make do with a silver medals, remained step for the winners and curiously play with the same team the following final.
Santistický strategy as a trainer got into its first final tournament apertura in 2002, when in the hands of the reins of the club morelia, which has succumbed to overall 4-2 against toluce; then in the tournament clausura 2003 once again to advance into the decisive duelu, and it lost with the overall score 3-1, which was against the team rayados.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament torneo bicentenario 2010, once again against the 'ďáblům' from toluky rubén once again, was defeated, although his team has played against 'uzenářům' (another přezdívka club deportivo toluca massive fly-tipping for 210 minutes of the game nerozhodně 2-2, after a series of punitive shooting into the advantages of three to one and two opportunities zpečetit title, but at the end of his three players flown past our team of 11 and so have suffered a turnaround on 4-3.
Two final rubén already lost against the 'red' from ďáblům toluky and one against the Monterrey, its future rival, therefore, to avoid the same fate and curse, and so for the first time to celebrate the title, although it says that it is the most important institution.
'I want to emerge as a winner, I do not want to worry about statistics, this is a club for the passion that I am obliged to, and title would, of course, for me, but that is the most important', the trainer, when he was asked about the figures, which speaks in the final against it.
In my previous finale, in which, as has been shown, many taught, 'we have taught us a lesson that, as long as the ref nezapíská end, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared to take action, as well as the players, because the last two penaltami, we have already been prepared vyběhnout celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned, until the end, we cannot celebrate'.
It is not a concern that this series of taking a decision in criminal stříleních, believes its players: 'never nesnažíte to be a series of criminal kopů, try to stop in normal times, but sometimes there is no other option, and we need to be prepared, in the last tournament we are prepared to have, unfortunately, but the fate of us přichystal bad economics, perhaps because of nervům or anxiety, which we felt was the title in our hands, but we have lost it, that in the US something left and let us hope that this time of this sort will not happen'.
Romano is in the hands of the chance to stop being the second and a taste for the first time, glory, which brings titles.

Dupont is partly blamoval
Quebecký rozhlasový moderátor Stéphane Dupont is suffered a split failure from the Canadian Council for the standards of radio and television broadcasting (rrtv) due to the controversial statements concerning social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as for gross expression during broadcasting.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting reckons that Mr Dupont is and his group from Choi 98,1 FM should also have the right to express their views, but some of the comments contain a 'inaccurate information on social assistance and the unseemly negative to portray Haitians gross language, which does not correspond to the broadcasting vysílanému during the day'.
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who have taken up life neporušily regulations for radio broadcasts.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting has received a number of complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasting, posted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaints of the common queues of the beneficiaries of social support quebeku.
The Group complained that the sums in the broadcasts were inaccurate.
Hosts must submit reliable information, not deceptive.
As regards the suicide moderátor Stéphane Dupont is thought that suicide is a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that transmitted by the report was that suicide cannot be regarded as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
'The Commission considers that the contentious episodes of broadcasting' dupontových poledních reports' hit on the delicate subject of an impartial and appropriate manner. '
For it was not raised any accusation.
The latest dispute about the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
And jean-rené dufort Stéphane Dupont is therefore in media incidents, which triggered many reactions.
Moderátor Choi said that did not send any gift to help Haitians, because we know for certain that it takes real money gets.
The Commission considers that these comments are not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates the unduly negative image of the Haitians.
'I am odčinil my three-day postponement of the'.
'My underlying dossier is intact for one and a half year', said moderátor.
In all the decisions the Commission refuses to be used in the broadcasting of gross expression.
In any case, the radio broadcasts choi-fm cooperated 'beyond their duties'.
For the station, which will have to, among other things, to announce this decision once in the course of the broadcasting within three days, the consequences are minimal.

450 nasmlouvaných million without public tenders
Hydro-québec passed by mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with firms providing engineering on hydroelektrický eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is precisely the consortium created from firms bpr, Groupe sm axor Dessau, and which has obtained the contract, the contract on the management of the entire project totalling 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, on behalf of the énergie gérance was in 2004 zplnomocněno in parallel with the selection of society hydro-québec to svěřilo to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this significant hydroelektrického project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005 consortium 'énergie gérance' acquired a lucrative contract without any declaration of tendering.
For quebeckou hand, the complaint to a consortium of businesses from presenting us with a serious problem of an ethical nature, which is risking the exclusion of competition and cause price increases.
'It is a new way of implementing koluzi and destroy competition.'
'This means that people are already ulterior agreements do not secretly, it is now doing openly', said yesterday MP PQ Sylvain simard at the press conference.
A little earlier this morning, M. simard posed the question of the Assembly, because it says that badly, how can it be sold to the public interest in this way.
The Minister for natural resources, Nathalie normandeau, afternoon argue vigorously popírajíc that this would be for this contract on koluzi.
'I have their way, "hromovala and claimed that PQ was' dishonest 'and' lacked accuracy '.
She said that 'it would be the least that could be' PQ unwell.
A recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice in the world.
It is usually a alliance, limited in time, which will allow two or a few businesses tie their mutual expertisy, so that they can respond to the invitation to tender offers for a comprehensive project.
The project eastmain is very complex with regard to obsáhlost work.
The construction of already is, and must be rozvržena by 2012.
Nevertheless, the Treaty has been granted, without competition could act; it was trade.
It must also be acknowledged that formulka konsorcií is no longer in quebeku exception, and that even a relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le devoir formulka konsorcií in the area of advice in engineeringu is the subject of investigation in the government.
In the speed of the commercial register přelétneme-li quebeckých firms, this will allow us to identify more than 200 konsorcií, with some appear to be created by their permanent.
This company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of their main competitors; - Cima + snc-lavalin génivar, and Roche and tecsult.
Any combination, and there are tens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As regards the consortium énergie gérance, the Minister normandeauová underline in particular the fact that 'the territory of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamism of the labor force and that hydro-québec has responded to since the 1970's.
The patron of the project eastmain, réal laporte, from the Baie James (sebj) has given explanations, which obliges us svraštit front at the fact that the Treaty on the management of the project was concluded by mutual agreement.
'If jdeš into the public competition and if there are few participants competition podávajících offer your proposed prices may be higher.'
'You have a choice of two options: i.e. that sebereš people who are in the tender as participants in the competition, and that řekneš:' let us conclude an agreement satisfactory and with a good price. '
But the main idea is that important, but it is not the competence of the people, "confirmed the laporte.
This Treaty has granted a consortium énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50 000 $, which has received party quebeku.
Contracts were concluded with the company hydro-québec or sebj eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert on the project.
After verification Le devoir 109 contracts can count on the advice of the industry engineeringu concluded between the year 2002 and March 2010, with firms or their branches, especially laboratořemi, provádějícími analysis of samples of land.
Snc-lavalin shrábl 22 contracts, for this génivar of them received 14 and 16 tecsult Dessau 10 without should share in the 'énergie gérance'.
All contracts were concluded.
Together account for 449 783 344 $, including contract companies énergie gérance to 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain simard indicated that the four companies, which are part of the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor) are 'very good acquaintances Liberal Party quebeku'.
The Minister normandeauová delete the report that PQ is also linked to the firms that it 'Fund', before specify that it is more about its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - the 'green' on the label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
Very few players quebecký consumer trust, sustainable development, as well as the 'fair' marks and environmental certification, for it ran in the choice of products.
The worst thing is that even if koupeme in the media space, which the US urges and urges a socially responsible consumption, the cries of the media space at the inadequacy of credible information, non-compliance with obligations, which qualifies even as a brake on their commitment, stated baromètre responsible consumption, whose first rule out yesterday.
Although, in 2010, increased consumption of so-called socially responsible quebeku products, the people who are trying to sell, they still do
Two thirds of us actually say that they do not believe the promises of firms, relating to the environment, simply because the Green advertising companies, finds measuring instrument, as drawn up by the observatory responsible consumption of universities in sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of all consumers has doubts about the credibility of the official certification, přikládaných on the so-called fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands, which are described as ecologically responsible, says barometre.
In the same way, the politicians and the debate on this subject is taken as serious a mere 14.6% of the population quebeku.
Information on responsible consumption, it seems, however, be the first to stimulate this site of consumption as well as renewed currently nearly a third quebeckých consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious character of information would soften the enthusiasm of the 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake on which identified baromètre, for higher prices for these products.
After all, a third of the population quebekuse puts nedůvěřivě vis-à-vis the reported data on products or 'green' services, which we are looking for is to be left to pass our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of all consumers to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or a few products, thereby respond to their convictions.
As many as 61% of them has purchases for traders from their district and to give priority to the purchase of food, vypěstovaných in their region, says baromètre.
More 'green' and responsible - the index responsible consumption has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - homo consumus québeku, I presented as the King of recycling, which seeks to what the lowest possible impact on the environment that is concerned about the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience obviously remained somewhere outside their car claims baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of the population quebeku stated that using public transport or recommend the use of cars to train at least two persons, in the interests of the protection of nature.
Walking and cycling also supported on 39,1% of the participants in this wide-ranging survey behaviour, who used the cliché.
Loan law on buying up the country excentris
The government quebeku, which we have asked for financial participation in buying up complex country excentris companies Angus et Le parallèle, agrees with spoluúčastí, but only to the loans.
Developperská society 'Angus et Le parallèle', which sought to the gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture on buying up cinematic complex in the tabloid press saint-laurenta and which has shown its mission as milovníka film arts, what has requested.
The government's acceptance of the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under their own conditions.
Rather than anticipated a government is proposing quebeku loan, which would in fact be lower, there was the original expectations that could build the basis for a viable solution for the advantageous conditions and resources derived from the state.
The first action plan and the requirement to 12.8 million has already been rejected Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the plan of action was Minister st-pierre the company for the development of entrepreneurship in culture (sodec), François macerola, which governs kinematografický excentris project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But protinávrh government came into society sodec on Tuesday.
Le parallèle et Angus have time to 31 December to one.
However, it appears that hypothesis gift was made from the state must indeed be rejected.
Let us remember that the owners of the country and kinematografických centres in quebeku with direct investment was set against the state, in order to promote, buying up excentrisu usuzujíc that the Minister of Culture has to finance the project on the real estate, as it has done for other kinosály.
But some of the participants in the debate, on the contrary, dožadovalo fundamental economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, the scope of their country in ten years, the arts, having itself financed by the construction of complex, which could be the reason for the revision of the financial Council of State.
The lack of room for independent films is, and the more strident in montréalu excentris, was to gain a permanent clientele.
The company Angus et Le parallèle with christianem yaccarini in my head, governed by the campaign on the release of funds in the private sector, in the belief that utrží $700 000 for protlačení acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, one of the three film companies, Le parallèle, continues in the distribution of films for excentris.
The aim of the future nabyvatelů is open to all three rooms on 27 February next year and the project beautiful film xaviera beauvois men and bohové.
But the Christian yaccarini not mentioned Le devoir and so ignores, so he has my group thinks about the proposals on reducing that he made.
Zvednutá curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American strands of the known by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States are considered inferiority complex Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans, but the same whiplash reveal a sense of superiority of the latter appointed to Canada.
American diplomats, therefore, that every kanadskému voters lies at the heart of the kanadsko-americké relations when it comes to elect, and believes that the visit by President Obama's conservative government has helped to be adopted its budget in 2009!
Four new reports which were American ambasádou in ottawě and Washington, yesterday an outright boast of the public, are also sensitive details that are mutually got 'under the skin'.
Communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign says in detail at what point the United States are not part of the betting, which discussed the political leaders.
There is a great surprise us ambassador in ottawě, David wilkinse.
Mr Wilkins provides for this situation a few explanations.
'The Canadian inferiority complex, almost utkvělý, linking perhaps political leaders to talk about internal bets rather than to realise that these elections are also relevant to the United States (as in the campaign for free trade in 1988), "she writes.
'The United States is therefore' closed 'příslovečným slonem in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about them'.
The Ambassador understands this' ohlušujícímu silence 'on less that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
'It is logical that the ability of the candidate, or even better, party leader to manage these important relations should be the key factor which electors have in mind when they go to the polls.'
Other expressions of this importance can read in the report that sent on 22 January 2009, Terry breese charge d'Affaires in ottawě at Ottawa, preparing the President Barack Obama on his first visit ottawy.
'your journey will help to ensure that the government in a confidence vote at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits its first deficit for more than ten years, owing to the recovery plan of EUR 30 billion to $40 billion', writes M. breese.
Nowhere does not mention that the government has had to shelve pre-Christmas session of Parliament to be slaughtered by the coalition and the opposition parties is expressed in terms of its survival on the quality of the recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed Ambassador wilkinsem raises Washington on ever more negative image which the United States cast a dramatic series posted on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts BMW little mosque the prairie, intelligence and H2O, which can be seen not too much subtlety of his references to Maher Arar, 'no-fly-list' or the abduction for the purposes of violent interrogations in the CIA.
Another report referuje that at their first bilateral meetings Hillary Clinton to ask his French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to accept some of the prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner reply yes, but on the basis of the principle of 'case-by-case'.
At the end of the meeting, it says, 'to a paper on Omar Khadr 15-letého muslima, Canadian origin, State Secretary'.
'Secretary has adopted, with the result that component'.
Poznamenejme, finally, that the people concerned WikiLeaks, our palms.
This flanagan, a former advisor to very close to the stephenu harperovi said on waves CBC that the person responsible for this massive brain should be 'destroyed'.
Rozhlásilo doslechl it and discuss it and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The global plan for the reconstruction of lighting
The UN yesterday suggested in Cancun plan for the reconstruction of domestic lighting, lighting shops and industrial area in 100 countries with a view to reducing the greenhouse effect (GES), which amounts to almost one third of further restrictions, which is needed for stabilising the climate of the planet between now and 2020.
This ambitious plan are in the phase of large specific projects, which wants to the UN in Cancun to offset the absence of the difficulty of feasible commitments to reduce on the part of the industrialised countries.
According to yesterday by the plan, if rozžhavené light bulbs, which monopolize even 50 to 70% of the market, replacing žárovkami fluokompaktními or, even better, with elektroluminiscentními žárovkami diodami (del or 'ice' in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) GES emissions on the planet have arisen because of lighting, odbouralo.
Lighting accounts for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the vehicle fleet across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, a large country with a significant proportion of emissions as the United States, China, Europe, and other, among them Canada, involved in voluntary plans for reduction, which should enable the decline in global emissions GES GT from 53 to 49 GT.
But it will be necessary to deduct from this balance even 5 GT to be attained by 2020 the stabilisation of the warming climate change to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude the possibility that we will not get out of control.
In rozžhavených žárovkách 95% of the energy in the rest of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluokompaktními žárovkami the energy consumption reduces 75%, and with the new žárovkami with del, zredukujeme this consumption even twice.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs lasts on average from 6,000 to 10 000 hours.
The new light bulbs with del, such that said this week in the production of Philips - this company has reportedly participated in the study of the UN - have finds the lifespan of 25 000 hours and 80% less energy than rozžhavená light bulb, which gives us an idea of the possible saving with the compensation which aplikoval in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs can also function with reostaty and vyzařovat less heat.
And contains no mercury.
A number of experts expressed reservations about fluokompaktním žárovkám, because they contain mercury and be selective as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in the developing countries, unless producers established sběrny.
However, as the report says, the main source of emissions of mercury on the planet is fluokompaktní light bulb, but rather of thermal coal-fired power stations emitting many mercury needed to produce electricity promrhané in rozžhavených žárovkách.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put into circulation of 25 000 tonnes of mercury each year.
The report also mentions the profits that the detail of this international programme for each country.
In this way, for example, Indonesia would save $1 billion per year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction would be 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire is impatiently awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, has claimed the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the deadlines.
'The Secretary-General emphasises the need for an independent electoral commission has completed its work, and immediately announced the preliminary results, to emphasise the spokesman for the President of the United Nations.'
'calls on all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and should refrain from any initiatives to the announcement of the makeshift results.'
Despite the pressures made some foreign governments allowed the Electoral Commission to pass the ultimate date - Wednesday midnight - without published the results, three days after Sunday's skrutiniu.
About forty minutes before the deadline President CEI in television confirmed that the Commission 'continues to work', to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, throughout the world have invitations to CEI has declared, finally, the name of the winners of the second round, between the outgoing laurentem Gbagbo and a Member of the opposition alassanem Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for 'fraudulent' vote in the north, which is administered by former rebels new army (FN) from the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal affi N 'guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the intimidation of the electorate, which praktikovala FN (a new army) in the north of the country, deter supporters, the President of the Ivory Coast to go to vote.
The elections could be avoided if the Constitutional Council to take account of these complaints, which give Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo that the Supreme Court of the country is neutral, because it is governed by Paul Yao N 'dré, very close to the political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, someone from the north, which dementuje any link with the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as' unacceptable 'and asked gbagba that is respected, but nešel so far that demanded victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that have suffered a loss, and that to lodge a complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the Electoral Commission odvysílat results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, the ongoing on Sunday, was considered a king process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which for years has been split into two half.
The United Nations highlighted at the center of the political faction of the Côte d'Ivoire, that could be made responsible for the violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on 31 October, as a winner with 38% of the votes, compared with 32% for alassana ouattaru to win public support for the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Describe how elysejský palace to explain its strategy of the Americans, and went so far that they gave the Council, how to deal with such cases of the hostages in Iran (a small group výletníků).
Show how the French leaders try to convince Washington that the release of young women have been compensation against the release of freedom majida kakavanda, the Iranians conditions under which in France and hledaného American judiciary for illicit trafficking in material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, comply with sharp světlu the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to akreditovali idea that Syria's President, Bachar Al-Assad, has played a central role in liberating klotildy reissové.
In fact, it has not done anything.
Diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris is the headline: 'Iran: the French comments to the kind of solutions in the case of the hostages'.
Advisers from the Élysée Palace on strategic issues, François richier, aided by the director of the Quai d'Orsay will put them right for the North afrikua Middle East, Patrice paoli, talks with the representative of American diplomacy allegrone.
It explains the French method.
I recommend the Americans to do this as much for that dopraven back to their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
'Do noise', they say, 'keep strongly vyslovujte' in the media, the words' fundamental rights of man ',' innocence ',' immediate freeing. "
It is necessary to bring into the distress of the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
'do all the more, the more you will ask you to stop'.
Because attempts were made on the negotiations through diskrétních channels' silence nothing will be solved ', the Iranians are the' masters to evasive manoeuvres'.
Mr richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is' Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of 'political blackmail'.
Announces that liberation klotildy reissové (which happens on 16 August on the day when it will provide refuge in the French Embassy) 'will require paying the high sums of the Iranians' (kauce 230 000 euros).
And announce that elysejský palace anticipuje cases of hostages, a phenomenon which 'will vyostřovat'.
The Iranians' could, in the future, to detain some 1 800 French people living in Iran '.
On 28 August 2009.
Klotilda reissová abandoned prison for 12 days ago, but it still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: the Iranian man Majid kakavand on which the United States claim that was deported to the illegal trade in electronic material sensitivities in relation to Iran, is in Paris is released on the basis of the decisions of the judges.
The American embassy, as well as many observers dotazuje on this worrying agreement.
In Washington, which persecutes illegal Iranian network to the acquisition of material designed for nuclear programme is the grand majida khakavanda bad news.
France has started on the bargaining?
The liberation of Iranians for the liberation of young women?
In the next interview with Kathleen allegrone, on 4 September, François richier reassuring, that is not the case.
Elysejský palace, as was only 'shocked with this decision, the judges', but a chance to stand up against that.
'held talks between the Presidency and the Minister of Justice' (at that time, Michele Alliot-Marie,), but 'the French Government cannot alter the decisions of the Court' notes.
Mr richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid kakavand is under the 'limited' supervision of the intelligence services.
An adviser to the Élysée Palace vytáčí telephone number zavěšuje telephone handset and then informs us diplomatku that Iranian man is currently in Paris's buildings administered by the Iranian embassy '.
At a time of imprisonment klotildy reissové elysejský palace in Iran are making efforts, through communiqués and organising 'fraud' in the media to persuade that Syria's President Bachar Al-Assad plays a 'significant' and 'influential' role as a 'mediator'.
The Americans observe this activity and are not without irony that manipulation bears fruit, because a number of articles in the press reflects the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes media 'blest' French official officials'.
What is the investment-grade 'gratefulness' vyjadřovaná against M. assadovi, asks the embassy in Paris.
'despite their statements full chvalořečí French official officials privately recognise that only have a vague notion of what Syrians have in fact done'.
The document will then deals with the reasons forcing elysejský palace pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication 'towards the validation of policies of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria' analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 'was a dose-dependent many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and nezasloužená'.
The Syrian role of exaggeration, 'how', 'Paris to demonstrate Syria, what chvalořeči can vysloužit if it plays a constructive role in the region'.
The aim is also to instill grain 'nesváru between Syria and Iran'.
The American Embassy knows that, from the very good resources.
On 11 August, François richier entrusted to him: 'of course we do not know whether the Syrians do something, whether it is anything'
'but, nevertheless, we thank them.'
'this should at least introduce confusion and confusion between the Iranians'.
Klotilda reissová back in France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy has accepted in the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their 'active role in favour of the liberation of our krajanky'.
The end of online gambling after midnight for young Koreans
South Korean Government will adopt the law, entitled 'peciválský', which will prohibit adolescentům play online games after midnight, block access to them, have responsible government officials.
The draft bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask companies with online games to block access to these Games after midnight persons under 16 years, said the leaders of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the family.
These Games' many children plays a night and then with learning difficulties in school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day. '
'We consider that this law is essential in order to ensure their health and their right to a disturbing ," declared for AFP Jo rin, leading factor to the Ministry, who is in charge of the bill.
Online games will accessible from 6 o'clock in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, his accusation.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to reduce daily time access to these games for young people, whose parents request it, added responsible worker.
It also made available to the people who request it, programmes free of charge, to reduce the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by 'and' the daily press brings regularly different facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also undisputed champion in the world championships in online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals in the world cyber games, and that in the face of 58 other peoples.
The World Cup in years 2018-2022: FIFA establishes the host country.
Full of unrest because of the suspicion of corruption establishes FIFA's executive committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and sovereignly 2022, the choice of politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risks that are overtaken by the technical criteria.
The matter is clear, the Royal competition FIFA in the year 2018se will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, španělsko-portugalsko, nizozemí-belgie).
The football in the year 2022 will be much exotičtější, while the International Federation hopes that it will conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its opening night on the African continent in 2010, or continue to pursue the insertion in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of people who are taking part in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince from Qatar, the head of government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
The negotiations in the backrooms faces the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish the hierarchy of the candidates.
According to reports, the English, FIFA documentation španělsko-portugalská (2018) and the US (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation their competitors.
But these arguments will not have too much weight to the 22 members of the executive Commission in an hour for the vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to suspendování two members of the CE mark / European Commission? / for corruption (reynald temarii et Amos Adam) may destroy the chances of his country, the cradle of football, which has hosted world šampionát just once a year.
The BBC in Monday deploying all, when aired a document on 'napíchl špendlík' three influential members of the CE mark (the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou.
How to make FIFA nespokojenou and bring into the distress of the English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
Prime Minister, I hope that he will be able to move that povedl his predecessors as Tony Blair, who in 2005 in London the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
This intense activity will suffice to England to add a new trappings of the name of the CE mark (the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less of a certain, because the twin španělsko-portugalsko includes chips already prepared stadiums, his bill (world šampionát in 1982 in Spain, the Olympic Games in 1992 in Barcelona, euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial perspective of both countries could give these aspirations cold sprchu.
The possible retaliatory measures against angličanům and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only enhance Russia's position, which was an outsider, despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir poutin decided that the championship nepřemístí into curichu and publicly declared 'unfair competition in the preparation of the vote in the word' narážkách hardly pokroucených in the English press charges against members of the CE mark (the European Commission).
'We are throwing them blátem, we are going to try to is zkompromitovat', Mr poutin.
For the year 2022 seem logical favourite in the United States, with its considerable experience of 1994.
The performance of the economy in the world, the seat of the major sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country has great ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, vyhotovily beautiful project.
But these candidatures appear to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 experienced 'test'.
Another threat: the World Cup 2026 China, which has horoucně wishes FIFA, Asia's chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With katarem that out in the form of a ESO basement futuristických stadiums, and Australia, FIFA continue its expansion into new krajin, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pykat for feeble charges TV (because of the shift) paid by European countries, comprising a driving force for FIFA.
The second mandate: zřejmost (certainty)
De Gaulle really váhal.
Mitterrand has given the impression that it is reluctant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate elysejskému palace calling someone else.
The current head of state, it will be a candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost is not in line with the proportion of secrecy associated with the current functions.
It is therefore necessary to do as it keeps the continuation of doubts.
In one, and in the second sense.
In 2006, without attempting to believe this, my friends Jacques Chirac to make claims to the third mandate has been excluded.
On 15 November, with serious expression of Nicolas Sarkozy assured that 'it decides sometimes in the autumn of 2011'.
As the Members of Parliament of the UMP Wednesday evening in the Élysée Palace, the prospect of 'two mandates' zasela little horečný situation.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not since this far.
The President just remind you that a revision of the Constitution in 2008 restricted number of years of functional period to two.
It was from his party only noting no announcement.
This is not the first time that resembles at such meetings humorným the tone of the presidential elections.
'in the worst case, or, in the best case, you are still seven and a half years, the speakers' observed in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: 'do not think that the next stage neuvažuji.'
His předvčerejší statements it will make the candidate more than the previous day; do not make him a candidate or less.
If we give the comments, it is because of a dual truth.
Speeding up the way to the candidacy of Iran to the PA, on the one hand.
But that is not the ring ségolèna royala what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012, it is clear that many in the PA want arrangements to combat assemblies rather premature than intended.
A survey on the other.
Firstly, the voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon before the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% to 44%, according to express bva-l ').
'We have a candidate, and we are not discussing the issue with the UMP' respond immediately and in a prudent way the people of the nearest vicinity of Prime Minister.
'If it believes possible defeat, will not stand, "says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
'still believes that it can win', correcting Alain Juppé, balanced, zřejmostí.
The euro: the European Central Bank to continue in their purchases of titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB in the year should be an opportunity for clarifying conditions to get out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European receivables obliges the Institute for issuing securities will undoubtedly be able to afford to be so insistent under the threat of a deterioration in the situation now tense on the European markets with securities.
The political price would be to higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde pay tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of resolving the crisis claims of European states.
She did not say whether it thinks that the Bank could do more, by, for example, that would increase its programme for the purchase of sovereign bonds.
'I reserve my account for our European partners (...) '.
This evening, in Brussels, in his interrogation by the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed as výřečnější in terms of its intentions, and spokojil that said that the purchase of titles on the secondary market 'is' and that 'we will see how we will decide' during the sitting, which is taking place this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will watch its basic constant interest rate to 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds carried out by the Central European Bank has doubled in the last week, on almost 1,35 billion euros.
And, thanks to the nerozumnosti dohodců made yesterday on the market of new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem, bought for EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Between market dohodci anticipace bar any doubts about the continuation of purchases (see the 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change of direction.
If the operation of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, is that this last bank for unconstrained provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a period of duration from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for a few months.
'I cannot imagine that would change significantly its agenda'.
"If not, it would mean to take the risk of causing a short-term new tensions," says Michael schubert Commerzbank, the economist.
'progressive starting-point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems likely', envisions Norbert bräms, the economist for sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan their interventions in the public debt, 'to the European Central Bank to maintain the volume of buying their bonds to revive its poor market', compounded by Norbert bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks in the markets of the sovereign debt in the euro area does not continue to choose nothing other than to sustain its presence on the market.
'needs at any price to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of well-paid accomplishments States patřícími among the most fragile' testify yesterday a manager of bonds.
Because if interest rates vzlétly, states that more agony to redukovaly their debt, rather than to be stabilised.
It is saving the euro for this prize.
In Italy, the government Berlusconi hrbí heels
After the beginning of the week for Italy disturbing the situation a little release, yesterday with flux obligačních interest to 10 years.
A return to temporary comfort.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the economy, the regions have said that heard Giulio Tremonti, as the situation qualifies as a 'nerozřešitelnou' and that expects' unpredictable 'weekend, which then zúčastněny dementoval.
In any case, on Tuesday the deviation from the lengthy German interest reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of contracts to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared to 263 points in Rome, which has caused some excitement.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi remarked that in Spain deviation of the German interest rates were higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, on its own, has said that it is' too zaneprázdněn 'turbulent development markets' and possible contagion from Ireland.
'The good news is that Italy, the economy of the euro area, there is no such as Greece or Ireland'.
'The bad news is that, like Portugal, "explains stelzer Irwin, the economist in the Hudson River Institute.
Clearly, nešifrovaně, its problem is the lack of growth and lacklustre fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes a risk that it will not be able to cover the necessary funding.
The latest forecasts for the government of Brussels were cold shower.
Italy's growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget that is available to the Senate on his analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission kalkuluje public deficit, will be an even 4.3% of gross domestic product in the next year (3.9% of the anticipated government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new body of supplements to the draft budget that can be implemented after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
'if necessary, will have to be adopted a new strict measures', does the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
'The cornerstones of its economy in order and its calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time', reassuring arrigo sadun, the Italian Member of the Board of the International Monetary Fund, under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
'There is no immediate problem, nor the short-term or the long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of the gross domestic product of 2011 ndlr), is the effort to stabilise the required in Italy is smaller than the efforts required from other countries' notes Pier Carlo padoan, chief economist ocde.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December will be Silvio Berlusconi to confront the motion of censure of the House and, consequently, for it could start to organise elections, which are envisaged at the end of March.
Has the time not appropriate for the adoption of a decision in the case of serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stress this again yesterday in the press conference in Paris: 'I believe that Europeans that demonstrated on Sunday in the course of the day and night, are obviously very sympathetic determined, committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone'.
Although everything is relative, yesterday's noted expansion of interest to the European government bonds, resulted in the hands of the governments and the European Central Bank.
But we cannot even talk about the start of standardisation.
The Office for notaci Standard & Poor's announced that could degradovat record of the debt of Portugal, the objectives of which are most focused various speculation.
'because in May is real insufficiently transparent and clear policy, based in particular on the banking systems' claims economists exane BNP Paribas.
The more that 'political time is running out more slowly than the time the market'.
Aware of all this suspended the context and the danger, which is that the countries themselves are intensifying the debate, to strengthen the existing crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultation between the Finance Ministers are most concerned by the problem and, on a wider scale, with their counterparts in the G20, they are going very well.
With regard to the meetings of the Eurogroup (eurogroupe) and clusters of Ecofin, from the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro area, with a focus on markets (see the).
As regards the European Treasury (fesf), its executive director, Klaus Regling, zapořčal on Tuesday in Singapore in Asia, to inform investors from the Far East, on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this is to increase the funds, it is certainly the ground to achieve this goal.
The first emissions of securities fesf is foreseen for next month.
Yesterday's official representative told the agency of Reuters that the United States will support any increase in mobilized funding additional direct through engagement in fmi.
Countries that it is in the first instance, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
The reforms which join the strict measures quick-impact.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than using Greece and Ireland.
Both countries are to be avoided at all costs that would have requested international assistance before deploying its own budget korektivy and decide on the structural reforms necessary to once again have the permanent trust.
Capital participants in the European funds is finally on the options, disponibilních for accelerating the process of normalization of the markets, the sovereign obligacemi.
During his visit to Paris on 24 November Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether it would not be enough EUR 750 billion mobilized Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to dig on the stockpile of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is a player completely the first trade with Europe's sovereign debt, thinks that an approximately EUR 100 billion would suffice, 'instead of' in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exists: it is a European financial stability mechanism, to this day, funded by EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance to be tried in European capitals.
Particularly when diminished market conditions.

Road traffic on the roads of others classes in Brittany is very difficult to police officers and police recommends vyjíždět their vehicle only when it is really necessary and operation of some of the lorries was for this day.
In pikardii were school services on Thursday banned.

The county office 'calls on all car drivers to the greatest possible prudence on the roads and the adaptation of driving nature of roadway'.

Dgac recommends passengers using air transport services, together with their societies.
In the United Kingdom until Thursday the wounds are closed in the south of London Gatwick airport and airport in edinburgu in Scotland.
Metro grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since it is the discussion on the modernisation of transport on Ile-de-France in full swing, prší billion.
At least in the discussions.
We particularly 23 billion to metro grand Paris, which is to build a society Société du Grand Paris.
To ensure that this development could be launched, announced by the state to provide subsidies to the tune of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is a purely amount, which will then allow companies SGP used for the procurement of funding from its dual source.
Today we finally come to the amendments from.
Rektifikační law on the finances from 2010, which examines the financial Committee of the national assembly of this morning, contains the mechanisms provided for the provision of these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and increase taxes on agents on Ile-de-France.
First, we in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is' for the benefit of the public institutions Société du Grand Paris'.
It is ascertained: 'the proceeds of this interest is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of tariffs for offices which already exists, 'to be modernised, to increase revenue gained from it and that this increase affect society Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it brought?
A pipe dream.
This is not vyčísleno in the text.
We are a long way from the 4 billion.
'It is clarified that these fiscal resources, combined with the EUR 4 billion of capital subsidies that are mobilised by the state and put into society Société du Grand Paris according to the project', we can read in the explanation of reasons.
We in the company SGP this system seems shocking.
'from the time when we have created revenues (both taxes ndlr), we can mask study after three years and then hrábnout to 4 billion, explains here.'
'It will be included in the budget and used as necessary'.
The company SGP considers that 4 billion will be připsány only in 2013 for the budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion are still promised nepřítomným abonentům, causing quite a lot of parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be organised on 7 December.
Mstiví hackers and přičinliví vyzvědači
The case of Wikileaks has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, it has been an obvious scandal, a scandal, which seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy governing relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, testifies to the deep changes at international level, and anticipating the future Shia-dominated regression.
But let us move popořádku.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that the document drawn up by secret service (any nation) consists exclusively from the press cuts.
Americans' extraordinary revelations about the way the sexual Berlusconi is announcing that what has been going on for months everyone can read in the newspapers kterýchkoliv (all in addition to these two Berlusconi) and the notorious karikaturní profile kadáfího was for a long time for kabaretní artists device for skeče.
Rule whereby confidential documents may consist only of the reports already known, is crucial in the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookshop, which devotes ezoterické literature, you will see that every piece of work, repeated (graalu záhadě rennes-le-château templářích zednářích), or exactly what has been written in previous components.
And not only because the author occult texts not pátrá for new information (not even know where to find the report on non-existent), but because those who produce okultismu believes just do what they know, and as it confirms what had previously learned.
This is a mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
The same is true for confidential documents.
Informátor is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit), the head of the secret services (and if it is not, it could be, as I know redaktorem in a newspaper Libération), which considers the true only what he himself admits.
Information with a high confidentiality of Berlusconi, which the US embassy sent a portfolio, have been the same, which Newsweek by a week before.
Why, then, about the discovery of these documents likely so much fuss?
On the one hand, say what everyone kultivovaný one already knows, and that is that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and, since they can heads of state telephone calls or fly out aeroplane in the joint dinner, lost its diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation of the parties transformed in spy centres.
Any observer of monitoring the films on the investigation knows very well that only licoměrnosti it seemingly ignores.
However, the fact that it repeats publicly, have vilified the obligation to hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any an individual hacker can obtain nejpřísněji sensitive information the most powerful country in the world is a harsh blow, not significant, for the prestige of the public sector.
The scandal affects both the victims and the 'executors'.
But let us move on from there to the profound truth about what has happened.
Once, in times of Orwell's, it was possible to deal with all the power, as a big brother, who controlled every movement of their people.
Orvellovo prophecy has been proven since the possibility to check every move by telephone, each carried out by the transaction, navštívený hotel, which the motorway, and so on, became a citizen of the absolute victims of věnce power.
But when demonstrujeme, as what is happening now that even 'of' nejtajnějšími information cannot resist the intervention of some hackera, ceases to be a one-way street and the screening report becomes oběžníkem.
The power of the controls every citizen, every citizen, or at least an individual hacker - elected as mstitel citizen - may know all the secret of power.
How can maintain power, which already has the opportunity to maintain their own secrecy?
It is true that already Georg simmel said, that the real mystery is bezobsažné secrecy (and bezobsažné secrecy will never be detected); it is also true that all the information on the nature of the Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed tajemným bezobsažným secret, because it is vytaženo from public life; but to detect, just as it did WikiLeaks that secrecy Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými secrecy, means odnímat him all the power.
Wikileaks has not done any mistake for Sarkozy or Merkel, but has something of a large Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of the wounds inflicted powers so important?
It is obvious that, in the future, the States will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would amount to its publication on the poster vylepeném on the Horn of Africa street.
But it is also clear that the current technologies, it is unnecessary to hope that can be maintained in the secrecy of the report after the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when the head of state traveling by air and combine them with some of my colleagues.
How can in future be maintained in the secrecy of private and sensitive report?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prediction belongs to the science fiction, and so it is a fantastic, but I imagine government officials who are transported discreetly fulfilling formalities for uncontrolled routes and wear ourselves only those reports that they know by heart, or rather hidden precious information in podpatku shoes.
Information will be retained in unikátních copies in zásuvkách enclosed key: the overall attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, this means alone run backwards.
A century later, when wireless telegraf a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitoval telegraf based on drátech (telephone).
Videokazety (analogové) enabled milovníkům cinemas take a movie step by step, move it forward and backwards and identify all the secrecy montáže, whereas now, CDS (číslicové) allow only skákat following chapters, that is, after makroporcích.
Through rychlovlaků dojedeme from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on air and road transport, which includes the need for three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that politics and communication technology will return to cars behind horses.
The last remark.
Sometimes, the press tried to understand what zosnovalo in secret Embassy.

The climate: how France hackla their promises on financing
One year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to test the observance of promises to quickly odblokovaná funding (řečená financing with the rapid start (fast start) or premature), followed by developed countries.
And the French hacky revealed
In the Copenhagen agreement, the advanced countries committed to provide $30 billion in the years 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France 1,26 billion euros (that is, 420 million per year).
In opening COP16 the EU has pulled the ESO to persuade its partners on the feasibility of its commitment concerning the financing of fast start: the report upřesňující action of its Member States, a press conference grand side event, distribution brožurek...
Transparent operations nedocenitelná and oceněná on their real value: the developed countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries and civil society, the same way and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010, to release EUR 2.2 billion, which brings it on track to adhere to its promise 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are according to the Copenhagen agreement 'new and additional', so as to ensure that it is increased burdens implemented, without being to the detriment of public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the 'new and additional'.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, among other things, France, the process of block.
Today, everyone has been a reference which fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, was deemed a reference year 2009: the international financing, and she has behaved in it even adds 150 million for three years in financing fast start.
Other countries choose to do with the annual payment deadlines or with the dates of the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France has for the financing of 'all new projects' 2010 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no character reference to the spending of the previous period or on the global level of public aid for the development of the D 'aide publique au Développement.
In France, the total amount of aid to developing countries can remain immutable (or even reduce), is to maintain its commitment concerning the financing of the 'new and additional'...
Another key element is the division of gifts and loans.
There is no rule and everyone selects its own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, they think that 1 €půjčené equals 1 €do not look gift.
Obviously, it is difficult to verifiable: the attempt is přirovnatelná.
If the use of loans can be substantiated for some investments, which are cost-effective (often these are projects linked to reducing emissions of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present a single euro, we receive, the equivalent of one euro, which we are giving..., we should not be seen from the title of their commitments, but as the cost of borrowing for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can lodge just such a recital: 'observes' commitment of over EUR 420 million, is doing 91,5% loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36,1 million euros) - see the document of the EU, to think that they can be verified.
It is the only country in the scale of the Union, which uses loan.
Germany has hence killed 46%, while Denmark, Holland or Slovakia (among other things) keep their commitments to 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union will give 1 €on the gratification of its pledge to give France only 10 centimů and considers this desire for comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský corner!
In summary, in their financing 'fast start' France operate with dual šejdířstvím: on the one hand, with the development of stocks in time and on the other hand, with real financial burden.
Although it only 36,1 million euros, will be able to persuade that spends EUR 420 million 'new and additional' in relation to their promises.
Manipulation of the Finance Minister (because it seems that, although it is Bercy who was such a decision) could have a dual negative impact, at the same time, within the EU (why should the Member States to continue the donation, when we need to lend?) and in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely naïve...
The chapter of early financing is little otázečkou, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of discussions on the climate.
But it could be zrnkem sand, moreover, in a huge machine which is UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whether anything, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early financing.
Firstly, France should announce a change in our way of conducting the record for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for their commitment and fairness and justice for the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should prevent the discussion on savings into the long-term funding (other essential chapter currently under discussion): an issue of 'dodatečnosti' or about the way zaúčtování loans.
France should change its position that has become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as is the case for the other.
Therefore, we all hope to contribute to the new Minister for the environment, Mrs kosciusko-morizetové which arrives in cancunu next week.
Surprising announcement on fast start France and its vision 'dodatečnosti' and the use of loans could bring about an increase in the level of international confidence necessary for it to be possible to go further in the discussions.
Bell on pesticides, which children they have digested.
The ten-year child pozře one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of future generations (ex- Movement for Rights and the preservation of future generations.
The Association, which highlights that its results are not signifikantní statistical value with regard to the low number of analysed samples, but they are peculiar to the issue of the 'zpracovávanou bought between July and September, food routinely konzumované in four dishes and one easy meal as a slight svačinu at roughly ten years of a child in supermarkets in L oise and in Paris.
This typical food, involving the official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, the three dairy products and 1.5 per gallon of water on a daily basis - as well as sweets, were analysed research laboratořemi on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting officials.
The balance of dishes is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42, it ranks among the substances are carcinogenic, possible or likely and five substances are clear carcinogenic substances, as well as the 37 substances, which could act as a disruptive for žlázy with the internal vyměšováním (PE), according to studies of the institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
'whilst in almost all cases legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research well, we know that the reality of the exposure of consumers kontaminujícím may be exposed to carcinogenic substances, and / or PE is striking, it says' associations.
Breakfast butter and tea with milk contain themselves around ten résiduí with potentially carcinogenic effects and three identified as certain carcinogens, as is the case with some twenty residues, which could distort the hormonal system.
Jablko, imported from Brazil, the studies as a small svačinka contains traces of six chemicals, including in France banned fungicidní means.
The same applies to the Green fazolky from kenyi, covered by their lunch, for which a study of traces of powerful insecticides banned in the EU.
Moreover, mletého biftek of meat tuna in plechovce and even houska and žvýkačka were punctuated with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water tap analyses have revealed the presence and chloroformu dusičnanů.
A steak of salmon for dinner was' richest 'with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even the analysis plastového dishes used to ohřátí dishes in mikrovlnné oven no analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this' kontaminujících substances' is probably underestimated ', stems from the study.
An ecological evropa-zelení (ee-lv) proposed 'in the face of the urgent situation' to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the 'increase in civilisational diseases'.
In July, the study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, from 76 in cereáliích.
