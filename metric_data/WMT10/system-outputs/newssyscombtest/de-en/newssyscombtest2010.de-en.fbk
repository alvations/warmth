lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owner torment
Scneelose slopes Sorgenn make not only the giant mountains - residents.
The lack of snow scare the people by appointment of ski stay in hotels and pensions.
So you can in giant mountains still free rooms for all winter dates usually mentioned moguls, such as Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited more often.
The people go through the offers, the prices fixed, but it has now fear, binding to cultivate.
And if you ask them to call us immediately, whether we believe this year's Christmas on snow or "on" Matsch, will be led by the operators of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura,.
Who the New Year's Eve - stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, no longer wants to be with the appointment of hesitation.
Anyone saving favored and where the quality of the stay first in second place comes, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer - for the New Year's Eve day mostly just weeks residence.
I believe that they are still for a time, they will try to sell, but then they too must give way, and for shorter periods.
And then the free room quickly wane, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always must always be the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold off.
In our offer is about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have been some cheaper Christmas residence for the last time to prepare, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert,.
The New Year's Eve Day in huge mountains can the Vrchlabi - travel agency also offer yet, but here there are fewer free seats.
Good (also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates were sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter residence also negatively affected by that giant mountains is still no snow lies.
People wait to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to the end of the year to spend without snow in the mountains.
Should the slopes within a week of snow, will also be sold off the Christmas Schiefert, says.
Conversely, and slightly better than in last year, manages the rooms in the hotel horizon Pecpod Snezkou to fill in.
We are around five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve day and at Christmas we only have a couple of free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua in February, and will also run the business better, informed the Director of the best hotels Pec, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the New Year's Eve residence is also the hotel in the central parking Omnia Janske Lazne occupied.
By contrast, in the latest hotel to Christmas in Janske Lazne even half the beds free.
pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we currently have around 60 percent occupied.
A bit is weaker now the February, but in the moment when the snow comes, certain also increases the interest in the residence in the giant mountains, led by the director of the hotel, Erik Sporysch Omnia,.
On a more snow bescherung awaiting the giant mountains - hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it should cool and if it comes to rainfall, should the snow on the mountains.
But then again come to a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather Hradec Kralove in office.
US: repetition is mother of wisdom
It is almost funny, with what pupils strebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of wise, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue repeated that he himself for the stupid.
When he finally his anxiously awaited Afghanistan Doctrine ausschwitzte showed it is that those on the copy paper from the Bush Iraq Szenariovor write off three years ago.
Not only that, several times in the text itself, the phrase "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new way forward", used without hesitation.
And he has even three years ago the Bush idea - fresh contingent of troops by the civil war in the troubled Iraq - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische criticised decision".
That the following months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military outgoing Bush strategy is the only possible and has been very successful so that we in the news on Iraq today no longer speaks.
The call by Bush was not improved by objectively, because he has his successor, left a lot of grateful starting position than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan hopes Barack Obama insists that the miracle repeatedly.
To increase the contingent has once again asked the military, especially the top commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten zaudernden protect the White House harshly criticized.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The President of hesitation in three months, but is in no better idea come and so he has about 10,000 soldiers General wenistens betrayed.
For Europe has the promise for further 5,000 presses, even though he himself was originally expected of at least 10,000.
highly problematic in the entire Obama strategy is are projects that troops from Afghanistan in just 18 months, and to withdraw this process to conclude within three years. The whole Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase halved the same effect as the measure will bring in Iraq.
Even despite the fratricidal wars of recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well-structured, honoured the values of their leaders.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the Kontraindikation - on no one can leave no agreements and will be kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were created formally correct, leaves only licence buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations further out is rampant.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of a lack of transparency of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran - influences even more complicated.
Even the building of an "action", which states the minimalist objective of the whole operation is, is very unrealistic.
time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating further and now they are on the verge of explosion.
believe that small soldiers in the war cry broke out on the "early" return home, here are a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul who are not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession included the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans, to the battlefield in Afghanistan to participate, is running out.
Europe's politicians can and want their voters does not explain in what way the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush mountain vorland - is connected.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops to be solved.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama is the victor's withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will, but also a dramatic twist of the Afghan situation means.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that even three years remain until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time, so that he can take on a different strategy, fallls this will prove to be a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no Prämienboni more in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs this year received no Prämienboni more in cash.
That has the company announced the to the sharp criticism of its pay practices responded.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but first we can sell in five years.
Moreover, the shares the managers in the case be withdrawn if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so pursuant to the agency Reuters at the forefront of efforts that Prämieboni Wall Street to connect with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which it has led to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs itself was the target of criticism after it for the first three quarters of this year, almost 17 billion dollars for Prämienboni had set aside.
The total amount of Prämienboni during this Jahra, after the agency Reuters probably also reported today despite the measure to exceed $20 billion.
The high Prämienboni in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hot political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends, the bonuses of the bankers that exceed the 25,000 pounds, unique with a tax of 50 percent on polluting.
Similar steps is also preparing France.
This year, women who won a Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have today in Stockholm from the hands of desKönigs Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, this year's Nobel Prize for literature in the technical categories and accepted.
In addition to the four women scientists was among the German writer Herta Müller, Romanian Abkunft, including.
The Nobel Prize for medicine has two American Biologinnen, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak Chromosonen for research in the area.
The prize for chemistry has the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awards the Nobel Prize for economics, the the Amerikanerin Elinor eastern Rome and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report received.
The only specialist category in this year, no woman has received a Nobel Prize in physics.
This price have today the scientist Charles Kao for research in the fiber area and George Smith, along with Willard Boyl - for the CCD chip - invention, the day the basis of all Digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical distance cane.
Each prize winner has the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the purchase of the prize money.
The totals in each category of ten million Swedish kroner.
When there are several prize winners in each category, the price of money will be divided among them.
tradition, the US President, Barak Obama, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already received this afternoon in Oslo.
He has in his speech the Kontrovere his appointment recognised, because he is only the beginning of his journey, and beyond, to the tip of the country, to lead the two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of his policies are complementary but that wars in certain situations for the hard-won peace are required, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning receives the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government because he thinks that with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form of this through the parliamentary assembly on Wednesday was released, disagrees.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting will be.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in the public finances further deepened.
Through the conjunction of informed the President spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Beyond is another remains in his post shall Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, to negotiate.
After the Budget - now receives Gesetz,das Klaus to sign if the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor management.
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the Left Party, proposals for monetary upheavals and put the money for the salaries of state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and wage increases directly to the farmers.
The government has the proposals of the Social Democrats told that they increase the budget deficit masks.
Between the Left Party on the one side and the government and right-wing parties, Klaus, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic dispute emerged, dessentwegen the question mark on the further work of fishermen - officials cabinet, whose design pays to the ODS, CSSD and Green party in the Spring agreed.
Critics claim that the budget as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures practically be liquidated by the fishermen - Government of the autumn, and which were imposed after their understanding of the public debt is to end.
Klaus, who signed the law on the state budget may, but not must, said today in the debate breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" represents the public finances have neglected, a longer period of time.
In his view there is no good solution more.
The improvement can only bring a strong government that can still on a broader consensus of political parties could build.
The ODS - president, Mirek Topolanek, led to that horrific is the budget, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
The ODS, deputy chairman, Petr Necas, the CTK said that the concept of official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer called in the drawing-up similar words as "strong words."
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek - words that the budget deficit was horrific that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and which exceed 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD to assess the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Ungeschlagene" of the world, shows much of the country of his fight and victory, despite some criticisms that the role was filled by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and on Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the Southern African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela,stellt in his personal history of the American Oscar - actor, Morgan Freeman,.
Freeman said that he and Mandela was asked by a 90 years, whether he could be in the Eastwood film.
Another important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: 'If I play, I will take you.
The two and seventy years of actors, the price for his role in the Eastwood / drama from the box area "million dollar baby" had already received, the leaders of the movement for the abolition of slavery, the slave owners from the end has become a fictional US president, and also in "Evan Almighty God", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischeStaatsmann was for his active work in ending apartheid in the Southern African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was in 1990 to undfür released four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen" and, at the same time, this is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was issued in the years 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film tell a true story, in which Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of South Africa rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country to some. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmässig and economically divided remains.
He believes that his people can agree through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the world belongs to the outsiders, to some.
Finally, the Southern African team rose to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years in the history of the cinema screen Mandela - to bring.
He had no objective other than to play that role to bring this as close as possible to the reality closer, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said that if he and the world leaders in the same country would be that he would try to meet with Mandela, at night to eat with him before his speech and behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him, Mandela to shake hands.
I have noted, when I say the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred to, and I had the feeling that I know what they are feeling, he said.
For me, it is important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players predominate.
The actor said that six months, had for the role in preparing the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him, as he Pienaar met for the first time in his house.
I remember, when I on the door bell rang, he opened up and the first thing I in my life to François Pienaar said, was: 'In the film, I see much greater from'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actor in comparison with their actual role models, he has headed by director Eastwood, "Invictus": Ungeschlagen received positive Rezensionen and we also talk about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critics of the Journal Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words together: "That was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the film rezension on the web pages rottentomatoes.com Invictus 76 percent, has received positive evaluations.
light secrets on Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile
For Norway was a special light effects of unknown origin to observe.
The Russian Defense Ministry has just yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch was again not successful and as a type of "Bulava missile, which was originally called" the pride of the Russian army should be, is becoming a nightmare of Russian Generalität and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on the ground in the missile tests had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or launched in the air had been damaged.
In the Russian newspapers already be Bulava writes about "than a" missile "which do not fly."
A missile, which flies is plausible, but not
This is already 13 attempt, was the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, are technical damage to the rocket have arisen.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava launch" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which under the water of the White Sea drive.
This missile type enables firing from the submarine.
It is likely that this caused by an unspecified flying object mysteriously light on North path indeed the damaged "Bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The Generalität has diesesmal protest and claims that it is not able to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell not from and the accident was only the third stage affected.
In the previous cases, equal the engines in the first stage damaged.
Although not a test launch without a mistake was made, the leadership of the Defense Department considers only six of 13 for unsuccessful.
The nearly 50% success therefore met the Generalität with optimism and so will continue to claim that "the Bulava will fly again" without problems and even to ten hyper noise - nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes will bear.
The legendary Fetisov has 51 years with an annual contract signed with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov, with 51 years again in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champions and Stanley Cup holders helps his team CSKA Moscow in adversity, and is probably already in Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, his career with 40 years ago, in 1998, has been completed, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has trained on a regular basis and agreed that he will support the team.
We need only a few remaining formalities to be resolved, the agency quoted to the AP by Sergei Nemcinov coach of the Moscow club.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey players only a game will be affected.
I believe that Fetisov, one of these is to raise the morale of other players, players can lead to Nemcinov.
If Fetisov back on the ice after AP comes, the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary strikers Gordie Howe with one and 50 years a whole season for Hartford and played, he was 15 hits and 26 Assist zuguteschreiben.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Larionov, Makarov, Kasatonov and Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.

In the second part of his career he also collected victories in the NHL, where he twice in Detroit - Dress the Stanley Cup lifted over the head.
Since 2001, he is a member of the ice hockey - star rooms.
Hyundai was the unions to be lifted. All overtime
The management of the Nosovice car factory, Hyundai agreed with the unions on the lifting of all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime has ordered the union on Monday announced the strike readiness.
This confirmed the car factory, Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
The board wants but with the unionists still on a Saturday classes this week some.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, was therefore on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime for the reason proposed that two working class would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company staff, the Saturday classes, which will work a bonus of 400 CZK has offered.
The staff also received after the event for the Saturday classes of 28 November.
Vanek, the company has decided, the motivation of the staff for the proposed overtime changes.
Either they can be paid for the overtime pay or they can make replacement holidays on 28 December and then extended the Christmas festivities, led to Vanek.
Moreover, all staff Saturday classes and lunch money paid for the car.
With regard to the overtime the most pressing and most burning issue in terms of requests and complaints of trade unionists, who were last week, the production had stopped, the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, led Vaněk decided on.
The staff of the automobile factory had until last week been forced to virtually every day after the eight hour shifts or 2 overtime work.
From signing the agreement will revoke the strikes willingness on the part of the unions.
WeitereVerhandlungen between the management of the automobile factory and the unionists should come on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they are to meet the demands of some and a joint document can sign that it is willing to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automobile factories, last week, on Wednesday, worse than approximately 400 staff on strike spontaneously due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment and alleged harassment.
The board felt, however, that the staff of the overtime to comply with the car supply needs to make.
The trade unionists demanded in ihremMontags - strike readiness declaration that the employees, on the last Wednesday of the production had resumed, with no sanctions.
In the area of the overtime request the trade unions, the overtime work to reduce to a minimum.
Furthermore, they call this year the payment of 5,000 kronor paid off.
The Nosovice car factory, Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The series was in production in the company launched in November last year.
Until this September have approximately 80,000 vehicles manufactured, the current manufacturing capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also in ´gestählten´ HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German researchers testing new compounds, the spread of HIV virus in the organism should stop.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that he works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevailing against the disadvantage that the link to normal viral variants is not so strong, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
The patients can compile the medication but life extended and the reproduction of the HIV virus in the body to prevent.
Its revenue, but of a whole range of side effects accompanied.
incomplete suppression of viral reproduction has also the development of resistant virus. sg the result against which no medicines more effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences, of the CR VSCHT (chemical, technological university) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way how to deal with the virus, resistance.
They have proven that the substances known as Metalokarborane on the protein substances that act for the reproduction of the HIV Viruses is responsible.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links block - reproduction of the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new ´verbesserten´ links on basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of their attachment to the viruses - protein materials were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor -, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
insidious and enduring virus
HIV Protease is a protein substance of the HIV virus, for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV Protease caused by the HIV virus - split mature infectious virus particles would not arise.
If we eliminate HIV Protease, we follow the reproduction of the virus in the body of patients from, say the scientists in the press report, the Institute for Organic Chemistry and the National Academy of Sciences Biochemie CR was issued.
In the work in the Science paper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then further changed systematically.
Something weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against HIV Protease wurdne in Reagenzglas tested, even against their steady (resistant) variants, of the HIV infected patients have been won.
The impact of the Metalokarborane to normal enzyme - variant is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicines, however, they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, against the use of medicines often are ineffective.
The unique effect mechanisms and their other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical design that makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective drugs against HIV research directed, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and molecular genetics Biochemie and the Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
dispute over budget. ODS went on fishermen are opposed to the lottery
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for next year as "horrific" and the Government of Premier by Jan Fischer should, in his view, consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS, described the Prime Minister as "strong words."
It is alleged time for analysis.
The Deputy ODS - chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to take in Parliament to prop up to the minority when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit is, or whether he is staying in office is using the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas has pointed out.
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the 2010 angenommen,allerdings with left-wing parties - amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for state officials salaries, for maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers increased.
The government has in the proposals of the Social Democrats told that they increase the budget deficit masks.
The Czech Republic, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor management.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, also met because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional arrangements. Frase emergency Clear
frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has on his disappointment and a sense of the futility of spoken, whereas Premier Jan Fischer has argued that the government has to assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation in the case have threatened that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier registered.
However, he has indicated that he is further considering staying in office.
reason to do so is his disappointment about the Verhandugn of budgets.
To what extent are fishermen for further battle with the budget deficit, so did express Necas Nominanten pursuant to the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the Budget had prevailed in the government to do nothing.
The Premier should also be clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue deficit - enhancing laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions concerns or the service novelle Act.
Topolanek: The by ODS nominated ministers are wrong not
This is matter of prime fishermen and the entire government.
The result of the ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek in a text messages from the US stressed.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who sit on top 09 known, voted against the budget.
Necas said that if Fischer darür decides, in the battle against the deficit level of public finances to refrain, "it is entirely logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority in Parliament, which at the moment is."
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of the people can count on Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if the current will be, then I will be busy, said of the citizens of Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back at the request of Prime Minister
Necas said at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats would explicitly ask that you allow the adoption of the budget.
We come to us not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded then on the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament, and in the Czech Republic cannot be rolled back.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
Even when I dropped to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positive, would react, Topolanek itself.
According to the new map of the CD (Czech railways) will be fewer trains for roughly the same ticket prices drive.
The Czech railways closed or restricted from 13 December some less full speed and local trains, other ties will be strengthened against it.
The whole transport volume will be valid from the day of the new roadmap compared with today at two percent reduced.
Most fares usually mentioned moguls, such as base and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several compounds possibilities in the capital, for example, received the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, the railways, for this line trains of the Pendolino type.
The fast trains will not longer after Bratislava (Pressburg) drive.
Less fast trains will also be on the line Prague - Pisek - Budweis drive, in principle, be the direct link from Prague to Letohrad reduced.
The biggest reduction plans in Hradec Kralove rail district (Königsgraz), a total of about eight per cent, on a rise can look forward to Prague and surroundings.
also be lifted two night trains on the line Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on certain days of the week will be the operation of some fast trains on the route - Prague Pisek - Budweis reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct routes from Milovice after Prague, currently, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem switch.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks from Lysa nad Labem rail electrification after Milovice is possible.
The long-distance also in the capital will be the main railway station in the target station Prague - ends.
The CD leads more links line SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk/Jesenik in intervals of two hours drive.
With the Pendolino can the passengers since 13 December no longer travel to Bratislava.
In this year's bill for regional rail: rise by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Department of Transport, as a whole, receives the railways to the settling of the so-called liquidity losses in the next year, four billion Kronen,genaus as this year. The local train supply the districts, generally pay for them in next year's eight billion kronor, while the state three billion zuschiesst.
This year, the regional train 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local train and the fast trains, the railways a ten-year contract new completed, until now the treaty was only ever completed for a year.
The railways praises the system, perhaps it also has therefore not to price increases in the great majority of the ticket working.
Among changes, it is only in one-day Netzfahrscheinen CD and in favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska Net.
For passengers without the customer card will be the price of 450 kroner Net CD at 600 SEK increased.
The price eLiska will then be driven by the Stecke depends, until now, it was for the journey between any of the district town of uniform and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine Millitante adopted more than 50 persons to note that the children have been released.
Millitante kidnapped today in the south of the Philippines, 75 people, including some primary school and their teacher.
This has led the agency AFP, the original only about 65 kidnapped informed.
All of the 17 detained children have been released after eight hours, including a teacher.
On the abduction occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 Millitante allegedly used the hostages as a living shield on the run from the police.
The local negotiators are trying now to the publication of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency heard Millitanten to New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against changing the usual Pneumokokken from January.
It will be the first for the families of free and voluntary.
But now, voices reported that the duty - vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminated.
The medicinal Institute already puts the maximum price of vaccines, noted the need to pay for the insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccine
vaccines free of charge for August - children
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken children free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition of St that they have not received a vaccine dose.
Anyone with the vaccine already in last year or earlier has begun, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first vaccine dose should be between 3 and 5 live months of the child will be given.
Already last year left a quarter of families their children vaccinated against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 kronor and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of young children four doses are needed.
In general, experts estimated that the health insurance for the vaccine doses of 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year to spend.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent approximately 500,000 per year.
The duty - was vaccinated with the so-called Janota package introduced.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung caused, but also serious infections including brain, skin infections and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen died in hospital after investigation per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty - vaccination of children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination future duty could be.
From January, this by insurance paid and voluntary.
That the duty - vaccination would be better, said, for example, the head of the citizens association, Kalovsky Nahlas Rudolf.
His association already canvassing long-term for Pneumokokken - vaccination.
The experts at the international meeting of our Association was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we succeeded, at least the enforced.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, led to Kalovsky.
The Health Ministry wants but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken cannot change.
At this moment, we consider this is not at all, said spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the professional society of practical paediatrician, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children are vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of repeat vaccination figures reflect "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this is a voluntary vaccination has been launched," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 per cent of parents their infants against Pneumokokken next year to be vaccinated.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is also is ground-breaking that this was the first land vaccination of the health insurance paid for and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money on prevention, so save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova erkärt.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical child doctors, linked to the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project should the vaccines have been purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some members fear, however, that the insurance so "the money from the Krankenversicherungherausführen could."
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait for the insurance to pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners per month of 40,000 kroner, which must invest a significant amount of money.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
Still you and we
Can Islam French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time in which Swiss voters for a construction ban for Minarette have voted and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academics, a thorough and thoughtful report written about it, whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated – and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book out of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French no headscarf love" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) read, an elegant and dense argumentierenden study of a dispute, which the country shares and employed about one and a half decades and whose effects are still to play.
Bowens new book offers a comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist would not only know what the politicians and the media about Islam in France said, but what is really happening on the field.
He has months in mosques, schools and institutes crime, now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen called "Islamic space" offer.
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students, on the issues, they again the most worried.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall married (or both)?
Should young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals to be lectured to?
Can a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, an interest rate oriented banking system, to use in order to get a mortgage?
It is this seemingly profanen Affairs, he claims to represent the daily life, unlike the political dramas, employed by the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, one in Switzerland, born Arab / Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation tried to open the debate about how it is possible that a a good Muslim and a good citizen, in a modern, secular society.
They have not all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, Bowen, interviewed are with their Salafi counterparts – usually divided advocates of puristischen Sunni Islam, with Saudi Arabia – nowadays is connected to a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims shows.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be reconciled.
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides.
He is questioning whether French political leaders (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state watches) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a harsh treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn told your historic compromise with the secular Republicanism had to make.
He sees more of a "tightening the screws of values" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet."

contractor the US government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor to the US government, the cell phones and - Notebook computers sold in the country, were arrested, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, which until now has not been identified, works for Development of alternative Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US agency for international development and for the World Bank.
consular officials in the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost anything, under the charge of "endangering" can be arrested.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include an easy protests and critical writings, carries a risk of arrest.
anti-government graffiti and statements will be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing bloggers - Community, the popular Reporterin Yoani Sánchez is cited, the often describes how she and her husband were attacked and persecuted by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country, receive about prices, but that has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably be the tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, the increase a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy attaches importance to the fact that the United States will produce a return if the Cuban government concrete steps in that direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Cell phones and notebook in Cuba are legal, although their new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government allowed ordinary citizens only since this year's purchase of a mobile phone, they will skin sächlich for the sending of text messages, used as a 15 - minütiges phone call would cost a daily wage.
The Internet use is on the island of extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect, often need the government to speak their names.
Too many websites is access restricted.
In Cuba, the detention of Americans is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison, sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, press spokesman for the US representation in Havana.
Berbena said, it could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other free society is legal - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group, "Human Rights Watch", which recently a harsh report on freedom in Cuba with the title "new Castro, same Cuba published," an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country of the sick older brother Fidel replaced.
Vivanco said that the defendants often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often have a negative reaction in the United States provoked, just at the time, as the two countries move closer together for greater willingness to engage in dialogue.
Pakistani government officials meet plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered an alleged mastermind of a conspiracy designed, five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to send US soldiers to kill, and have said that they hope this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist Anwerber, the Internet after absuchen radicalized young men.
investigators said that an opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan after they had identified, because one of them on the Internet video side of YouTube favourable comments on terrorist attacks had made.
Saifullah, after their arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and try to help them to the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, to reach the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said Saturday, Saifullah, the al-Qaeda leaders are not convinced that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to penetration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, held far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government officials, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to try to obtain the right recommendations to make access to the Al Qaeda camps to receive when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and have been questioned by the FBI, underscores the crucial role of Anwerber to identify future terrorists and possibly even more important, in the decision of who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence on a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset accommodate within Al Qaeda.
The Anwerber the organisation as Pförtner act, those not let in, whose commitment to the holy war not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would-be recruits are from A Qaeda of a special examination, said analysts.
Because of its potential access to US objectives and its propaganda value it but also as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years has also become much more cautious in regard to whom to allow access, because the US intelligence experts are their recruitment methods.
If you try to sneak someone in these groups, what better way could we go, as the recruitment model to follow, which so many have followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is based is now much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in bella - conference centre of the city of bold action on climate protection.
demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimated that more of roughly 25,000 pose.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small shells in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the inner city burst forth.
On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, walking thousands of activists with banners through the city, where English was' There is no Planet B "and one in Spanish, the declared" The Earth says, "Enough."
Some stars joined the protest in, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native country of their mother, they make people aware that with what heart zerreissend problems due to the country's already perceptible impact of climate change has to contend.
That is one of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - to speak and to pass the world leader to appeal, a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way to fool more of a question.
The police kept the demonstrators from too close to getting the bella - centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they either were or pocket knife carrying masked.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators burned in black clothes several shells in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main channels, in whose vicinity several ministries are located.
They threw them in the vicinity of the building, he said and added that its missiles as lights began, but then from "a few large explosions" were followed.
Internally, the conference centre assembled the people on television screens to the entire afternoon to watch the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su, China's chief climate negotiator, as apparently not achieved.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration of a constructive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something to which I was not even aware of."
He then drove in Mandarin forth and said: "Because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He stated that, from the perspective of the individual depend on whether the demonstration would help or harm.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that their negotiations or the freedom of other people upset."
test data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news on the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District Washington still far behind schools in the country is to produce excellence, the certificates show that the fourth and Achtklässler in the past two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made include.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Education Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white pupils, both at the local and national level.
The average point number of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years by 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) of their African-American Gleichaltrigen rose but just three points from 209 at 212.
The performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 in reality by 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell for a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average item numbers of white pupils was not included in the test data, since the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, fraud 60 economies of points (262 to 202).
And although the item number, the children of both groups have achieved in that time has grown, the difference with 58 points now barely decreased.
Some education advocates of the District last week expressed its concern that the results of school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were celebrated, mostly by white students, the children are already strong, have been promoted.
This suggests that the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale increased, which have problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that for the educational opportunities in Washington D. C. entry.
I do not jump for a span of two or three points on and Lower, said the democratic Washington City Council Member, Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton's primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the study point number is that the middle school in the town need urgent attention.
Of course, you would always see the positive signs, which I respect.
What frightened me, however, is that we are not near the time and energy to dedicate the school we must use for our resources.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of pupils to weak performance.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum, the Wilson / reading system, to use that to pupils in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, what skills of reading aimed not at the beginning of their school career and have mastered the significant behind their gleichaltrigen class comrades behind.
everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth class Games and life experience to the fore, was among the former senior school inspectors Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum will some of the NAEP - progress reported last week, which were attributed to that.
I believe that we must continue to work, the best measures the pupils to benefit under the central levels, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP - results highlight the issue of whether to proceed with that Rhee, to improve the performance of the system while still the additional money and resources for the services of weak schools can provide, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit examined.
The conventional remedy is, its resources and management reforms at the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington D.C. are located.
The objective could cause political fallout, the work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as in other urban school inspectors that they tried, the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, the school inspectors now in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the achievement gap is the traditional public school year in Washington, which now totals 180 days, in order to extend the charter schools to compete.
It must be the school year to nearly 200 days in order to increase the force for change, said Janey, with his teacher unions last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which came as "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase seen in the next treaty.
higher education for more people than prospects
The coach met the Gettysburg - College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising from and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facade and the emerald green lawn.
Gracielas parents have hardly Highschool in El Salvador concluded.
Until recently had also Graciela in Silver Spring has been recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never a foot on a college campus set.
Your attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, the cost was a ehrfurchtsvollen visitors, rather than an enthusiastic prospective students.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, would be the leader, announced that they had entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully, as their low teacher to student ratio - - - the school was reported.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th, the children at their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message included in full: The question is not whether auf's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States, Hispanic immigrants, what's not finished highschool or as teenagers become pregnant, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who received the Collegeausbildung, is needed to move into the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of the college ’ Hispanoamerikaner – which is a remarkable achievement, given that many of its immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the United States, came without the Highschool to have concluded.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, a huge role in the labor force in the country to play, to show the way forward.
Those powerful children investigated, said that these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent momentum to success.
Many of them also had parents that their children high goals and find ways to make their lack of familiarity with American schools to make up.
But counselling programme also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to arrive at college, especially if these efforts on a longer time persists.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills, in the way they search through the system to help, then will a single measure to any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, examined the hispanoamerikanische students.
We must consider, for these children a supportive network of the pre-school up through the Highschool available.
The Federal Programme, which had financed Gracielas college tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR hochschalten up - a motion, and is more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems available to college preparation programme to be launched to begin when low-income students in middle school, and continued until they have completed the Highschool.
According to the US Department of Education has the programme since 1999 has helped more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can lead to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 with foreign oil companies contracts of the Iraqi oil ministry suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to have an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry to play that for decades by war and economic sanctions, is paralyzed.
American companies can only shares in two of the 10 fields auctioned for credit.
Seven American companies have to participate in the second auction paid, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a priority, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have contracts for fields auctioned concluded in June.
The few and far between representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has at last after 6 years of war and opened its doors instead of US companies, Asian and European way before, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
It will be a long time no further bids in Iraq.
security concerns, or by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday were stressed and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably stopped as, say analysts, be more involved in Iraq, the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world has.
US firms were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, the contracts with the Ministry can be concluded.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry and maintain close relations in recent years with technical advice on the side, are left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, has offered for more contracts than any other companies with large packages and was able to contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad that China on the road, one of the largest in the global economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its measured with bidders and cannot meet its commitments to Iraq.
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave precepts, what then with the fee per barrel of oil were compared, the ministry was willing to pay the emission of each field on the current levels to increase further.
top planners of the Al-Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attacks along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, this week, a top operations planner for Al Qaeda is reported to have been killed, representatives of the US fight against terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if confirmed, it would be the second fatal attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist group in this autumn.

The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victim, but two representatives of the US fight against terrorism have led an unspecified evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was as the leading military planners of the Al Qaeda, described the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan / Pakistan began.
He was of conspiracies in the world involved, said a senior official, who wanted to remain anonymous, and to the delicate nature of the US air strikes on Pakistani soil referred.
If one adopts its central role as a given, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda in and suspended them in operations planning for possible terrorist attacks at.
The second American authorities representatives said that Somali quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy rise and better links with other extremists groups used in the region.
He may be some Americans are not known, said the second authority representatives, but this does not reduce the risk for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be the second leading Al Qaeda Somali - or Talibanführer, since September, and was killed in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal areas and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by drone is the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a non-profit organisation maintains a website, by an average of six operations per month to two decreased.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability, whilst in the suspected informers brutal killing, reported the side.
leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he resigned from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the United Nations supported Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Eide Weggang takes place, as the Obama Administration has decided that a further 30,000 US troops to send to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, other NATO governments could lead to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and will send the right signal to the Afghans that they are sending the international community can trust, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
This commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, the number of international civilian aid workers, the increase in the political transition of Afghanistan should help.
The troop increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side is, he said.
Eide said that he would not resign, but only in March 2008 to meet his family agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification to UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pass now so that he had time for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to try to find a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the Weggang of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, according to UN representatives with the search for a replacement has begun.
The UN representative said that the Swedish - Italian - stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, recently of the UN mission in Baghdad and has led the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the previous UN peace operations led, has taken into consideration.
Eide position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country to prefer and evidence of massive electoral fraud to conceal.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations by Galbraith - who was fired, "the mission has undoubtedly harmed because already a great degree of scepticism regarding the international interference in the election was."
Eide said that the appointment of a senior civilian representative has recommended to the aid of America's armed forces in Afghanistan to coordinate.
He drive also insisted that the UN leadership of his successor, allowed more staff from the United States and other Western countries and the halt to the Afghan mission donations, and said that this would reinforce their confidence that their money will be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan said and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to introduce capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that my since May, he said, only one person was able to stop.
This is disastrous and should not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" imposed on Iran because it is not in talks over its nuclear plans has participated.
Gates spoke during a 7 - tägigen trip to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of some 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran downwards.
In Iran there are no good options on the election, he said in response to the question of soldiers on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that I am on the soul is, is that if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own UN predictability."
The Obama Administration is considering a sanctions package on the military and political elite of Iran seeks, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" is needed, "the Iranian government, in order to convince them with weapons that in reality is less protected" because of their people, "immense" suffering under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government in the European leaders with the warning that Iran with "credible" consequences if he must reckon with its nuclear program is not the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency to comply.
Iran claims remain that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes should be won.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that the talks to restrict its nuclear program would resume and on a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor would dispense.
The US government has pushed to this type of agreement, in order to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran, but since that time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided as to whether they should be obliged to the United States.
That the Iran the international community with regard to some proposals, which they have already agreed in early October, has simply left standing, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way, brought together as they related to important additional sanctions on Iran never were, said Gates.
President Obama has 31 Dez. set as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before his other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "suffocating" sanctions will continue.
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representative at the United Nations, condemned what it on Thursday "groundless and unfundierte allegations" of some Security Council members about the Iranian nuclear activities, called and said that they are ready, the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "to continue in order to reach a suitable long-term solution."
Gates, who last Friday after Washington should return, met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki, before he entered the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives flew in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular in regard to borders, property rights and for the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to the conflict in order to reduce delays, the US plans to prevent, American troops by the end of August of 115.000 to decrease to 50,000.
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concern over the upcoming troop withdrawal to allay. US Representative quoted Gates, to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will be your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not abandon you. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters on them lectures that "mother earth is too tired to talk to other children" and "A baby more means one more tomb".
These lessons have you learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, the suddenly began to change course and to encourage young couples to have more than one child, her response was immediate and definitive: "In no case."
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is no longer desired, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notorious dicklichen, Einzelkindern moved, the affectionate "little emperors" are known, has produced a population crisis in the country, attracting hazard.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, is taken to the UN
Department for population issues fixed, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in the year 2020 16,7% of the population by the year 2050 31,1% rise exponentially. This is far above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with better educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 years of age and older nearly 22 percent of reported residents of Shanghai, identified during the birth rate of one child per couple was located.
Xie Lingli, the head of Shanghai Stadtbevölkerungs and Familienplanungskomission said that couples should receive the production age babies, in order to help ", the proportion of the ageing population and to reduce the future to alleviate the shortages."
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich -- such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden, is," she said.
A gradual easing
In the constitution of the country in 1978, is enshrined in China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial disposal by the ruling Communist Party until today was introduced.
couples who are against this policy, must count with huge fines -- up to her triple annual salaries in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed to this policy, that the critical demands on natural land resources can be avoided, whereas representatives of human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy has been condemned.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who already had a child, forced to aborted.
Many couples also have sex selective abortions carried out that making an unnatural high ratio of men to women was born.
In recent years, officials for population gradually their attitude to the one-child policy weakened.
In 2004, they have more exceptions to the rule of authorised -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- 2007 and was hard to mitigate the tone of many slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research of the University of Beijing said that government officials recently even on more radical changes have been discussed, for example, to allow two children, couples in which one partner is Einzelkind.
Shanghai, July was the first Chinese city that an aggressive campaign to encourage more births has launched.
posters, the families lecture, only to have a child, have been replaced by directives almost overnight, the detailed description for a second child who comes into question and how to apply for the authorisation.
The city government, municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, for couples to visit sent home and information sheets durchzuschieben under the doors.
They would also ask, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not particularly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the external sector of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognize is that after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported against any change.
In the municipality with a population of 115.000 Huinan than example still per month only four to five applications.
disappointed Shanghai officials say that for 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still on some 165.000 will lie -- something higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want their first is the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, have said that they would like to have two children and this is legally permitted.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance, the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners are assessing the one-child policy as a human rights issue, wrongly, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh month is pregnant with her first child.
Yes, they robbed us the possibility to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples are psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the head of personnel, said that they would only a child because she was also a Einzelkind. "We were the focus of the family and used that each of us has to look after themselves.
We are not accustomed to us to care about others and want this also not really. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 year-old, heard a translation company, said bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through the birth rate is falling, he said, it is important to succeed and to do that you have to be selfish.
The age of the now 20 and 39 year-old grew so as to their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiments are fighting to see and they want a life not for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must their social lives drop for at least two years.
Then there is the area in question -- "You have to modify his home" -- and the lives of programming -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must have a CV for the best nurseries pat."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first that has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
UN group design plan to reduce emissions
The funded by the UN climate conference -- which until now by Wilde posturing and mutual accusations -- has marked on Friday with the publication of a document, another priority for the next 40 years, an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, while recording the industrialised nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement regulating greenhouse gases could provide, has both the remaining obstacles, as have also shown the way forward.
But it was as important progress in a negotiation, which is considered the time next week, as more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text of a specially created for UN working group was formulated, he is silent on the money supply, the rich countries to poor countries, so that should give these short- and long-term global warming can meet.
He also offers a range of options for the key questions, including how industry and big emerging economies could restrict its carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global rise in temperature should be, the policymakers would support.
The process is being given a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, sechsseitige drew up the document, has a 180 pages long negotiating text, combined with the focus on what the leading representatives of the UN climate change, Yvo, Mr de Boer as "the big picture" has described.
It shows the basic cracks of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations shared their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, while larger developing countries would cut their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent would be reduced.
Together, the countries of the emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent to reduce.
The European Community, the talks on Friday also lent a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion US dollars per year available, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
The Friday, yet the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the past week had intended.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has formulations, rejected the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if these are not financed by developed nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration in a tougher line with China continues, as representatives of the Bush administration, not even two years ago.
The United States will sign no agreement without major emerging economies to stand up and take action, so Stern, who also complain that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts also could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion, one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, stating that the leading US climate negotiator either the lack of common sense "in" or "highly irresponsible" of him that he was at the beginning of the week, said that the United States China not financial would help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both in the industrialized nations, but also between the industrialized nations and emerging economies open up fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of its relevant obligations befehden, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are struggling to whom the costs for the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions should bear, because even affected countries are moved, aggressive approach, the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges for their acts to justice.
This is clearly a game, which will develop a new economic domination, so Ulate, also as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America is operating.
Some of the countries, the effects of climate change are most exposed to, said that they will continue to make a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, although the leading participants say that talks in the best case will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday mornings a 24 page draft treaty presented.
Runge Metzger, Artur - the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that is leading the offensive of the small island states' political pressure on the entire political process, "exercises in part because now they are united and measures of the emerging markets, such as China and India, are demanding.
The talks were given new urgency when the delegates will concentrate on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved to reach agreement.
Senior representatives, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and rasten through the corridors of bella - Center for meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to chart the Claims, during the next week will be negotiated.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13 people, daily in a conference centre and gitarrespielende activists from holding late-night shows, where they are fun on the countries which they feel betrayed and sold, and will be draft agreements to hand by hand instead of by e-mail passed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity builds is first to: Almost all key ministers are now here and as of Wednesday, 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the top league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for global policy, the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 kph faster train defined the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe through the darkness, to announce the departure of a train, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter trains in the country will be in his lightning trip of Ashfort, Kent to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km achieved in 38 minutes to go.
At Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin - commuter service go from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain ultimately to an international network ankoppeln faster, more reliable trains and the large areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London will bind.
The neglected province to vibrant commuter town could be radically reduced anfahrt would work time and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, believe the three main parties to this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds, for the construction of a new national rail network are required, the inevitable planning battles and concerns about environmental damage to the British high speed track could still draw the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times, the report on 30 December awarded.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line, the London with the West Midlands, will be linked with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places vorbeiführen, where the effects on the environment are controversial.
In the free site will be the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres by showing the final route.
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, nordwärts leading high-speed rail network is drawn up.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y - förmige route, in which a single high-speed link would lead in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and would share a Abzweig west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and lead others in a northeastern direction after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems the most viable option," said a railways insider.
After the completion would travel time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes decreased.
The first sections, not before 2025 would be opened, it would enable the route of the travellers, London, Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with today, a little over an hour to go.
The proposal offers the possibility of the trains, with a speed of 400 km / h to drive, which means that the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1 000 people can travel to.
Up to 18 trains per hour could by the wayside London - Birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that a final stations in London will be necessary on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be groundhandling.
Given the geographical restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will know whether this plan, in his view, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even though the wheels in motion, the rail network is to be built in sections.
The trains must first to existing rail routes from the high-speed lines in the north of Birmingham, thereby changing the travel time between London and Scotland will remain at about three hours would lie.
This is regarded as a key sticking point, with a change of plane to railways can be ensured, an indicative amount for the railway revolution.
taxpayers come for mortgages for 75,000 pounds - Orangerie of conservatives to
Alan Duncan, the senior Conservative Unterhausmitglied, has the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a bill, called the Orangerie in his homes in his constituency is building read.
The prison spokesman of the party, David Cameron because he was degraded, complain that Unterhausmitglieder "of meagre rations", has its mortgage must live about 75,000 pounds increased to specialist plants growing in a wooden - are second homes to be built in Rutland.
He was allowed to the taxpayer to pay the extra rates into account, a total of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons, the applications were approved and they were also of Sir Thomas Legg not challenged, the review of the expenditure of Unterhausmitglieder carried out. Last night said Duncan that the applications are still not clean or more comprehensible "could have been."
Duncan, one of the richest Unterhausmitglieder, possesses a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
In the nearby houses have a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros) reached.
The crude projectiles includes kitchen, residential and eating rooms, but the Fees Office, a spending control points of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has grown a winter garden, which in the plans is described as "Orangerie".
Neighbours have described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges not called for increased money start to take a stand.
The Committee has him last month after an investigation of his expenses from the breach of rules acquitted.
2004, Duncan security for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) of his London house on his constituency home, which he transferred in 1991, a year before his election as Member of Parliament, had bought.
This week published documents show that Duncan until March of last year around 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage rates get reimbursed.
In April its claims to rise more than 1 800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The rate of Duncan RBS - mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the entire increase money to finance the entry of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros) serves.
The normal stage RBS - mortgage rates dropped from 7,94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest published by the House of Commons documents show that Duncan in this May continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month claim.
Duncan lost his job in September as the opposition leader of the House of Commons after a Undercover reporters filmed him - when, after the expenses scandal said that MPs "of meagre rations" would live.
"Essentially it means that if you work for the state that you live by meagre rations and must be treated as S*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a tiny part compared to what he heard.
And I have the whole damned sum can claim, but I do not. "
The Member of Parliament, millionaires from his previous career as an oil wholesalers, was the first time in May because of his spending attacked, as it became clear that thousands of pounds for his garden before he had demanded, with the Fees Office had to clarify that "as excessive demand could be considered."
An activist as a protest in Duncan lawn has a hole in the form of a pound sign ditches, after it became known that he was about three years, 4,000 pounds (4 500 euro) had demanded.
When he last night on the increased mortgage was interviewed, said Duncan: "This was both by the Fees Office, as well as subsequent by Legg to value increases have been approved."

Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "much too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeons travelled to Los Angeles."
I have personally by telephone with the doctor, who assured me that he considers this trip as extremely easy, but very surprised by what I had, since I had been behind me have two gangs targeting operation, he added.
Shortly before he went in RTL announced that the singer apparently after the operation "without Drainage, all without leaving the hospital".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is in very well-known artists environments.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, operated in a clinic in Neuilly / sur / His, in which he practiced at this time.

He is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, has several times because of mishandled operations and not to forget, because of tax fraud, behind train and was convicted.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Chamber, has him as "a man without scruples", he described the "regular" before the chamber board has to take responsibility for and "anything other than recommend."
After a few days of silence was Dr. Stéphane Delajoux on Friday on his lawyer, Me, David Koubbi a statement.
This said that the intervention would be "perfect" and run the post operative investigations is "normal".
The operation called "no bleeding out and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the Tournee of the singer, whose health problems since letzem summer äufen, called into question.
It is quite clear that it is a continuation of Tournee on 8 January (in Amiens) something is scarce, said Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and urges the party Nouveau Centre, not more to use their seals
The party alliance of François Bayrou's Party modems is monitored, has a takeover attempt on Friday to the mark, the once by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing party, formed part of the leader of the Party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and under threat of a judicial persecution, urged the seals on any document more to use.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to adopt this UDF Siegel, since he is of the opinion that François Bayrou are not worthy of this political legacy to defend, after he left the hand does.
The defence minister, whose party partners the UMP is, incidentally, wanted this strategy on Saturday before the National Council to reaffirm the NC.
For the emphasis of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), which received a claim to the ownership of the trademark UDF collects, since he was the first this brand of 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrial" has requested.
However, broke the secretariat of of François Bayrous's friends supervised party alliance UDF the silence and gave clear to understand that they will not be expropriated and set the ministers and the MEPs under threat of judicial persecution, not a deadline this seals more and to use them to transfer the property rights of the brand.
They have in recent days made statements that many of you of your political movement would propose that the UDF Siegelzu +übernehmen+, wrote the parties in an alliance of 19 of the 24 offices of Member letter signed, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Party modems and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They think well, you have the right, in the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material and on the start page of your site to be printed.
As you know, you have no right to the use of that mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the Party in NC, "immediately the mention of the name of UDF sämtlichem material and of (their) website to remove it."
In addition, it requested by Hervé de Charette, "the property rights of the trademark right on their legal entitlement to transfer."
If you refuse, we will raise a complaint against you, in order to make the law and to respect the legitimate rights of the UDF members to defend, warned the undersigned.
In her letter she stresses that "UDF" a fully-fledged political movement since 1978, and recall that Morin and his friends "have the choice to leave this" in 2007, in order to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, for the party to "UMP" based.
The Party Nouveau Centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie Française) to use.
They continue to remind them that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year joined the party modems and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, has passed.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, as regards the secretariat is continuing, "he was at the time, as he has requested, the brand name for three years, is no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulently, by the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to hold it for themselves.
Then you have to remember that this recklessness on the best ways is, to transform itself into a criminal offence, and the strategy of the NC ironisieren: "It seems to us but in politics as in life with dignity, to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come from anonymity to, by one, on behalf of a fraudulently acquiring, at which it has no legal claims."
affair Liliane Bettencourt, François - Marie Banier will be sentenced for exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre, on Friday decided that the artist François Jean-Marie Banier assessed to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt, claimed a weak moment of the 80-year-old has exploited, get a portion of their assets to erschleichen.
The 62 year-old photographer, for his star photos is known, will on 15 and 16 April 2010 because of exploitation of weakness in court must answer to a criminal offence, with a maximum prison sentence of three years and a fine of EUR 375.000 is punished.
This decision means that in fact a process in this affair will be the saga of one of the richest families of France, is worthy of mother and daughter snatches and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in the hand.
Equally, however, ordered the 15. Criminal Chamber, a medical examination of the 87 year-old Liliane Bettencourt, the joint of three doctors is carried out.
The heir and main aktionärin of L'Oréal has refused to undergo such a study, especially among the, during the investigation of the prosecutor in Nanterre's conditions.
The doctors should be appointed on Friday before the 10 March 2010, submit a report, in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times are Liliane Bettencourt, in a state of weakness may have been found.
I think they will be subjected to these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiations.
As the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt, Meyer, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned with the decision of the court is very satisfied.
This is an excellent piece of news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) this old lady has manipulated, it must be protected, he reiterated.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt, a criminal complaint against François Jean-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler initiated, and accused him, the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings to erschleichen.
Liliane Bettencourt she had always been refuted by the photographers, to have been rigged, which it sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt - Meyer initiated proceedings would have to check the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt to three of his Klientin at their notary sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), appointed in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyer distrust.
According to her lawyer added Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I for 15 years, until a - twice a day to Banier wrote.
Françoise, I have never been more since her marriage can speak. "
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the Klägerin had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection to initiate proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is full rights, are not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody has the right to act on their behalf, "reiterated the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt, Meyer has taken place.
Managers revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain....
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of companies discussion partner of the VIS consumers from the marketing revolution: It is for staff to join "values" of some of the best, as it was earlier to the Consumer products of the technicians in the plant to impose shaped.
By the customer at the heart of the company's marketing revolution of the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees affected.
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially on those of F&Eund, even more importantly, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, calls on the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking Sichtweise";sie claims by the staff of a deployment, which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradictory.
We therefore call for an occupational revolution, which would consist of the staff in denMittelpunkt the concerns of the company on an equal footing alongside the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal polls
Will the internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange wage-earners, he has made this revolution in relation to the proposed management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately, do not.
- First, because I can see that the whole structure in light of a new situation after many detour finally arrived, the priority is to tun,...was it always has done.
Even as the authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures is increasing.
Finally, because most managers a more simplified notion of human behaviour.
emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology of mechanistic.
You take through intellectual comfort the old behavioural theory, which recently by the US "Neuroscience and unknowingly be reactivated" far-reaching of research institutes and through the media.
Thus and making it suggests that it is possible that "lever" (sic) to the commitment of employees to engage in, a strengthened aktuellein Le Figaro.fr Ipsos poll published by the managers in a position to a mechanistic control system which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identified and measured
Instead, one for the smooth operation of the modern enterprises necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior advance.
It is, in any idea or practice of management to integrate a fundamental protocol: for wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it appears clearly as a means to ensure a part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects to fruition.
At present only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis this conception of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set, Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it allows them to achieve their life goals offers.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this mobilisation factors can the leaders of their companies' social performance predict and control, "and they anticipate human resource management back to the right post placement.
Thus they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable.
The speech by Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right one
The US has the rights on Friday by Barack Obama on the eve of talks held in Oslo welcomes and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the united states has defended.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, this time applauded the speech of the President, the example of former Vizepräsidentschafts - candidate in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin as follows.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben raised published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, they say.
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush has inherited, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was in Oslo on Thursday, trying to justify the use of force; a way his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to declare, 30,000 additional soldiers to send to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo have "done a very good job".
I found that the speech really very good was cock-a-hoop, the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world," in the words of Obama's recognized.
In some parts of this speech habeich entirely perceived Ginrich as historic, said in the radio programme "The take away" has been questioned.
The current Members, by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012 will be considered, said that he was pleased to see a "president of the left" to have seen, the members of the Nobel Committee to remember that they "are not free and a price for peace could not obtain, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former recorder of George W. Bush and is now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech kept".
In addition to that he is as "cosmopolitan", "is how he always does," he has "as an American president," said as he pointed out that the Europeans "like living in a security bubble, which they do not themselves have created and for whose protection they have not done much," Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos."
On the left of the President shows the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the armed forces on the back.
They wrapped the war under the guise of Justice, is the massacre of the innocents simply justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left remains, however, continue to praise at the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the speech itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as "Monumentalwerk."
The speech in Oslo "offers a running plan to manage the international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthusiastically.
The New York Times is of the view that Obama "the necessary discourse" and his speech was described as "gloomy and exemplary" at the same time.
drivers: Three marathon for an agreement which secures the supply for Christmas
After weeks of negotiating marathon came the unions of street associations and the TLF - the only employers' organisation, which until the end remained - on Friday evening to reach an agreement, the strike warrant and the threat of serious supply shortages puts an end to Christmas.
In the signature sitting on Friday evening "welcomed" the responsible for the transport minister Dominique Bussereau the agreement on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations was launched.
After a second night of negotiations, the separate negotiating on early Friday mornings in the hope that the agreement late in the morning to sign quickly.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) have left the meeting angry.
It passed, however, still more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and first to 18:00 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have the company very much harm" and "it was a fear that the holidays at the end of the year would affect," Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road) and to 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rise from EUR 8,72 9,06 euros.
"This is not very much, but we are starting small in the first place," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists will now no longer need the care centres to block it.
"It will probably always some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF - chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult, "this wage increases to face international competition."
According to him, is the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and at 100 to 120 euros for the high income group.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) of "an historic agreement" language.
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about this "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3% and the upright stance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010 before it will allow in particular, the subject of 13 months in salary and the modernization of the collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "sinking of the levies on employers to the tune of 100 million euros' subject for an amendment to the bill the government the corrected finances for 2009, which was in the night from Thursday to Friday was adopted by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first on this organisation associated companies, and that they then applies in the event of an extension by the Minister for Employment for the entire profession.
This will "in a very short time" is the case, Bussereau insured.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR has denounced a "fraudulent trading", because the 100 million euro were "the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but about the geese, Esser to the approaching Christmas day not to verdriessen, laments the Unostra.
For the Association of Otre threatens the agreement "to small and medium-sized companies in the sector in the next 12 months to a large tomb schaufeln."

The SNCF, the care of travellers by officials and security forces had planned, pointed out that in the Saint Lazare station to no bottlenecks.
The SNCF line on the outermost regions from or towards the A Cergy - Le, skin on or drive trains run came from on the station Saint Lazare there, at the end of the metro, guaranteed.

For many years it was regarded as a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded secret site for defence research.
Today, the town hall with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres away from Moscow Centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Important research and production for micro- and Nanoelektronik is here.
Ever since September 2008 representatives Selenograds had contacts with the Frankfurt science sites linked with the Uniinstituten Riedberg - and the firms of the Frankfurt innovation centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt and signed a "protocol on closer cooperation."

It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed in the growing Russian market gain a foothold.
Conversely want Russian science firms in Germany garner contracts.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include around the Moscow Institute of electron technology, the big corporations and Sitronics Rosssijskaja Elektronika.

Stuttgart a brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not set high enough.
For the proponents of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe."
right. S21 is much more than the deeper set of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in chaos ludicrously construction site.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's appeared.
head station with tracks, right in the middle of the city, then ended were seen as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, such as brake of a modern rail transport appeared, as it was once an enormous amount of time needed, locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen.
reaping, brief, further driving so soll´s.
And why should the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, approximately half route on the trans-European rail Magistrale between Paris and is therefore Budapest/Bratislava - the slogan "the heart of Europe".
S21 will now be tackled effectively, although the visions of the 1980s by no longer compatible with reality.
Even more ambitious planners have recognised that the hessischen and the Bavarian city is almost priceless, implement the deeper lay.
But head stations have no more, exit problems and since it modern Wendezüge with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
However, the ICE: Stuttgart 21 Principles and building new route after Ulm - will be addressed now.
State and local politicians have it enforced.
The railway power with, because the risks of the largest infrastructure - individual projects of the Republic and not the taxpayer bears the state corporations.
urban can reasonably justify the project.
It creates new city space - believes one of the computer generated graphics of the planners, is endowed with much green.
For the transport system rail is S21 harmful.
The transit stations and the route expansion are intended for the movement, which one - typically 1980s - attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition from budget airlines.
modern transport policy, but first comes to freight traffic, to strengthen because of transportation by rail is significantly cleaner than by lorries on the road.
But the new construction lines because of intense climb taugt not for freight trains.
Far more serious is that S21 also indirectly affected many other rail projects.
Well six billion euros in Schwäbischen verbuddelt should be.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
What is clear is that in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and close, within the network is missing.
Overall 60 more projects are on the list of Transportation.
One of the most important is the development of better 180 kilometres long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, on the route in slow motion pace being built.

But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintalstrecke will for the bottle necks for international freight: right in the heart of Europe.

However, may also have played a role, the ZDF - Intendanten Markus Schächter not further damage, should this proposal to the board of directors do not get through.
Frey, Schächters candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 Gremiummitglieder.
The outcome of the vote was in editorial end of this edition is not yet clear.
Two weeks ago was Schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender for another five years, the Board failed.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders Abwahl was a bitter defeat for a erwartbare Schächter, however.
For the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not wanting to confirm in office.
had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the news of the ZDF lost to audience ratings, rejected him another term of hochangesehenen editor-in-chief.
Until just before the election, there were therefore protests, in which political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Most recently, even 35 states rights activist in the debate, interfered's action as unconstitutional Koch estimated.
It has benefited from nothing.
In person
Peter Frey was on 4 August 1957, born in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanistik.
After that, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurt round display.
1983 Frey changed the ZDF, first on the "Today", Journal.
subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal officers of the editor-in-chief; 1991-92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998, head and facilitator of tomorrow "until 2001;" magazine, head of ZDF / foreign policy; since then, head of ZDF, Studio City.
The Greens announced after the Abwahl Brenders, on Wednesday by the industry Journal medium magazine for journalists of the year, was elected to a constitutional complaint.
Koch adversary on the board, the Rhineland - pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said in the past week that countries should the ZDF - State Treaty change so that staff proposal of the intendant not by a politically motivated majority can be blocked.
An excerpt of party politicians from the supervisors of the ZDF came from Beck, however.
Peter Brenders likely successor Frey had the Board with a wise move, recommended by the body immediately after the Brender Abwahl - sharply criticized.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was both Schächter without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief nominate and elect the board of directors, without the suspicion, a supporters to lever to office.
In the party arithmetic is attributed to the left-wing liberal Frey anyway.
studies of clearing will
partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Ministers of the countries on Thursday finally: At a meeting of Ministers of Education and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to study conditions at the Bachelor and Master of wanting to improve.
The students should be able to, in the future, also be able to cope with their studies.
In each, they agreed to the test burden to reduce each study modules: In principle should only with a single examination concluded.
Moreover, the workload of the students checked and "a realistic and acceptable level" will be guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want the recognition of audit services between the universities within and outside Germany simplified.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
That divergent national rules should also do not exist.
Less trials
Since the start of the student protests in June of Culture bear and Uni / rector of the dictum of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now, for the first time, with a specific substance.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided, the number of audits in part to drastically reduce: "Each module includes usually with only one examination from," it says in a 30 pages of paper that the admission of some new courses to be regulated.
With the "clear reduction in the burden of assessment", said the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit seriously compromised."
Moreover, the "Studierbarkeit" future "the decisive criterion" in the design.
modules as content are "strictly to review whether," then "unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of
events "to be avoided.
The students' claim that margins would have to maintain the initiative to enable and promote. "
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "– all of which means that it lasts until 2015, all courses were reviewed.
competent for Federal far ten accreditation agency, which is the subject of the countries established Accreditation Council.
The Ministers had the countries in October "strongly urged" to put pressure on the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too stringent verification regime.
In some Länder, universities and technical colleges with the State Department already agreed to take appropriate measures.
The so far single country said in Rhineland Palatinate, for the further development of the Bologna process, additional funds.
The money should the colleges especially Tutorenprogramme set up and study advisory and Prüfungs - and strengthen foreign office.
country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
In early 2010 wants the government a Novelle of university law submitted to parliament.
After this is for the conclusion of a study model only one examination is necessary.
The study design should be more flexible, in addition to the appreciation of performance evidence of other universities and guaranteed access to the master easier.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country on their Studierbarkeit reviewed.
Government and opposition have had on Thursday again about the study conditions in the land dispute.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Bureau of Juso - university groups called for the design of future education policy should not be "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rector took place.
No later than after the educational strike should now also the students as "affected a say."
support the future graduates received by the President of the university rector Conference (HRK), Margaret winter coats: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the culture ministers, with which the HRK on a joint reform paper advised.
The union Education and Science (GEW) went the Bonn decisions as a whole does not go far enough: It calls for a legal right, each graduates with a Bachelor - complete access to a secondary Masters possible.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor - Master study places students with the best possible conditions tomorrow enough courses available, so GEW - a member Andreas cellar.
The countries need to hire more professors.
At a freer access to the master said the Ministers of Education, however, does not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany, comment from is beautiful and almost no control... "reads the start line of a poem of the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language snatches the Ankunftserfahrung of dissidents, addressed the freedom won, but at the same time has lost its language.
The 1951 born in Romanian Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as teachers worked in a children's book publishers before it moves in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literary prize, 1993, the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Mousonturm Hessischen literary forum in Frankfurt.
For major except literary high-profile worried last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, which deals with "Germans literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitateakten".
clearly unsettled and relocate Söllner read out a statement in which he above rumäniendeutschen writers' colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation and for the Romanian secret service, the Securitate admit.
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language prices.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate are not enough."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is in Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of hail from Romania German authors, shaken by a case of the abyss and the Niedertracht a political system makes recognizable on monitoring and spying is based.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, after previous knowledge, not just perpetrators, but victims.
In his Securitate - acts have in Walter played a role, said after the confession Söllners literature scholar Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence for him in the Walter.
He did it in all for him was difficult points "herausgehauen," Markel.
It is a moral need, this comment to make.
Söllners statement was in form and before this audience unexpected, completely surprising is the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany is a cosy reserves for Securitate informer, had already been Herta Müller in July at the time, having written their own acts, 914 sides, had read.
The affected, so we must presume, speculation and, in some cases, may even have known what clear name behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter hide.
Unlike the zulande here today very procedure safe account of Stasi's files, dealing with the legacy of the Securitate - monitoring more diffuse.
A systematic investigation has in recent years been thwarted and disabled.
One of the Birthler Agency in accordance with National Council for reappraisal of the Securitate - files (CNSAS) was first established in 1999, the publication of the files, however, has proceeded more slowly since then.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania are still very large, documented after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller of an interview in which a former Securitate, head of Temesvar derogatory about the winner said.
They have a psychosis, finally did it just once interrogated.
The Infamie power here said quite openly in the form of expression able to comment.
Certainly attached to the case Söllner, as so often in connection with silent guilt, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The measured response to the Zuhörenden Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than drive by apportioning of blame and shame will be determined.
To Genese the plant of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
saturation beilage Champions League
It works as a smart because it would just external dienstler dressed by a very nice Christmas party, at a sports goods manufacturers Goodies had distributed, as the new VfB - coach Christian Gross accompanied by an orange plastic bag of equipment a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class stieg. ¨
The man with the distinctive Glatze was because of him chauffieren still unfamiliar city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive themselves - alcohol was not in the game and eventually besoffen before luck was the 55 year-old as little.

Or good first Los.
In the words of the first three days earlier pledged Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final, namely" in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be fooled by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" stand on the Sunday before.
Then, in Mainz the royal class performance in the league - to life again.
And certainly revealed weaknesses again after the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and (11) Pogrebnyak to remedy.

The eighth final of Champions League (Hinspiele 16-17 + 23-24 February / back game 9./10. + / 17 March) will on 18 December draw lots in Nyon.
The joy on the fulminanten remained below the Babbel's successor, behaviour.
Not only the supposed cure, the bringer of uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time, dedication and self-confidence have given game of pleasure.
I have received on the players and I have told them that they should reflect on its strengths, and have encouraged them to be brave soul plumber Gross, said the simple sounding recipe, which under therapists Babbel but more had had no effect.
He has a certain magic, were sparked Babbel, Jens Lehmann to supporters, "if in football is a new boost, sometimes things happen, which is not thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of injury break thanks to its dynamic equal to the best players on the place, becoming tried the identified "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors to describe: "He is a man of action and discipline requires.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warning of sport Horst Heldt board
The VfB Stuttgart needs but especially Konstanz.
As Gross is also wary because players and managers before that the victory against a substitute weakened and completely overwhelmed defenses of the Romanian guests completely overstated.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in the Leverkusen 0:4 evil awakening has come, Khedira had to consider.
And sports executive Horst Heldt warn that a seasonal objective has been achieved, the other is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.

Even that is free day after games had been deleted, Lehmann interpreted as a sign of lack of sovereignty and Missgunst.
Lehmanns statements are "of pure selfishness, marked" keilte Heldt back and announced the consequences for the final men.
You will probably not friends for life more, the two forty years.
After all, but were they with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the team of trainers replaced the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a big share of the success," said Heldt Lehmann and of voices - and the man with the plastic bags to vote.
World Cup, Fight in the heavyweight
heated duel in Berne: Time and again provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavyweight, title to the WBC version.
The judgment of Punktrichter fell from unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box - in the heavyweight world champion.
The 38 year-old champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the night on Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).

Prior was the Ukrainians twice the WBO and WBC world champion associations.
Unfortunately, it has with the K.o. all the expected, have not worked.

The 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, before the duel of the end of Klitschko era had announced to cut but always the blows of the world champions, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial to the objective can bring.
In fact the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and attempted only through the rounds.
While he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely.
After all, he is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds is gone.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital made for some confusion.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly" zombie, "not right".

I have in this fight is only a blow abbekommen and am physically very good in form, Klitschko had the quick return to the ring justified.
His dream remains but the unification of all four major titles in the family.

Supposedly whose Promotiongesellschaft already now planning the fight against Klitschko Wembleystadion in London.
Kunduz case
frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair described as a liar.
SPD and Left calls for explanation of the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition, Defence Minister Karl Theodor - to Guttenberg (CSU) suggested a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol lorry in September "knowingly the falsehood," said Jürgen Trittin said Greens group leader on Saturday in the ARD television news show "-" days.
It cites the landläufig: He has lied.
The order to kill was in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) had been granted.
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack not just a destruction of the abducted vices, but also about two Talibanführer targeted to kill.
In the German Kunduz - commander Colonel Klein requested US air raid, according to NATO Survey were up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, SPD and Left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to to comment immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what really Guttenberg had known about the incident.
Mrs Merkel should clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government is and whether Chancellery, armed forces and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, called Jürgen Trittin, Mrs Renate Künast and Greens.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm has strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery was not on specific missions of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan influence, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry about the background of the dismissal of General inspectors Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert louder.
According to information in the mirror, the two Guttenberg correctly and fully about the background of the tank vices - attack informed.
Officially, it means that they have the existence of NATO reports and denied the minister denied sensitive details.
For the environment of the two top officials said, however, that the Defense Department even referred to several reports, including a two-way document of the warrant prosperous Colonel Klein and a field hunters report.
Wichert is now in a letter asking for clarification of the facts, "the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sunday newspaper reported."
A reply has not been received, they say.
The Ministry expressed on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that the committee of the Bundestag shall be resolved, the next Wednesday will be constituted.
dream world
Some see in awake state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurred the boundaries between reality and imagination.
Until it happens in sleep, everything is in order.
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should Unbound the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden indulge in.
Anyone who has seen the dream in the awake state, however, knee-jerk, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, applies in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drugs, at least as Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only with mental health or drug binge.
fault has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, pictures to paint or write novels, sometimes to ensure that the border between dream and reality blurred, madness.
dream knee-jerk modified awake state of consciousness can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Although cause and effect may be different, the visions of Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age - prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations but due to similar processes.
hallucinations or delusions that arises when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - especially Dopamin, Noradrenalin, serotonin and Acetylcholin derail - and the interaction of various brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts occur more frequently during a schizophrenic psychoses.
The gravity has no power more about him
The connection of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since antiquity employees.
Aristotle concept of hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted a "great similarity of 1861 is wrong with the dream state, for" Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, cow education, such a" sense of deception.
It is autumn of 2001, when he turned in a comic strip characters T. Henning.
His body is two one-dimensional and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging on the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him saying vicious form with blood red, distorted Fratzen zähnefletschend,.
They hunted him, joined him with serious, flammenden boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the entire body.
Loud, virulent voices roar from walls and Radio.
He can no longer tolerate it, the voices that he insulted and offended.
Henning T. tore two cable from the stereotypes they plant, knot a noose and fortified them in a hooks in the ceiling.
He is rising on a loudspeakers and observed the noose around the neck.
jumping.
The noose resolves itself.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices shouting in drums fur zerfetzend chorus, "go in the clinic and let your cure!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, experienced the last is 2 years back, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive - paranoid psychosis, is also his manic depressive, - he takes medication to combat depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years, he is married.
In the psychosis, I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The mirage are cruel reality
About one percent of the population infected at least once in life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, they will be second most common disease treated after the Depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychoses affected mostly can no longer distinguish between domestic and external world, they are entering a übererregten state, hallucinations, sizes, Beziehungs - or persecution mania can lead to.
Particularly popular is the voice heard - voices ordering, or comment on dialogisieren.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is not more important from unimportant, to separate the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness of impression will be flooded.
As the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a torrent of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes come from.
The reality of perception in the psychosis is zentriert entity, says Professor Thomas fox, head doctor of the clinic for general psychiatry in the university clinics Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the scene, everything has focused on its importance.
At the same time equipment in a passive role, it is similar to the dream of the events overwhelmed and can not make them active.
schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality of matching it is usually not possible, the mirage are cruel reality, wake up excluded.
Once in life to have experienced a hallucinations
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "remains but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, in which perceived the psychosis, basically."
The wahnhaften thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in the reality that the Verfremdung experience will take place in real terms instead.
Why exactly our brains beat antics, researchers still puzzle.
state of emergency in any people can lead to the reality short-lived loses, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes alone are not the determining factors.
Researchers assume that when those concerned have minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturing of the brain in an early stage of development, is disrupted by a viral the mother during pregnancy for example, fox explained.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neuronal system is reached, is also the first on many years did not reveal.
Even environmental factors play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger for psychosis if there is negotiable.
Even halluzinogene drugs because they can trigger psychosis in the Transmittersystem intervention.
If our brain hot runs
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs in order to get out, which, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich castes.
Whether fantasy as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of the position.
castes for ten years, collects reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen, last year, he has his findings in the book "The unreal world in our heads evaluated".
hallucinations may belong to the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include, besides mental disorders as Borderline or depression often illnesses such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's skull and brain trauma.
Surprisingly hallucinated under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
hallucinations, so castes, put together from memory content that would normally be withheld.
They arise when brain areas, which are processed sensory überaktiv or too little are obstructed; if our brains hot expires or if stimulation lacking.
Drugs can trigger this situation as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress and distress or other mental state of emergency.
In recent studies, up to one-third of the respondents, at least once in life to have experienced a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, you live in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended the grammar school there.
A normal girl, really.
If there is not the images and voices.
At the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
If he replies, the Mitschüler surprised to see it - nobody else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a day, but Sarah K. versponnene träumerin dreams, that they do not know.
She is awake, she hears and sees these boys, just as the girls in the bank sees and hears beside him.
You can even feel his presence, at least for those moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks sometimes.
But they know that this boy and the other fantasy is not real and disappear again.
night are the phenomena most frightening
Often, the fantasy is also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, it can sometimes do not follow the teaching materials, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new Mitschüler, while for all other hearing and visible from the blackboard mathematical equations explained.
night are the phenomena most frightening.
If you in her dark room to sleep is waiting for the much too little and much too late, they can often not distinguish whether it is already awake or dreaming, whether the pictures you see, the Fratzen or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds to poor and legs, before you open or closed eyes to emerge.
Let me in quiet, it shouts to the characters.
Parents and friends tells you nothing about it, they would keep for crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She has insisted the baccalaureate last year and lives with her friend together.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes has admitted that it knows well that it is not crazy.
obsession is also a work of art from despair
If someone is social isolation or withdrawal is under appeal, he has most probably after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and makes himself for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind had, as a little girl afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Your hallucinations began with 13, when she learned that the man they call Papa, since you can think of, not its leiblicher father is.
As for visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, real impressions and processed sounds, it is people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish, fantasy and reality. "Every experience," says castes, "will take place in the brain, the reality is taking place there.
hallucinations are also images of the brain can be created, why are they so real. "
Even night dream images ladies caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia are mentally healthy in the situation, their fantasy as unreal to recognize.
castes advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations also value as special ability.
Border state between dreams and hallucinations
In our more awareness zentriert world will unfortunately mostly pathologisiert imaginary experience, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy, the Florence Nightingale's hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it is also positive, creative / obsession is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experiences form a special form of dream knee-jerk modified awake awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed virtual dreams of Erlebende for real, and he also does not distinguish the awake state in hindsight.
The oneiroide state of consciousness is emerging in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example in Polyradikulitis - patients with full awareness of a motor paralysis experiencing.
If a person of self and world loss is threatened, for example by continuing to complete movements, he replaced the life-threatening reality by their own, imaginary world that decoupled from reality is, says Schmidt - Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dreams and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible, will take place a world of change, but instead of the real situation in the Imagination in mind.
An intensive form of sense Foundation and sense of legislation in itself in an intolerable situation that we allow people own design skills, not in a loss of consciousness submerged nothing.
Everything is real, later in the memory
Even the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his awareness for a heart valve operation, followed by a heart transplant for days go on trips, while his body to the intensive care to movement is doomed.
Claussen appears in a world created itself, a visiting alien times and places: He is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles, the drugs produced from blood.
Will a Greeks on motorcycle in his home country of abducted, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee hits the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely on the imaginierten happened, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel differ radically from each dream for Claussen.
dream is a different state, describes his experience.
Quite the contrary I have the memories from mental travel even after years and in marginal details overwhelming.
clear and intensive even seen as genuine.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other lives of worldly experience, says the psychiatrist Degenhard Schmidt.
Ultimately, show Oneiroide psychosis, hallucinations and drugs binge how fragile our internal reflects the external reality the guards are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist resümiert caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience that may well be enriching can be.
The snow fall may come

The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which we only can read his e-mails, a possibility certain annexes, without being able to see or through the Internet to surf.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame than the magazine Time to choose the products of the year.
There on the street to see, is unlikely, but the idea itself is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat-rate, for example, only half of the price of the iPhone a flat-rate.
After the company has seen the success that it has two new devices on the market: one, the only for Twitter is intended, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which it must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which yesterday at the event in Le Web presented, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries, as its counterpart, however, has a surprise pat.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those with a Smartphone to travel the world, already know what it means to abandon all the data to get his email to be able to read once one has ridden roughshod over the border or if you are desperate for a café with WIFI addiction or a link with Fon (opportunities).
The idea of roaming with flat-rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be long-standing is possible.
It is true that some telephone providers already specific contracts and prices for stays abroad to offer, but in my experience, you need a have doctorates in physics and a good glasses to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable Roamingtarife for Europe as a whole remains almost always ignored.
Outside the country, we always afraid that his email to read and rightly so.
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing is that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) these kind of tariffs could offer, means that the telephone providers is slowly but surely rethinking and must start, in various ways, to consider how they can use their data networks.
Kindle is another good example, in his prices is the Downloaden of books and other questions contained in the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
This is an Internet equipment and capable of paying for it only once, namely the purchase, and not every month.
And that is precisely what I do one day, expect a buying opportunity FonPeek with lifelong Internet access as the Peek offers already in the United States.
And that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my email with the telephone, thank you.
but I expect this, because I believe that there is an appropriate model for the consumer would be.
It would be interesting, even a computer with the same system can see.
The Fetish colours of Michelle
amber is undoubtedly the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
Even with the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and this has the same colour repeatedly elected to him in his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models account, except that it was almost the same color - a bright green yellow, stocks the clothes in three parts, dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and they contribute to something grossförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes as far as that at first sight it appeared that the First Lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to follow the same dress, on more than one occasion to account.
However, the two different clothes but much in the way of material from which they are produced.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and in Oslo a from gemusterten kid.
Even the accessories were different: the first time green footwear with half high (and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Even the hair was each time is different: The hair on this occasion as hair wreath lofty, with the previous wore their hair in the open.
75% of working mothers have given their babies problems in getting the work
The discrimination in the work has grown in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
To this result comes the of CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity restricted.
The study lays open that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women are working or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of them, no other activity outside the House do only halbtags, work or have no fixed contract, will soon be mothers and have more children.
By contrast, postponed the women with a solid job, especially in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and, therefore, have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed job got their first child on average only 3.7 years after the Zusammenziehen, a figure of 4.1 years for women with permanent jobs, increased the longer used to achieve this and their Zusammenziehen and the first child to have implemented until much later.
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the contraceptive preparedness, "explains the CSIC researcher, Margarita Gil-Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child to be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also among the women of the same age have been found.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether it is the primary school completion or a higher education have, on average, each with 25,1 32,1 or the first time mother.
There is also still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with major final completion before its first permanent employment marry and have their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school looking the other way around and only a permanent jobs and marry later and then get their first child, is firmly Gil-Delgado.

The trip is exciting and Vicent saves either to horrors or enlightenment.
Except that this book is a delicious les enjoyment, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are a few cuttings from the book.
For Albert Camus: "Reading his sides, I found out that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sinnlicher driving, just as I always have felt to have found without making words: The joy as opposed to the malign fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any sort of God."
For Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a big deal poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife blade, which nearly killed him."
For Graham Greene: "Our man was of this woman with a passion which lasted for thirteen years, so in their spell, whose meat is drawn in the emotions on the grounds of adultery is with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which is, in the sky along the route of the destruction to come."
For James Joyce: "The Ulysses" in 1922 in Paris was issued by Sylvia Beach. This is a the 8000er summit in the world literature, it must be in the northern wall hinaufklettern, on the wall, on the constantly anew the best mountaineers try. "
For William Faulkner: "The was a comic Kauz.
He said sometimes about itself that the heritage of the county would be a good owner and others times he has said that he is the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams shows a certain GröΒe. "
For Louis - Ferdinand Céline: This writer adopted the hideous cry on, of a bridge from those personality from Munich was hinausgeschrieen, thus echo until deep into the night of the 20th century to his literary way out echoes. That he made during a trip, on which he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the worm posterity beg.

For Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses of Spencer eingraviert: 'of sleep after the effort after the storm, / / the port, the calm after the war, after a / tired of life you find favor on death."
For Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she had also always her depression.
The husband took it with utter normality out, if you tell him that Eduard VII it between the Azaleen or spy on the birds sang in Greek.
There is not a single other case where the man known as much patience and love in a Neurotikerin, whose literary talent was still much gröΒer than it was folly. "
Over Pío Baroja: "What made Martín - Santos otherwise than to try to instil in Joyce Baroja?
What intended as Benet Baroja, when he failed to bring the arms of Faulkner?
What made Cela because, apart from the glory of that man to destroy themselves, so that he can put on this pedestal? "
cowardly aggression
My 70 year-old mother was last week through our district of Fuenlabrada stroll in the village, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, we have brought home from the animals and the just six kilos weighs, and then out of the blue you miss him two feet, and injured him so hard.
Our outrage is not in words, taken as it is incomprehensible to us, where because of the fun in a cheap Agression against a small and helpless animal, which is, of course, to the lifeline was carried out.
On top of the suffocation attack, a woman who was walking cosy, as they get these people as a result of the incident, they even wanted to reprimanding feared for their own lives, because if so insane attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps, with a woman, a child, an older Mr or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has long geheult throughout the day.
Of course we have nahgelegenen reimbursed in a police complaint, we have all but serious doubts as to whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we would only make clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened to us has led to this incident.
We can't understand what in the minds of these young people that they must take a cheap attack on a helpless animal find fun, on an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good upbringing and the respect for the animals and the people have stayed.
Michelin and Fesvial common for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, launched as both companies announced today.
This initiative wants to draw attention to the importance of helmet use because it is, ultimately, about the only protection elements, the head injury or even death in the case of a motorcycle accident can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its obligation in regard to safety, is the "far broader than just the design and manufacture of products, with each day is always safer" and reaffirmed further that it with other actions educational and informative nature contributed to this goal every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the use of motorcycle helmets, which, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will run in a first phase to distribute posters on 500 motorcycle workshops, so as to achieve the best possible spread.
Finally, Michelin stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and specifically from the bottom, since they are as a manufacturer of tyres for two - rädige vehicles are required to see that one of its main objectives the development of safer products must always be.
The sale of small trucks is rising again slightly in
After nearly two years of Automarkt finally begins for small trucks some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles in November in Spain were allowed, means an increase of 12.6 %in reference to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are so that the first increase even after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, according to the manufacturers' association and the car dealers' association Anfac Ganvam figures presented.
These good figures, however, are currently only with great caution to enjoy, as compared to the reference data used by November 2008, which are a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the whole of the authorisation of the 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles sold, in this number but are all vehicles, from which the small vehicle market is, contain: descendants of passenger cars, small trucks, Pick employees in relation to small vans and small wagen/fahr gestell lighter burden.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, which demand the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles will be purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, in which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third finance professionals.
So we must to these restrictions, which are the consequence of the credit tap turned off, are still include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of bad economic situation.
In this landscape, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little help.
This plan, however, is not only for certain individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have pointed a right, if they are up to 3.5 tonnes a smaller vehicle with a CO2 emissions, not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven may wish to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had again Ganvam recalled that it necessarily on the part of the state is necessary, including a special attention to this small vans and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealers association predicts for 2010 a similar year just as the last, for the loss it with a sales (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19% is calculated.
The support during braking maneuvers in critical situations is now duty
As was already in Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and as is now happening with the ESP stability control systems, to the relief of the brakes in case of emergency a duty equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all newly registered passenger cars and light small trucks, for the remaining vehicles, a maternity deadline set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union has adopted measures aimed to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these can brake system because of their operation also help to prevent many Auffahrunfälle.
The task of the emergency braking assistants is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system on the basis of the drivers said brake pedals, recognizes the strength to exert braking.
However, this system not exerting this pressure until the end.
According to one of the component manufacturers for the Bosch vehicles commissioned study, came one third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision, not even more so on the brake pedals to enter and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1 000 accidents
The braking aid against attacks with maximum force in the braking and this will reduce the brake time and hence the braking distance of a car travelling in the braking process.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1 000 fatal accidents in which pedestrians to damage will be avoided if all cars with this kind of emergency braking assistants were equipped.
It would be even fewer accidents - one expects every fourth accident involving personal injury can be prevented - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking system popularity.
Then there is the vehicle equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and recognizes the driver warns, while at the same time have a slight pressure exerts on the brakes.
If the driver responded helps him, then the system here, the pressure on the brake pedals, to increase if there would be needed.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the collision was inevitable, the braking assistants exerting the maximum pressure on the brakes to the damage in this way to minimise.
General Motors is postponing the plan for Opel to January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) already by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, were informed that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, shows the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to the rescue plan for Opel to conclusion.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wanted to ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it might be that the final document, the first of the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, there will be submitted by early 2010, will be postponed.
Dementgegen by GM will be assured that, in the coming days a decision regarding the sale of Saab will take.
Since it is not surprising that the Swedish government pressure on the American Autobauer has increased, so that as soon as possible a decision.
GM exists, with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers might also like Geely, the Volvo bought, would, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper - sports cars, the Russian group Converg backing, has always been strong support.
If it with any of these buyers should come to an agreement, could GM some assets to China's BAIC sell.
The decision, Saab to close at the end of the year if not before then, it has been sold, will also continue.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder on tax
For the development of their new and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and create, But really it at 80 kilos of easier to make, and he is now only 1.275 kilos on the scales.
In order to create something, they refrained from the first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, the screen through a tent roofs with manual accord was replaced, so that alone was 21 kg; saved thanks to this model, aluminium doors used as the GT3 "disappear" by another 15; the exclusion of the air conditioning again 13; it was also the fuel tanks from 64 to 54 litres were reduced, thus further 7 kilo saved; through the installation of sporting Bacquet - seats again 12 and with the slight 19 - customs Felgen five saved again.
Then there was even through the renunciation of the audio system CDR - 30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of doors grip from substance abuse by the lack of kilo achieved.
Although he also with the double kupplung Driven PDK is available, was the test ride with a vehicle with 6 - current hands held Driven mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes that are really very kurvig ran.
During his behaviour we can give him only the note impeccable.
The reduction of his weight, but by no means will he geführtdass now no longer so sure it would be on the streets.
It is rather the opposite is the case: For long we have not added a small and easily model probegefahren, this one but also a feeling of great security in the Kurven, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders, to lawn, too slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out...
He makes everything, he says. The car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel indicated, thanks to his management, just as communicative as precise.
And he makes it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can still raise it with the 'sports' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which have already been used in the Panamera came first.
The acceleration of assets is incredibly brutal, whether from the stand out or to further accelerate.
The Federungen are strong but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads, on which we have with the Boxster Spyder, drove was pretty damaged, but the car handle the blow hole.
The electronic assistants on the whole route had almost nothing to do; and that, although we in some of these Kurven ice in the dawn and rolling splitt found this morning.
In summary, it can be said that there is an ultra light car, a car, with which it has an indescribable Fahrspass, as it would otherwise rather rare, and it is much more than just a small improvement in the Boxster S.
The car in February 2010 will come on the market and costs EUR 70.831.

The singer, a Gulf friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco starlett Cocoon and an opportunity for the fashion show of 'maison,' she presented her evil face with the same Halsstarrigkeit as their pockets of Chanel.

The Baskonia paying themselves a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrating, despite the many players have been in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, a brilliant victory with 82 - 91 during his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and is therefore on the first place within his group after the magnificent appearance of Teletovic Mirza, the eight three times with the best of his team was (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria, the major defaults of Herrmann, Oleson Micov Huertas, or by a large dose of dedication and team work, even if they replaced until the bitter end had to wait on their victory.
The great hits from the Perimeter out with 16 valued at three times contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue red, from the beginning to the top on the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Perimeter came out, you might have to indicate that they are on the playing field with good aufgewärmten hand joints had arrived.
There were English and Teletovic mainly for the 18 to 20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava themselves for a home side game of Barac ruled and for the game by Eliyahu, on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause was received, which is home to their advantage before the break further develop (34 / 43).
Teletovic already began, as the best of his team with 13 points, also highlight wennn "minus six" assessment of cluster can already guess that this not the best evening of Brazilians.
But it was the game despite the clear advantage at the break and still not decided the Makkabäer Vitorianer wanted to remind you once again that not everyone wins on their pitch and, thanks to the constant angreifenden "hand of Elías" they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini are central to that the "Yellow" turned the helm (50 to 49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, has had a couple of games with meeting safety guidelines prepared to return to get air and in one of them came from the gun suddenly Mirza Teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensure that on the scoreboard again a reassuring distance of (54 / 67) was reported, the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57, 67) can make.
The Alavesen last quarter were exposed and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) has announced that it would allow anyone to them the victory in the first thirty minutes honestly deserved to take away again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried not to back their team by three points from the line (70 / 77) force.
Nevertheless, and despite mote because of foul of the place was asked, were not on the team by Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis still in the last minute to catch up (80 - 85), had the game already a winner and Tel Aviv, lost for the first time in this season.
injuries prevent Unicaja stood up to be offered
Unicaja lost vociferously against Olympiacos in Greece and had the lead in group B of the Euro League to cede to him, and that, in a game that by defaults on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game was marked, what the Greeks facilitated the victory.
The team from Malaga have no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game presented in first quarter should start to dream Andalusier. A aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive triple, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12 - 18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos, of the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a home match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22 / 20 in their favour, indicate the minute, following a campaign in which it almost to the brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and so would have both been disqualified.
The Greek team are starting to finally become warmer and its superiority in both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland because of a violation and the three themselves errors caused by Carlos Jiménez clear traces left at the Unicaja.
Under their players in the domestic fields and the Lithuanian before players Linas Kleizas, with his three times, increased their advantage in the 19th minute on 44 / 32.
A catch up was impossible
The third Spielviertel are characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, despite his 19 losses showed superior and even create the difference of in Malaga, fought game with 66 - 48 in the 27th minute, which in turn offset the leadership within the group brought to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to take on the many defaults and the departure of during the game injured Scots Robert Archibald disregard.
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three times by Cook and the use of Lewis back some hope to 66 - 57.
Nevertheless, it was in fact impossible, since the Olympiacos as soon as he attacks and his superiority with centimeters in the basket area showed that was not to hold.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37. minute basket differences on 81 - 62 Unicaja rising and had to be beaten and had to surrender the leadership anOlympiacos.

After the enticing of all days since last spring, at which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets was, is on the markets again returned the insecurity, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on inherently uncertain future meetings.
The measure used to stabilize the markets it was that the debt with the direct purchase of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly to allow a free hand in interest rates, which are about zero move, so that in this way the banks to buy assets accounted for.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets are as good as finished, and without their heterodox policy to liquidity into question, start to throw some sand into the wheels, like the BCE näc already delude ourselves with its annual auction next week.
So the investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures to maintain and we are just witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and the differences in the Unternehmensboni is rising again, even if it is still far from the paranormalen amounts, which they reached at the beginning of the year.

Spain has until now barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is damaging to the defenders of moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy, an awareness of what had caused it to produce them, since the devastating effects, to which the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as it is actually a new day of thanks to action should have decided.
