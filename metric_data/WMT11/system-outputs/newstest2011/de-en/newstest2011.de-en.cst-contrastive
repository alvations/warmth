What can you do, the čssd? the Czech social democrats in Prague know neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei."
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously certain language barriers, have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung able to understand at all.
The newspaper has aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the čssd time a little 'abgeklopft', as they dominate the notorious slang, over the past few years has become established, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, the in the verflossenen era of Lord Mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, is some of the most prominent players, situations and causae entlehnt.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark.
The claim they at least.
"who is voldemort?"
'No idea. "
'I am a newcomer to the Prague policy', responded lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes."
But also the ratsherr Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the concept of 'golfloch. "
"That is the only expression of which, I am here to present to you, which I use and again."
"otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang."
From the vocabulary of the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the wahlkongress the ODS had published, pickte the editors six concepts, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague Government.
The Social Democrats should the terms' voldemort ',' greatest Prague golfloch ',' in the konditorei go ',' stiernacken, "" betrayal of capital 'and' verblechen "define.
Three Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised firstly of its participation in the discussion, but then not time the listeners.
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test in from the outset.
I do not care 'these things are and how the Civic Democrats with each other, about judgments I not. "
'What is important to me, as we understand our programmes, "he made.
As has already been indicated, would have lukáš kaucký in the aforementioned headline allegedly not realised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek.
The term 'voldemort kaucky "says absolutely nothing, and the only one that he was correct erriet on the test," the greatest Prague golfloch. "
"That is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to the security but still: 'but I know more in the newspaper'.
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs show must."
The "golfloch" will then not only of matador Karel Březina, but also by the ratsherrn on the Environment lukáš plachý appropriate as a tunnel blanka entziffert.
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term voldemort lukáš plachý senses and even, where this figure is to be found, and also, what it means is that "in the konditorei to go."
"I believe, that is to say, in any Prague gastronomiebetrieb ', is to go plachý quite close to the conundrum hit solution, when we know that this is the seat of janoušeks firms.
In line with Březina claimed it but, this knowledge in the papers drawn strength rather than to have him this vocabulary board would be.
Judging by the testteilnehmern under the Social Democrats, it seems, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang.
'I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there are we really not. "
"We call on us in the name and again we also use words or nicknamed ', says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - of his party colleague, casual" hulda'.
'in the school was I bříza (birke) mentioned, but I do not know whether I am also my fellow Members call', tells us Karel Březina his nicknamed.
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried and see as - he works.
Ratsherr weinert is for the party colleague, enough of the "OPA 'or less friendly of the' old ', the representative Miroslav poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring vocal, some colleagues' igráček" (known Czech lego-figur).
Nicknamed are as the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language.
It may not hulínský supposedly if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered a other nicknamed the Prague chairman.
His nickname 'doctor of the gummiknüppel-rechte supposedly "has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský its title doctor Juris to the bratislaver police college has acquired.
The government wants the torture of "witches' prevent out and was a brochure
Women, who in Burkina Faso witches have to be labelled, usually some common social characteristics.
They are more part of the older generation to, you cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are constraint and have no children.
If one of these women to hexe "will ', will it strictly isolated, so that the rest of the village not can be dangerous.
'men are quite rare affected by this fate. "
"also young and healthy women remains, since this will save them in the work and help bear children ', a ordensschwester describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a spezialheim by more than a hundred women represents, who have been expelled from their communities.
The ortsregierung decided now, against this abnormal "sozialmaßnahme '.
And, for this reason, a brochure, which is designed to prevent the 'hexenverfolgung'.
The matter but has a catch.
"more than 70% of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read ', instructed the newspaper' derstandard" on the dilemma of the written information.
To be accused of witchcraft, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, was the 27-jährige ammy hemmahová of three women and two men tortured to death - it alight you with petroleum and simply.
On this incident reported, including the server BBC.
The perpetrators claimed, however, the matter would be only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version is oil inflamed, which will be used to ritual salbungen.
And, after the group have tried, "a bad spirit 'from the Mrs' 's good health '.
The isolation of "witches' support the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year old entrepreneurs from Burkina Faso: "fresserinnen human souls are today as in the past a risk," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso, at least try to defuse the witch hunt, the gambianische President last year the President himself mitgemischt properly.
"President yahya jammeh stirring up after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch hunt, since these supposedly share of their death and were now to try, including the President himself by black magic kill."
He called 'to schamane from the middle Guinea to assistance, the accompanied by police, soldiers and the bodyguard of President indiscriminately detainees women and men from gambianischen villages kidnapped and on the farm of the President in kanilai brought', led the organisation Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, people have been forced from prison, a absud from plants with halluzinogener effect to drink, but also a bowel and nierenprobleme.
Two of the arretierten people survived the residence on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners have been released.
A tenants of bakala: It revives in the foot, but nevertheless pays higher rent
An older untersetzter man is leaving the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, of the largest privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
A file under the poor with three new mietverträgen to three homes: for the own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is a sentence.
All three within the framework of the so-called 'deregulation' just the rent increased.
Instead of SEK 3 500 monatsmiete is the son in the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with cuisine of the second category of SEK 4100 berappen.
'and there is in the home not time a fluent hot water and heating must be in a simple kohleofen', for he angry pointing the finger at the new mietvertrag of the son, to the signing of which he has a power.
'But what - who I signed, "he says half and half resignedly annoying.
Bytyokd.cz's citizens' Association, the new mietbedingungen as "incorrect and immoral," the tenants, the new Treaties simply not to sign and until 7 December in which it intends to publish a guidance as to how to take action against such treaties.
But the man beckons only.
'A says this, and the other is the', makes it a benighted face.
The region will Ostrava so much "deregulierungslabor."
After the new year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants no market-oriented rent figures.
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" personally.
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region and Ostrava already nine o'clock in the morning in this Tuesday brechend fully.
Alongside the door the bodyguards a safety agency and to her a aufrufgerät.
'rent 2011, "is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen.
Briefly touched upon this and already the machine spuckt a nummernzettel.
We hardly have the number '157 "entziffert and already piepst you on the large screen an indication to the ceiling of the warteraums.
Half a minute later is one's turn.
A little later enter an older married couple the warteraum after the rent to questions, but the rush in warteraum is obviously not the new rent.
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - reparaturanträge, insurance and so on.
From the middle of November fly in the region the Ostrava kuverts with the new mietverträgen most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of rpg in the letter boxes.
The rpg byty proposes to you in the letters a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38%.
The specific switch to the new rent in the klientenzentrum is opened since 18 November.
"The action is something over a week, that is to say, this is only the beginning," answers the honourable behind the counter hesitate for a moment, as the 'legal' as a journalist dictator.
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the from Ostrava deputy speaker he lubomír zaorálek originating from the čssd taken up this issue very loudly, no wonder that, today, the newspapers are full of this.
Twenty years of "I want to you a new floor."
'not time ne besch. Wc-brille they could change', makes the aforementioned man air.
Up to now, according to the staff, are particularly pensioners switch to in order to convince the promised mietermäßigung, whether they really received rpg promises you, if you sign the spezialangebot in good time.
The benefit of a half reduced februarmiete should also the other tenants, which the new mietvertrag by 15 December.
Up to now is' deregulierungsschalter "in havířov but everything other than overloaded of follow-up questions.
'from yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011, because here' value the schalterbeamtinnen.
Rpg offers both on their websites, as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary.
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent some, will you of an independent court.
"that is not a threat, but as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," says rpg on its web sites.
"This is no one in court," says one of the workers from rpg byty and a man on the street before the klientenzentrum is their right, at least in part.
"I have welcomed 13, 000 (crowns) pension, I remain 5,000 to eating left, where I should the money for a gerichtsstreit come from," he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
"time."
'Mr zaorálek says you on the media, they should not sign and waiting for it to the people even' are you to bear in mind.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to new year 2011 and, according to the mieterhöhung rpg byty is an economic necessity.
"the existing level of rent is not enough time to the maintenance of the wohnfonds from ', argues Pavel klimeš, the director of the wohnungs-portfolios society rpg byty and - particularly of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of the wohnungsfonds is, in the opinion of the main reason for the mieterhöhung homeowners.
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 collected from the rent four billion could invest in the homes, in the four years from 2011 until 2014, is it to be 5.2 billion.
On the großformatigen lcd-display to the ceiling to the polstersesseln in warteraum of havířov appear again and again in a few red shining information.
"The mieterhöhungen in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of rpg."
This means "always at most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month ', is on the lcd-monitor to read.
Only in 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg has increased the rent by 38%.
"in these cases it is the increase in extremely low mietpreise of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argued rpg.
In 2600 housing remains the rent in the next year at the same level.
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rent not in leaps and bounds, but gradually within four and eight years ago.
What is more, the company is imposed on a further obligation: all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung (see graph), the companies in the homes are again, particularly in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But, primarily, those who benefit from the people, the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
The architects saw a - the office is also a nursery
The office buildings avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company arch.design.
But who would expect a minikindergarten here, with all what this includes: farbenfrohen walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse.
This nursery school is since last year the staff of arch.design available.
The projektierungs- and architekturbüro arch.design, from whose ateliers a whole series of eminent brünner buildings, expected of the first drafts for the new building avriopoint to with the premises for his firmen-minikindergarten.
Wise in, because most of its 90 staff (within) are in babyboom-alter and the company is keen that the projektantinnen as quickly as possible and architektinnen returning to work.
Together with the opportunity to work, reduced, is the nursery another bonus, the arch.design its employees in the concept of their sozialprogrammes to offer.
The bauingenieurinnen and -architektinnen have it so easier, its ambitious work and the care of children.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of staff (within) by arch.design and with the support of the management managed financial assistance from the European Union and of the Ministry of work and Social Affairs for their project to win.
The occupational minikindergarten by means of the operationsprogramm human resources and employment policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the state reacts to the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of EUR 2, 8 million CZK) allowed the necessary facilities and the equipping procured and for the period of two years for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the utilisation of the funds (2 years) is the society arch.design committed to the minikindergarten 3 years to at their own expense.
The preparation of this project, a whole year, and the society economy rating in the antragsabwicklung active assistance.
The children are ganztätig qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin, the kindergarten school children can visit without altersmäßige restrictions, although most of you on three years old.
And, because there is a mini-kindergarten only 5 children, must be present at the same time, however, the day change over a number of children from each other.
The kindergartenbetrieb is flexible in the needs of parents voted, the children of all staff have in relation to the use of the kindergartens the same rights - without regard to the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the programminhalt in mini-kindergarten nevertheless, comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education brings.
The children play not only here, above all, will you excellent teaching needed - of basic knowledge to vorschulunterricht, incidentally, they still learn English.
Not only is the classroom and creative play with toys, but also with a computer, of the children is available.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company is contributing to a kind and positive firmenmilieu.
Parents can at any time, a look at the children, and so is the stress during late, take the children from a far-off nursery school.
That is why the parents use of their working time more productive.
No wonder that this also natural and loyal relations are developing.
Arch.design included so under the Czech firms, the in the recruitment of new staff to provide significant benefits ," the family-friendly by such programmes are and their personnel marketing.
A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years. If you look at the interieure of Gaudi to
The roof seems to be as the backs of prehistoric echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler.
That is the Casa batlló of Catalan architects Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants experienced the House with its organic forms the nicknamed "knochenhaus."
Organic forms, wild paints, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and to shed "jigsaw creating false fronts and ubiquitous soft lines, all this are typical features for the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the House is playing with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and living beings.
Only if we look carefully noted that everything of geometry rhythm and profound order dominated.
In the night, the whole façade still plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the House.
Creates ripple geformtes wood being copied the window frames, support, zierelemente of doors, even gucklöcher and.
The House batlló in quarter eixample in a crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese said.
The reconstruction, two years and was concluded detailed.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he voted the idea gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The mietshaus Casa outlined batlló Antoni Gaudí, however, not only.
He worked with the architects José Maria jujol together.
It is precisely on the drawing board the dekorationen created for representative home of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaiken to the façade was his idea.
In the design of the façade worked also, however, many other bildner and artists with.
The joint work of the drafts of the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí.
So jujol also participated in the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in the park güell, where the further work by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion experienced the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknamed "knochenhaus."
Others called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House '.
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of holy Georg, of the existence of Catalonia.
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí outlined for the House for the time unique zentralheizungssystem with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen.
A little bizarre is their 45-grad-neigung already.
In his create Gaudí consistently ignored all then building regulations and could not be deterred by this.
Before baubeginn Holte it from the city of the appropriate planning a but the claims made on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the implementation so horrified by the result was that they were asked to remedy.
The ratsherren is met with, among other things, that the construction, with its pillars, even in the public pavement intervention.
To amendments, we, however, not more, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the call of the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request for approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and it has been granted him promptly.
The homeowner itself, in the lower echelons of a.
In the gallery, in 2 stock was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and privaträume of housing.
The ground floor was a juweliergeschäft leased.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a stairs, right up to the dachterrasse.
Through the fundamental elements of the adaptation were all right corner and dead straight lines and removed and replaced by gebogene geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of places.
The social part is, by opening the salontüren completely and, therefore, a large society convenient plaudern, without in vertraulicheren talks on a certain degree of privacy.
The House was given by gaudís restructuring out of a new front also a rather unusual thing roof and two further floors.
Impressive is also gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and White glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard packets is and the lichthöfe.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum of light.
In this he made simply to take advantage of the principle that know better reflect the light, as a dark paints, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb.
The House Casa batlló, the 2005 in the welterbe-liste UNESCO has been included, can today everyone visits.
In the first stock is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing accessible to the public.
The homeowner determined only in the years to this step and that on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator.
As you said, that this is a very profitable business activities, the surveys in, indeed we extended it to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse.
The price to visit the baudenkmals, however, is no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20% reduction.
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city.
Who the real atmosphere of the House with his drachentürmchen know would like to learn, should try, friendship with one of the inhabitants to close to home and to visit him.
The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - so rost matratze and make the good bed.
However, this must be in harmony, and with the wishes of the specific user.
The choice to play a role on many issues - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers.
It is also just as important, in which interieur matratze and subordinate rost.
Typical example?
In a wochenendhaus, in which no regular heated latexmatratzen, are not suitable for much longer, as they need to be "hot."
Moreover, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen.
And - they should be turned on a regular basis.
If you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and even on a firm plate, staut, humidity, so it is not excluded that under your schimmel.
In the election is, of course, also a role, in which it is used to.
Anyone who was long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht, will be difficult to a low matratze with hard surface can get used.
"All an ice-hockey player, which have come back from the nhl, have complained to me that you are not more right can sleep."
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hüften need it simply a weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer). '
'This, I recommend that, among other things, also zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the' information 'from the ligaments and skin can receive bad, "says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel.
That is why I have many years ago, but also other customers eishockeyspielern these matratzen with visco-schaum (memory foam) concerned.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer the manufacturers tempur, among other things, the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech manufacturers tropico."
And we must not necessarily be a famous an ice-hockey player, the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body.
Nowhere is it, in the night shifts not around as after a serious fight.
It is sleeping easy much better.
The foam viskoelastische also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene).
In the election of the matratzengröße should be to height still the length of the fußsohlen to that, is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
As Mrs Mann, the to the 180 cm are great, need as a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, together, therefore, 180 cm.
In einzelbetten of, for example, singles are 120 to 140 cm appropriate.
The own comfort, and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you on the back is, should still enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises ing. Helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter that for years the issue of healthy schlafes and good ergonomics of furniture and to put this question to colleges.
In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and his own matratze, but be careful when buying products, so that the matratzen also are high.
Otherwise, cannot do other than the roste in different level to fit and that is not in any bettrahmen possible.
At least 14 cm schaummatratzen should be high, with matratzen federskelett 15 cm, should at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster.
'with the hand or the sit down the feathers in no case, warns Helena prokopová felt ."
Any matratze makes a specific rosttyp required.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom.
These matratzen cannot be and to reveal the reference you cannot wash today, which is already there.
And since it in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years of slow to a huge (and congested sieve).
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a life span of up to 25 years ago, yes even lifelong guarantee promise.
Has any matter it.
And is therefore a practical Council by traders: in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salary, not be afraid, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, easy to use and laundering can withdraw.
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced, so one after the open up two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), the manipulation, with greater matratzen alone, above all, often carried out as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Have you in the bed rather than a rostes a firm plate?
Get out of it.
Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night.
So they should also prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight (provided that there are already not) and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm of minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use.
Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document not.
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable or latex- sandwichmatratzen (possibly also combinations of latex and kokos), always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, from 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte.
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung.
In addition to the attitude of the rigid the federleisten special flexible schultermodule will also be required.
This is a specific integration of the federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even so that the specific einsinken the back of the schläfers.
Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter.
There are even matratzenhersteller which have started, in 'herrenmatratzen "weichzonen to use for the schulterbereich.
Also to the ladies is thought - you off these weichzonen in the hüftgegend.
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which will reduce the tension.
But, if you at the right matratze and right rost a bad (to great and fülliges) kopfkissen, used the most benefits go back lost.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is supposed to be the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich, so that the schultermuskeln can ease.
Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great kissen, as for example the Scandinavians.
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze) the schulterhöhe in balance.
Some have our modern matratzen have with the former (with hay EU-US) strohsäcken but in common.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also in matratzen means the new magic word 'organic'.
Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example rizinus- and sojaöl.
Soya is used by all known manufacturers.
"organic matratzen, that is to say in their heart from materials purely of natural origin is," declared by the firm Petr vašíček tropico plus.
Naturstoffe but are also used in the production of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera.
One can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep fresh forest or lavendelduft.
Here, too, there is a difference between men and women.
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug the heat and cool can absorb the body, the salary for women 'wärmende "effect.
Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation, the weaker sex will the sleep so warm wohlig.
And today's favourites?
From kaltschaum matratzen (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than handelsübliches polyurethan and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the various stiff (rigour) by kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise, the know exactly where head, hip and closely.
For a high-quality matratze has, however, you 7 000 kroner and more to berappen.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT, as they apply as medical aid.
The first Czech enterprises has been given gumotex this advantage.
We will see, in the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy.
Now and again, there are special offers of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen for the price of one.
The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will be free to do so.
It was the material tempur, that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace.
No wonder they have been but for NASA, because the astronauts are developed in the launch huge überbelastungen.
Will tempur in heat soft, in a cool environment to entrench it in turn.
So it is the human body perfect and distributed in the best possible way the körperdruck.
It is, therefore, not only to prevent druckbrand ideal, but increased the schlafkomfort in general.
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe will not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern, used the legs and the gefäßen should provide relief.
For example, domestic producers use the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte under control, in order to have the kids
The fear for our own children is growing, and so are considering more and more parents, you by GPS to monitor.
The system that was originally to searching for cars was invented, cannot in fact people places as well, which also in such cases would be helpful, as recently in the spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year anička janatková.
The device is currently about the same size as a packet of but soon there will not be greater than a a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the disappeared anička in fear and terror and so do you, looking at ways and means to protect their children.
Also for the price of a deterioration of their privacy.
"We are trying to all to say that it is not in any way herumspionieren, but an effective means to lessen the likelihood that it leads to tragedy comes', Petr pilin macro by society because, and one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come to the abuse of such equipment, for example if there is someone in the pocket, without that he knows, but so far we have had no such case."
"The most customers buy it really is for security reasons', adds pilin.
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the 'box' is used and how they used in the event of an emergency.
The kinderpsychologin Dana bočková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing, it may not wearing his simply pace.
"also very small children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"The mobile phones initially gave birth to the parents high expectations, but they are just as easy to shut down, as this new überwachungsgeräte ', Mrs bočková.
Their opinion is also controversial, whether such a body in the event of an attack actually helps.
"In planned kidnappings controlled the kidnappers virtually always, whether the child has any electronics in itself, with which there could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such überwachungsgeräte broader use publicized, would you, as these also seek their sale sure would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"in these cases the criminals are one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
It acknowledges that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophiles can be extremely helpful.
Roberta čech of the society RC monitoring, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen both for passenger cars, as well as for people, of the existence of such a appliance can also help if it then, immediately after the attack will be destroyed.
"The machine, so that the respective position in certain intervals."
"even if it immediately to be destroyed, at least, is the final position of the person involved available."
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, that is to say, if you are hinfällt and bewegungslos remains, sends out the equipment immediately a warning, indicating the position," claims Mr čech.
In his opinion, could similar services also intelligent mobile phones with navigation, we need only a specific software einzuspielen.
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either in order to appliances in streichholzschachtel-größe, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that it loses.
Mr pilin from the macro because, according to it, therefore, in the present testing equipment as normal digitaluhren look like.
"It has the advantage that the possible attackers not at all needs to recognise that it is a monitoring or localisation device which makes it possible.
"or he can see the only after a certain time, what the police are a zeitvorsprung ', adds it.
No matter which way the development - towards armbändern or supporters, always will be the same technology, as in the case of fahrzeugortung.
Therefore, the combination of ortungsfunktion with the help of the gps-systems (just as the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which the current position.
The army has so many zündschnüre that we could keep the Czech Republic umwickeln but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre bought with explosives, be released.
In the year before, the Defense Ministry already 224 kilometres to the armeelager powder.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years have ausgesorgt.
The problem is only the shelf-life of zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army of the company bought the zündschnüre stv group, other things S. for a mere 40 million kroner.
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder replied the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would in a year, the 60 kilometres powder use.
According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern, the mf dnes point that came from this claim is that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnic training should - of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, to the secretaries and Putzfrauen.
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general picek vlastimil not excluded.
Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length is also actually 25,000 detonationen.
But even so, would these armeebestände for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that for the training of each new professional two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by these neueinkäufe - even from the point of view of the increased needs of the key and special units - a reassuring supply for the above-mentioned 225 years.
It complained soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently in the Defense Minister Vondra, you would have almost no patronen for small arms register more so that, because of the lack of resources are severely restricted.
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel.
'me is also not why they buy such huge amounts of us zündschnüre. "
But that is, ultimately, its decision, you will already be aware, to what you need '.
"for us is the army a good customer, which we, as traders to want to come as far as possible ', says the vertriebsmanager the stv group Jan děcký.
Jan pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army that would have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him.
Jan děcký of the stv group but talks only of a four-year gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even only of two years ago.
'With perfect storage are probably also the four mentioned years possible', one of them a, but wants to remain turns, not as a soldier accused the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer any munitions must be thoroughly tested, whether they are reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk.
These tests are but not for nothing, but cost money.
A further argument, Department of Defense is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres powder.
"They cost us 60% less than the letztjährige supply of 244 kilometres," spokesman pejšek shares the view of the US Department of Defense einkäufer with.
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet bruderarmee withdraw, exceeds some years already barely 1 500 metres.
And the police state, not always only such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume.
The security of the pyrotechniker, furthermore, because they are so the possibility of flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable zündschnüre open.
In any case, the Defense Ministry has huge problems in the winding-up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak people " s army continuously on their campaign on the Rhine prepared.
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes has raised, expected the Czech forces in a few years, the same problem in the winding up of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre you today as "good" has bought.
Up to now I have want the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The victorious ranking in competition 'small entrepreneurs of the year' lukáš pytloun have in the sale of the discount of his hotels helped.
The winner of the last jahrganges of competition 'small entrepreneurs of the year' has been carried out by Liberec lukáš from pytloun.
The history of his success sounds like a filmszenarium.
Lukáš pytloun went like.
Only abroad, he was aware that it in carried out by Liberec to good übernachtungsmöglichkeiten at reasonable prices, is missing.
From the savings of his ferienarbeiten abroad, and by means of a century ago he bankkredits a baufälliges House with five homes.
Bearing in mind that he hochschulstudent in the sixth term was at the time, this was certainly a daunting.
'The Former preis-qualität-verhältnis angered me and so I tried to do something about it, "says lukáš pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte housing rented it to auslandsarbeiter.
The whole profit he immediately invested back into the House, which he then step by step to pension with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then it managed in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in carried out by Liberec four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels, with a total of over 300 beds of all unterkunftskategorien to open up.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the viersternehotel "pytloun design hotel."
In this year, a further first-class hotel.
"We have just a Treaty with a hotel in ostrov U tisé signed, which we have sold franchise-konzept and other interested parties on discount the pytloun-hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneurs number one of last year.
"large share of this lizenzverkauf at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition 'entrepreneurs of the year', adds Mr pytloun admiration.

You also need not equal to gain any visible is good.
He says that he until today from the contacts and acquaintances benefits, to which it would otherwise not at all.
'with some people that I have met thanks to the competition, I still hold regular business relations. "
The associated with the success of glory is, in his opinion, also a little in any of its staff.
And as he has to the seventy.
"I notice in them greater loyalty and proud that they are part of something, the general recognition."
I see this really is not just as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is just something to the fore," says lukáš pytloun modest.
My successors, I wish a ruhigeres year than we had in farmet
The euphoria of victory for was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition has the worst farmet.
The price for the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year in the last year, Karel žďárský, the company owners of farmet.
At that time the jury paid tribute to the efforts which it from the small werkzeugbau in Česká skalice a company from the ground improvised parliamentary, the hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this not only myself but also encouraged all my staff and our self-confidence in the fight with the competition has encouraged ', says the vorjahresgewinner.
At the beginning of the corporate life was of farmet state the effort to try to do something useful.
And when the state his father Karel žďárský as compensation for the of the Communists confiscated property a small repair shop to lease offered not hesitated for a long time, he left his career in the company, in which he was working until then sausen and founded with a few comrades his father, a separate company for the production of plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on pflanzenölpressen.
Within 18 years, they are the largest producer of automatic restricted in the whole of Central Europe.
But only by the success in the competition and whose medialisierung it is also aware of the nicht-fachöffentlichkeit happened.
'not only that our customers the brand farmet now much more intense, our foreign partners also began the fact, able to work with a firm in your country, the greatest possible success is achieved, to attach greater value, "says Karel žďárský.
The past year has been at farmet, however, not only in the sign of the euphoria of victory for.
Was the appreciation of the economic results of the company in the years 2008 and of a part of 2009.
And it is precisely in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of werkzeugbauprodukten.
The crisis, at the time, still less for the citizens, but above all companies, schüttelte just reached its peak, many companies have been forced to stop their investment projects and the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
'this situation we could, of course, is also not escape. "
"The sales went by 40%, we have had to limit production, and even to resort to redundancies," says Karel žďárský
A viable companies must also sometimes such unpopular measures.
It was, however, the situation in the control and the company in the black figures, even if with lower than before the crisis.
In a was not willing to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
'from the buildings we grant a research and schulungszentrum, we bestärkten our presentation on international measure and studying hauptpreise domestic exhibitions, "says žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales grow again and with you, the number of new staff.
"The new winner, I wish much pleasure in the victory - but in ruhigerer atmosphere," does Karel žďárský.
An opinion poll, removing the with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll in view of the absurdity of the year 'is the fourth time part of the unternehmerwettbewerbs.
Some nonsensical regulations already succeeded, from the world.
The dubious winners of the next generation strive to attain the opinion poll "absurdity of the year 'in the duty, documents on authorities to create available online.
So more than a third of not quite of four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the sozialversicherungsverwaltung demanded a papierauszug from the handelsregister, even if it would have the officials by two mausklicks access.
Thanks to the opinion poll is changing this now.
"The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung will in future when controls of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the handelsregister asking more ', led the speaker from čssz Jana buraňová.
The purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year," it is, all the rules and orders to scrutinise the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, have to meet and the unreasonable.
This is in this year for the fourth time part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs by the tsch. Business newspaper (hn) will be hosted and in public growing popularity.
If in the last year of the three thousand people in the vote, it was involved in this year of four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, the only serves, entrepreneurial activity.
"What, for example, the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned, we take a front rank in the world ', says Mr Karel havlíček from the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and gewerbetreibender of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business activity is in the last few years the proclaimed aim of all the governments.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, however, hardly improved.
According to the World Bank is the Czech Republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the 74. Rank, compared to the previous year, eight seats a worse place.
The competition of the absurdity of the year for the first time in years, has been declared and plays every year for equal scenario.
Everyone can of April by the redaktionsschluss of competition at the end of September administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To the notification serves the website address www.firmaroku.cz. beyond the organisers of competition seven candidates for the "antipreis' and the public on the Internet sites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It will triumph that absurdity, the most votes.
To this year's opinion poll have already been more than one hundred, 105 senseless rules and orders.
The clues come not only of entrepreneurs, but also of professional organisations and journalists.
Under the nominated "finalisten" of competition, for example provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge for motorways and express roads toll or that entrepreneurs have to pay with twenty members of staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published in the pages of competition.
The proclamation of competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happenings in which regularly also figures of the political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva svobodová, the director of the Association of small or medium-sized businesses and gewerbetreibender the tsch. Republic and Petr kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce the tsch. Republic at the height of the competition involved.
'where the state the entrepreneurs spanner into the, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my aim, every year at least thirty paragraphs that today the entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their actions', informed Martin kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade with.
The efforts, nonsensical orders, show effect.
In 2007 the people most troubled the entrepreneurs have imposed on duty, the gewerbeamt at the place of their permanent company three days in advance of the intention to declare, with a ausstellungsstand to an exhibition or kirmes to want to travel.
This obligation has been force a series of gewerbegesetzes lifted.
The duty, the 2007 the second largest number of the vote - the duty, the job travel by workers in the scope of up to 30 days - was to declare it by the law on the so-called 'green card' abolished.
And - of all good things are three:
The absurdity of the year 2009 has been elected to the regulation, the it physiotherapeuten sprechzimmer imposed, in a mirror, a refrigerator and two personenwaagen.
This regulation was by the Ministry of Health in this year mitigated to some extent - the kühlschrankpflicht fell way.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sports projects
A novelty in this year's already fifth vintage of competition of the business newspaper (hn) is the category 'responsible company of the year 2010'.
Basic idea of this competition is reasonable and fair undertakings.
'We would like to support such firms, which the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment are aware and socially responsible support initiatives, "says Patrik bartholdy, the regionalmanager of mobilfunkunternehmens vodafon, the ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, just and competition" rebel of the year'.
This year's first vintage this particular underclass of the hauptwettbewerbs vodafon company of the year from firms, for which the success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough substance for a self-employed rule.
Even though they are in relation to the subject of their activities diametrically opposed to distinguish their efforts, however, have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, gehandicapte people, as a personal problems or the health of their own staff.
Among the fourteen finalisten from across the Czech Republic appeared for example the Prague software companies et netera to the emergence of not formal sportteams among their staff, the then in many tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region is society pardubice isolit-bravo 17 years already, the main sponsor of a stiftungsfonds for gehandicapte children.
A paper mill from poděbrady is exemplary for their health disabled employees, the 70% of its workforce, for which you with the title 'responsible company mittelböhmen "have recognized the region; in the competition Vodafone company of the year, in the context of this region in the third place.
In the region olomouc won the buchhaltungsfirma miryz soft, amongst other things, a fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week introduced reduced working hours without cutting wages, and this mistrust.
The jury honorierte in titelverleihung also the fact that the company predominantly in Czech manufacturers buy, citizens' initiatives in their area supported and demand for environmentally friendly principles is working.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible, to the consequences of our business activity and the administration for the environment as light as possible," declared their geschäftsführerin miluše ryznarová.
The responsible it companies enlogit ústí nad Labem from the region, in turn, is the health of its workers and that is why it has to you all notebooks ergonomische chair and tastaturen equipment, also promotes them in their employees work at home and in firmenaktionen cartering-dienstleistungen you used by a domestic protected workshop.
"We also support the foundation 'people in need' which the local roma-kommunität concrete assistance," says Ondřej suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, is also the activity of the reinigungsfirma "praní a čištění 'from the Karlsbad region worth noting, the their workers in the form of extra-bonussen contributes to their pensions.
"We give our workers contributions to the food, for the distances, to increase their qualifications and for the holidays," says Josef strapáč from the construction company from czasch bruntál, the winner in the mährisch-schlesischen region.
On category responsible company of the year were automatically all bezirksfinalisten of competition vodafon company of the year, the issues of the moment of registration enclosed questionnaire beantwortetet and him at the latest by the 15.august the organisers zuschickten.
Wrong or incomplete please answers to the questionnaire by the organisers were excluded from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the wetteifernden firms the unanswered questions, they were from the competition 'responsible company of the year', in the hauptwettbewerb Vodafone company of the year, therefore, but they were not disqualifying."
'a separate notification only to this competition is not possible because it just an underclass of the hauptwettbewerbs company of the year is, "says Karel Goldman of of the organising agency bison & rose.
Pilsner bodenfonds - arrests of the police in a public invitation to tender
In the buildings of bodenfonds in Pilsen adopted in the last few days the antikorruptionspolizei arrests.
It was the European medien-unternehmer and immobilienhändler luboš G. of the detektiven defrayed in handcuffs.
This was supposedly a just held public competition for the phasing-out of restitutionsansprüchen manipulate, that the competition zufielen plots of land offered a specific interested parties.
This should luboš G. for half a million paid.
'at this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the crime of fraudulent activity in a public competition persecuted, "said antonie zelená, the head of the pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper' právo ', it could further details in relation to the current investigations not.
24 hours later, the 46-jährige entrepreneurs released by the police.
In what way he was able to manipulate the public competition, that can be given the meagre official information only speculate.
The speaker of the bodenfonds lubomír černá led to the question of právo in that the police have in the pilsner antenna of bodenfonds indeed arrests and this made during a public competition.
"It was a clients and certainly not by one of our staff," given sharper contours you.
The public competition, according to Mrs černá had the correct name 'call for tender of entitlements to transfer of land in accordance with the bodengesetz "and would take place in cases in which several applicants interest in the land offered bezeigen.
"offer these people in the framework of the call a higher value of their by the transfer to begleichenden restitutionsansprüche when the proclaimed grundstückswert."
'in accordance with the claims will be the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the bodenfonds the land on the person with the highest supply, "says the Speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. were obviously information available, anyone who is on the request, and since he himself had registered legitimate person was, as it does, a number of restitutionsansprüchen had bought he offered a grundstücksinteressen that he will withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fats compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why it in his arrest such a large amount of money in itself was.
Luboš G. had already, in the past too good contacts with the pilsner bodenfonds.
So he played in the issue of the former head of the bodenfonds Václav sankota a role, has been prosecuted because, in return, the ersatzrestitutionen plots of land, which already standortentscheidungen had been taken to construction projects.
At that time, for example by the aforementioned luboš bodenfonds also land to build public roads were designed, more precisely, to the point at which the construction of the zufahrtsmagistrale borské a Pole, the industrial area was planned.
Later he even changing this very favourable with the government against a House directly in the historic centre of the city, the value of the land far exceeded.
The city hall had to kleinbeigeben at that time with a heavy heart, not the construction projects by the deadlock of the land.
The housing of households are increasing at a few hundred per month
The budgets from January must not only with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with more water and abwassergebühren and for district heating and in some places the rent grow.
Families are as from January several hundred kroner per month must learn more from the wallets than it has been so far.
Electricity by 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2% and more in many cities will be up to a tenth more for wasserlieferungen figures must also become more expensive and in some places the fernwärmelieferungen.
Only the stromteuerung costs the wohnungshaushalte a few hundred kronor per year.
The starkstrompreise have been reduced by all the main suppliers, blame is the clear electricity from renewable sources, especially from fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas will only moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when the people most heat and must have the highest consumption.
Here, too, is, therefore, with a few hundred kronor per annum.
While electricity and gas across the Czech Republic be more expensive, are the prices for district heating from city to city of different.
Above all, greater places plan price increases.
It must, for example, households in pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating up to 50 Crowns per month to pay more, more than 1 000 families pay kronor per year in carried out by Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatening to 9% higher water and abwassergebühren and this is the case that the city of the infrastrukturmiete increased.
If the rent does not change, and there are only 6.8%.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole of the Czech Republic, however, to continue to be the lowest.
In northern Bohemia, where the prices are already among the highest, water and abwassergebühren in order to 7.4% increase.
Enormous mietpreiserhöhungen, for example, in 140, 000 rental housing to be expected, as from January the so-called mietregulierung disappearing.
For example, the plans to housing associations CPI byty nad Labem in ústí 2 500 homes, the rent from January equally of 100%.
Anyone who does not agree with this mieterhöhung, the courts, the companies' issues.
The regulated rent, the one today in approximately 300 000 homes, should pay next year by more than 10% increase.
Czech children with Fernet highest and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, just for once, also time a good whisky, which the father has stolen from the hausbar.
These are the beverages, for whose benefit from drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently notbehandelt.
No exception are children, the their hangovers ausschlafen must repeatedly in the hospital.
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics.
'beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get. "
"Today's trend is clearly of hard alcohol," said právo luděk Pelikán, the chefarzt the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice.
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of hausbar to ours and, if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
'vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then it smacks of not as strong, "says the chefarzt.
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right.
"the most, it is about Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alkoholtrend, especially at primary school."
"occasionally it was also about slibowitz, we feel at home ', led Mrs jurinová.
According to Pelikán chefarzt dreizehn- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme long fairly common.
Before the clinic in hořovice, on which he is working, since this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie-abteilung motol the hospital, where the ambulances angetrunkene ablieferten pupils from far and wide.
'A girl had to be four times hospitalisiert. "
"You began their careers with 12 years ago, when the first time it with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" extase "was," described the doctor was a particularly serious case.
"It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty."
"The interesting in that it was not at all strange, taking their mother, that your daughter 48 hours not came home ', is the chefarzt.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance at the start with the own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A real dependence in the true sense of the word, is it not, according to experts, in children.
"under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case in these children."
With those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is often a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic, "says chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital motol, according to Mrs jurinová were until the middle of November around forty drunken children in the abandonment of department for child and jugendmedizin trained.
However, only the cases with serious alkoholvergiftung, the one in hospital was needed, go in the statistics.
Drunken children, the following ambulatory care of the parents of the police or, if necessary, be brought home, are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only times as a bottle of spirits in the schulbank austrinken are there in the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, to the 100% is good: walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve of and the end of the school year.
"the latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor testimony to or from joy on the holiday."
'in the walpurgisnacht I have already seven drunken children at once experienced in the opening, "stresses Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes child that the night under medical supervision spends, paradoxically, is better off, as a child, the next day, only with a nasty hangover.
The headaches on the morning after that, the of the dehydration and the glukosemangel, can be in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose produced and nutrients, the absence of the organism.
"clearly they are better off, because according to the" beautiful 'experience in the evening, raise it with good humour, without that somewhere something ache. "
"You are only a little confused as to where they are ', Dr Pelikán, recognising the patients sometimes at least the good humour in similar vein, by giving you the cost of that year, you who treatment will cost.
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in a akutbett well and like to come to a few tens of thousands of kronor.
"now and again I have used this as erziehungsmittel, if I directly to the children in the visit have meant, which has cost their Drunkenness and that it can happen that you time the whole holidays on must work to make the money for a single such fete to earn," added Dr Pelikán.
In his view, the health insurance funds, however, not after regressverfahren, in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
Two trainingsflugzeuge l-159, for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two slight fighter planes l-159 of a total of five, the Czech Ministry of defence against the transport aircraft Casa c-295m are exchanged on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturers Casa - EADS take up residence.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were so far only in manoeuvres or flugshows to see.
It concerns the flugfähige zweisitzerversion l-159t1 by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige l-159.
These are currently still in einkonserviert aero vodochody, of mediators this business - the firm omnipol - it has adopted last week.
When the aircraft physically from vodochody expediert, is Jan pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman, not yet known.
The einsitzigen l-159 fighter aircraft have been stored in the long term, in turn, from being singled out, and this without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen l-159t1 were in current state and be exchanged," said pejšek právo the newspaper.
He added that the army will not manage without zweisitzige fighter planes, as must the defence ministry in May 2009 with aero vodochody a 200-millionen-vertrag on the reorganization of four unnecessary l-159 zweisitzigen version signed up to.
A new aircraft, the army in July, the second, which it intends to adopt by the end of this year.
According to the EADS pejšek has undertaken the fighter planes in the equipment one of the NATO countries.
"in the Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS buyer of the aircraft l-159 and that this is the training of pilots, the NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter for the abnehmers, in what way he realised the matter ', led to pejšek.
The business newspaper (hn) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the l-159.
Barter payments of five l-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor, over the last year or the government of Mr Mirek Topolánek been approved.
The Defense Ministry had had to buy a tender procedures put out to tender, but spoke EADS directly.
The former verteidigungsamt argued that this exchange will the future export the l-159 support abroad.
The Czech army bought aero 72 machinery, of which you only 24 used, the rest, it wanted to sell.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa should, in fact, still a legal process.
The European Commission verklagte the Czech Ministry that is, of the European Court of Justice. The reason? there would have been the aircraft due to a ganzeuropäischen tender and not to have to choose by a single producer.
The army has already three aircraft Casa, the last should within fourteen days at the airport kbely land.
A long finger than ringfinger means lower risk to developing cancer
Men, the finger is long, as the ringfinger, are obviously a lower risk, to prostate cancer to become ill.
This is a surprising result of a study that on the Wednesday of the British journal of cancer has been published.
This is the mirror of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for prostate cancer can serve the risk and this particular at men to sixty ', said the mitautorin the study on krebsforschungsinstitut Ros eeles, a professor at the university in WARWICK.
The finger could help to determine which men is necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are available, such as, for example, family health problems, added Mrs eeles.
In the period from 1994-2009 pursued it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, the 3 000 healthy men.
In more than half of all the participants of the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men, whose 'ring' and finger equal long.
In men, their finger longer than the ringfinger was, however, this risk fell by 33%, in men to sixty even 87%.
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned finger, which is already in the prenatal age are obviously reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen, which the child in the womb was exposed.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer fingers.
Former research found that it is precisely the testosterone growth accelerated prostate cancer.
Václav pačes, leading Czech geneticists and a former chairman of the Academy of Sciences čtk, said that he was aware of this study fleetingly, he think, nevertheless, that the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer have not so far proved to be totally 'for'.
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 - are blocked
In the same way as the of the largest part of Europe is also the Czech Republic under a white on Thursday morning.
On the roads and gehwegen is mostly frozen snow, the winterdienstler were in many places on axis.
The motorway D5 - between kilometres 89 and 90 towards rozvadov is of some accidents of lorries and cars because blocked and also the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague 'is'.
This was said the novinky.cz dispatcher of the Central auto-moto-klubs (úamk).
In kilometres 91 since a lorry in kilometres 93 breathed two lorries together, this accident is there have been injured.
A few cars are in the gutter.
There are also problems kilometres 185 of the motorway D1 towards Prague.
Here are two lorries zusammengestoßen.
Drivers should just behind Brno in kilometres 190 leave or about Brno drive and in kilometres of 182 in place kývalka steel.
There are, in fact, kilometres of traffic jams.
Also on the d11 is an accident and the immediately at the zufahrt to Prague.
In Prague is a several centimetre thick white and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, in the form autokolonnen stadteil prosek, also the road štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport, there is in any case the underground.
The trams drive with delays, for example on the line between karlsplatz and friedensplatz.
Eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague cell together.
Also on the railways and the airport, there are problems.
The Czech state-run rail company had to because schneeverwehungen seven schnellzugverbindungen deleted.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - kralupy or Prague - beroun.
The passengers should necessarily be informed about the current situation.
The airport is ruzyně since Wednesday 11 p.m. at night to 5 o'clock in the morning closed.
The majority of roads in südmähren are only with greater caution line.
In order to completely unbefahrbar vyškov are three country roads, in the vicinity of Brno form in places schneeverwehungen and in the vicinity of blansko, one is forced, on some high streets schneefräsen.
One of the most affected areas is výškov.
There are three roads still completely blocked: rousínov - slavkov, bohdalice - kučerov and also šaratice - milešovice.
Here, too, we will have to use to schneeräumung schneefräsen.
When you again, this is not assess until now.
In the region hodonín is in the area of weißkarpaten caution.
On the roads, the from naturschutzgründen only with inerten streumitteln must be achieved, is a up to five centimetres thick White, led to čtk.
In the Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimetres neuschnee, most in Northern Bohemia - in places to 18 centimetres.
In the mährisch-schlesischen region fell by up to 15 centimeters neuschnee.
In the Czech Republic but this slow to schneien.
American soldiers have a new 'intelligent weapon. "
The American troops in Afghanistan have, for the first time, a new 'intelligent' weapon, which previously only under your codebezeichnung xm-25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon the conflict with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favour.
The new weapon is something, as a supergenaue.
Indeed, their projektile by lasers with an accuracy of just a few metres objective.
The specific shells of standard 25 mm, which were developed for this machine gun and dangerous explosive, functioning practically as small grenades.
The shells could be programmed that they not only on impact on the target, but on any point of your ballistic flugbahn can explode.
That means that you cannot use it against an enemy behind an obstacle - a wall or the schützengraben.
It is from the top is usually not protected from above, the murderous stahlsplitterregen can therefore easily battle it out.
Richard audett according to the development of the xm-25 stakeholders, is the new kampfgewehr the first infanteriewaffe 'intelligent' technologies to harness.
"The soldier is basically as before: he seeking the objective and sends out a laser beam from, the distance, so it will gain a precise visierpunkt, after which he erhöhungswinkel corrected, then he only needs abzudrücken.
"say, it has 543 m measured."
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting the geschoss on the distance 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be shifted
The company Fujitsu shifted its establishment in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year will be their jobs 400 employees from the previous office buildings on marienbader place in bad homburg in the astro park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifted its establishment in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
As the on computers and their maintenance specialist branchenriese on Wednesday stated, in July of next year will be 400 women and men to work from the previous office buildings on marienbader place in bad homburg in the astro park, that is a great bürokomplex in Lyons street in the Frankfurter district of niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu has explained, in the medium term there should still further 100 jobs have to be accommodated, which has been so far in the region are distributed.
The mietangebot is very attractive, moreover, would have been the großraumbüros in astro Park of the functioning of the staff better.
Also in bad homburg was Fujitsu just tenants.
The responsible managers Bernd Wagner said, "with frankfurt-niederrad we have a central location with excellent infrastructure 'found.
The excellent links with the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu of great importance.
The new to move a major company within the region called yesterday pleasure in frustration among the winners and the losers.
The Frankfurt wirtschaftsdezernent Markus frank (CDU) said, it is once again a 'global player' has been won.
This was a "great standortbekenntnis."
Fujitsu passe to city, the location is an important boost for niederrad.
The bad homburger Lord Mayor Michael korwisi (the Greens) has expressed its deep concern at the decision of Fujitsu.
The city is early the management has been informed about the intention.
"We have, of course, the companies offering our help," said korwisi.
The friendly contacts would, however, have nothing to the difficulties of the computerherstellers with the landlords will of the property on marienbader place can change.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have made all the difference.
Now is concerned, a long risk in such a prominent place to prevent.
"I hope the owners and landlords will of the building is cooperative."
The Fujitsu House on rathausplatz used so far and the neighbouring 'small vertical "were with the rest of the buildings on marienbader place ten years ago to the most controversial projects of the kurstadt.
As a common project of the city and of a private projektentwicklers arose between station and a new stadtentree City Hall, both because of the massive development of previously part as a car park land and the level of buildings for criticism.
2001 the anlageberatungs- and ratingunternehmen feri referred, the software-hersteller for reisevertriebssysteme, start Amadeus, and the associated with Siemens computer manufacturers Fujitsu the houses.
The Fujitsu buildings used, in 2006, of the Frankfurter German immobilien-chancen-gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish falcon real estate investments SA in Madrid sold.
The in Tokyo beheimatete fujitsu-konuzern are called the third largest it-provider the world.
It is companies, for example, computers and server prepared and also makes the necessary service.
The establishment in the rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, far more people Fujitsu, however, in Munich.
From bad homburg prefers the subsidiary Fujitsu technology solutions in frankfurt-niederrad a, the further subsidiaries at that location should Fujitsu services and a company called TDs.
For that, in the office buildings astro park 7 000 square metre sublet.
In the 20 years old complex - the name plays in his sternförmigen footprint - has, among other things, the zentralverband elektrotechnik- and electronics industries his seat.
Amazon freezes servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The internet-dienstleister Amazon has the enthüllungsplattform of his servers exiled.
There is perhaps political pressure for the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomaten-depeschen.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposedly in England.
The enthüllungsplattform WikiLeaks equipment in the United States increasingly under attack.
The internet-aktivisten lost access to its previous American server and are now seeking a internet-heimat in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe, Avigdor Lieberman, called, however, other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the fahndungslisten by Interpol, should stop after a press report in the United Kingdom.
"WikiLeaks of amazon-server."
'free speech in the land of the free, "shared the enthüllungs-aktivisten by kurznachrichtendienst Twitter on Wednesday (local time) with.
Shortly before the dot.com companies had the Amazon wikileaks-dokumente of his servers exiled.
The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen on the Amazon web service (AWS), the high zugriffszahlen on the documents.
By Twitter WikiLeaks declared to the step further: 'fine - our dollar will now be spent on people in Europe. "
If Amazon such problem with the speech, "should stop to sell books'.
The use of its server Amazon have stopped by WikiLeaks after staff of Senator Joe, Avigdor Lieberman, investigations, the television station CNN reported in reference to the office liebermans.
The chairman of the Amazon senatsausschusses of homeland security was threatened with a boycott, told the British 'Guardian'.
"I would have liked Amazon sooner is taking this measure in view of the previous publications klassifizierter information by WikiLeaks', said the senator.
Meanwhile, Avigdor Lieberman, called for the platform in other countries to deny the use for servers.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and ruthless approach, our national security at risk and threat around the globe life ', it means in a communication of the other independents senator.
"not a responsible companies - whether American or foreign--matter WikiLeaks in his efforts - should help to spread stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, because vergewaltigungsverdachts sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the fahndungsliste of Interpol.
According to a report of the London newspaper 'the independent "is the 39-year-old Australians in Great Britain, the exact location is Scotland Yard known.
The internet-aktivist the investigations in Sweden has always described as a set-up of its opponents.
Wikileaks-sprecher kristinn hrafnsson said in London, there have been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange rightly fear its security, said hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Obviously hrafnsson responded on statements from North America.
In America, the previous Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the wikileaks-enthüllungen indicted for treason and should be executed.
In Canada said a consultant of head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange 'should be killed "and" Obama could use a drone. "
Between the White House and Assange today in the meantime, a battle.
The speaker of the US president, Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if you had asked for recently estimated spionage-aufforderungen to diplomats is responsible.
'I am not quite sure why we are about the opinion of a types with a website, "Gibbs care.
"our foreign policy and the interests of that country are far more important than its a website."
The American Government is now the protection of their databases fully to the test.
As the special envoy is the vize-direktor of the Centre for measures to combat terrorism, Russell Travers, has been appointed, informed the White House with.
Travers is responsible for this, "the necessary structural reforms' develop, the following the publication of the botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks necessary.
The White House will also want to check the way, as the entire government information and protection.
Moreover, the American Government announced, for the safety of dissidents and most active, to by the wikileaks-veröffentlichung, they should be in jeopardy.
"We have done everything to contact with them," said außenamtssprecher Philip Crowley.
'We stand ready to protect them, if that should be necessary'.
The eis-universität
In the 'gelato university' in Bologna eiskonditoren seasons, be better prepared.
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest gain and visitors from around the world.
What is actually the whole ice?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, a little old-fashioned the eiskonditor in German, is the cream after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst.
The gelataio is catching up with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, it abolishes in the waffel and selling them then.
In order to know, we must not after anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the 'gelato-university' the Italian firm carpigiani over.
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen set up in the year 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest gain and visitors from around the world.
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele.
Some in the midlife-crisis is dreaming of a new career, other venture simply time on the treacherous ice their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries, from all continents - of Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
, Jacky kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and will in future in the country of the industrial ice-cream a European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little own eintüten.
Two young ägypterinnen dream in Cairo to open a eisdiele.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil, the quality of the ice cream in their bars improve - and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because their children Italian ice cream love.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the first participants, the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
What is crucial is not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets in its training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät, with an electronic programme everything to 85 degree inflamed passions and then immediately to four degrees are cooling.
Then he is of the machine a tap on, and out is a pasteurisierte White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten.
Will the lecturer immediately with questions bestürmt ice cream: we can only with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can we allow the own experimentierlust free?
Luciano warns that spirit to be fooled.
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients' speech, has probably still stabilisers used - usually a natural product, for example from the guarbohne guarkernmehl.
We cannot, of course, also without ice stabiliser, only it must then be sold within one day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer to bite eiskörnchen louder.
Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavourings.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano between the different ingredients, which you obst-abteilung or in the sweets of the supermarket are buying.
Moreover, there are powder and pasten.
"The suppliers are all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions."
"But you should simply time to experiment."
Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse, the with eggs to yellow flower will and with kakaopulver on the basis for all possible schokoladen-verführungen.
Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen.
Luciano leaves they each four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; it will not necessarily be better.
Not necessarily nussiger haselnuss-eis tastes, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi-eis, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe: will pfirsich-püree with much sugar used in the sugar grundrezept, must be reduced.
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar necessary.
Luciano prefers a device, with which he the sugar content of the determined fruchtsorten (wine growers measure so that the oechsle in grape musts).
Fortunately, facilitate the rechnerei tables.
To make ice requires not more so much physical use as before.
Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture the grundmasse helps.
There is also a device, which at the same time the ready-made eis-mischung cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen kept cool.
Despite all the computerized remain small breakdowns.
The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its kurskollegen from top to bottom, with fruchtpüree than him the überdimensionale hand blenders spiral out of control.
"in each course," says Maestro Luciano, 'it is only a matter of time before that happens. "
Inspectors in zwielicht
The European Food Authority is of the EFSA with crops experimental industry.
This accusation testbiotech now formulated the group of experts, which, as an independent institute for the impact assessment of the biotechnology understands.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte were for years in the lobbyistenverband ilsi under the Treaty.
The will of groups of companies such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper have significantly contributed to the efsa-prüfvorschriften for crops and hence in a clear conflict of interests, criticised then.
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise word for word with position papers of the ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, the fact of the authority is to be controlled in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that a testbiotech interessenskollision share your criticism.
It should be a high-level efsa-managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have so that the sides.
Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) had recently human links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby, reveals what the umweltbundesamt, as EU parliamentarians sit up and take notice.
The EFSA can, however, see no conflict of interest.
We would reiterate to all serious data, even on those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it says in an opinion.
Of the experts, who work for EFSA, you do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
They would need to disclose this, however.
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States.
This calls itself neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy, among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag.
In the matter of independent experts criticise how then that genetically modified plants currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals be allowed and the reaction of crops to nurture, will not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, of genetically modified maize on the field power," says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test how liefere no reliable results.
"If the risks not addiction, how can we then find it? 'asks then and point an accusing finger.
It also provides for Angelika hilbeck so.
The scientist parts since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the technical university Zurich.
The industry attempts in this area, as in the United States now also in Europe is becoming more and more, critical scientists to influence and to discredit.
There is therefore hardly researchers, not with groups are intertwined.
For businesses critical studies would not usually published.
"The industry controls the security research," claims hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli gsell has also what concerned, a total of around 400 kg.
On Monday evening, he was have Stuttgart station, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed heavily.
The history is well known: in September were the excavators angerückt and had started a major piece of the nordflügels break off.
The Stuttgart world was not more of the same: thousands marched against s21 billions, the station's tieferlegung.
When it came to the settlement freeze, there was a large proportion of the wing in ruins.
Broke off in 6 000 to 7 000 pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, between 1914 and in 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has a few of the areas of guaranteed.
'these obstacles are reliquien. "
"You must not disappear."
He schwärmt: "a cheaper and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft."
As he a aufsägte, have the following zigarettenqualm gerochen.
What he will do with the scraps he knows he is not yet.
Obstacles have time.
Uli gsell also.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads in a forest in Tübingen on a former munitionsdepot the French army to be where Manuel rongen stein-reich has built.
The 44-jährige acts with old stones.
He has all the bought on the demolition in Stuttgart fell.
'It would be a shame, you would schotter gemahlen or in the landfill disappearance, "he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, once a wachhäuschen was.
We have named and threatened him, he tells in September in the newspapers that he was the remnants of the nordflügels from abbruchunternehmer bought.
But he has talked with the s-21-gegnern days.
And he has told them that it but now nothing for the demolition.
And if it was happening, then it is but the most sensible, if the stones were used.
Around 200 s-21-gegner then took a of, on average, 80 kilos of serious quader with, stückpreis 6,50 by EUR 14.
As a memory, some but also in the hope, him on a reconstruction able to return.
500 tonnes rongen had bought, 25 great lkw-ladungen.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landschaftsgärtner, häuslebauer.
Everywhere you and would have been weggeschleppt what boot and supporters were able to bear.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long in "or" mäuerle in limits of kräuterbeeten.
This stone 'actually is nothing special, "says rongen.
'would not be the political component. "
It is rising in his SUVs, makes a tour by 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura, he has studied and broken off later biology, then he has, in computer interested and is, after all, steinhändler.
And steinliebhaber.
He is 40000 tonnes of stones.
From the whole of Germany karrt he its value.
He says that he is of the greatest altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He is slowing down.
In the snow are skilful behauene sandsteine.
"They were even to Dresden marienbrücke," he told.
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt.
"My lieblingsstein."
It is the way high by the forest.
It shows on a bunch of: red sandstein, formerly part of the Karlsruhe little station.
And further.
'Fine travertin. "
Once the quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from the Stuttgart, bringing rötlicher stone is complemented with from the Cathedral of St blasien, tuff Heilbronner hospital.
What work that effort, which sweat.
If rongen to think about how the stones used by hand being and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren have been moved, he will quite reverential.
'It would be a scandal if something like that would schreddern. "
Is it not become rich, immensely rich.
But today the steinhändler 14 people employed, also, the top in the forest steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer resident.
'We are working hard, but it is satisfactory,' says the resteverwerter.
He must soon after Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
Talentekampf at high-potentials
There is flourishing run on Buffett.
16 students are in order, lachsbrötchen tomatensuppe and trick.
The Technical University braunschweig and of car Volkswagen have the maschinenbau- and designstudenten invited to a workshop.
In a kind of ideenwettbewerb should they, together with vw-entwicklern on the car of the future fachsimpeln - and in passing, Volkswagen.
In the competition for the best brains are now many companies in the nahkampf and how VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hörsälen to recruit, before you on the labour market and of other pulled.
And, because the universities no identification of the achievements of their students, attempts to present the ausnahmetalente in praxisprojekten to erspähen and in itself.
On the second day of the workshops on the Tu braunschweig, the autokonzern at the talents.
A young lady from the human resources departments ballpoint pen distributed, wine gum and mappen with vw-logo.
They are told the hopeful jungtalenten of praktikumsprogrammen and studentenjobs and shows you ways in the company.
Nico selle of the Tu braunschweig care of the project with VW.
It provides for the benefits for both sides: "the students are in contact with the industry and gathering experience."
"VW can, at the same time, students, is interesting candidates closer angucken and think about who as staff."
Such cooperation activities, so selle, are not unusual.
New is that so aggressively by the students will gebuhlt.
"or, rather, the focus was on the technical project," says selle.
The battle for the fresh graduierten will be even harder.
In many sectors, the companies their staff not more from a big handful of candidates to choose.
But they must extol and particularly to highly qualified workers balzen.
Above all, graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the association of German engineers vdi remained in October on 40 000 ingenieurstellen unfilled.
And the so-called ingenieurlücke according to vdi-prognosen will be even greater.
For the wirtschaftsprüfungs- KPMG and consulting firm is novel dykta on the talentjagd.
He is organising elaborate recruiting-events such as the kpmg-race, a kind of modern do, in which the participants on the basis of gps-koordinaten must find their way.
Eight promising students wants to do so in the next year across the US.
Incidentally, the participants kpmg-filialen reputation and the company.
Who decides with must, in two auswahlrunden in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of many applicants flies in the United States.
The slashing and burning at the high potential in the universities will be the guns according to dykta widening.
"We want to deal with the race from the mass withdrawals."
"just a simple segeltörn was not enough for us."
The bill for talentjäger dykta seems to be working.
"We have until today with all participants a similar action in the last year contact."
"Some is in its final stages and want to apply soon with us," he says.
In addition to the direct Court on campus go above all small and medium-sized enterprises also quite classic in berufsmessen on the revealing clothing prowled.
"We are trying to achieve graduates to fachmessen."
"around on the intersolar ', reported, the solartechnikhersteller sitha stübe personalleiterin solarworld.
The Bonn companies around 1 500 staff employed in Germany.
The nachwuchsproblematik stübe know.
At present, on the unternehmenswebsite 35 are put out to tender.
'It is very difficult, to occupy positions vakante. "
"The costs a great deal of time and money ', it says.
Another way is the contact on the uni-professoren.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, some of the university in freiberg.
"The professors give indications that when you make us work experience placements or his thesis letter can."
The solarspezialisten expensive advertising are not needed.
The company is in favour with other benefits for themselves to canvass: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"that can often do not offer a großkonzern," says personalleiterin stübe.
When the money is no longer confined the key role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good career opportunities are further decisive factors.
Solarworld documented in a study of the great place to work institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual bestenliste German employers.
It staff asked how satisfied with your work and your jobumfeld are and is looking to the framework conditions for the employees.
Personalleiterin stübe hopes of the placement also plus points in the jobsuchenden.
"I think that applicants especially after external assessments on a potential employers' look, it says.
Wolf pure kriegler of the German employer branding Academy is advising companies, with a long-term strategy of a good reputation as employers want to build.
His advice is its customers to more authenticity.
And this means, according to the kriegler, especially internal measures.
'the best way, as employer attractive, leads to make on the own staff, "he says.

Obama stop new drilling for oil
Off the coast of Florida us-bundesstaats in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years, there will be no new drilling for oil.
A ban has the government in Washington - and, therefore, their previous plans definitively revoked.
Even before the Atlantic coast new drilling for the time being, remain prohibited.
This shared Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday with.
The trigger for the strict ban on, at least for the next five years is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon "bohrplattform" in April.
Before the accident, which cost the lives of eleven workers and on the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry his readiness, new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want so that the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad.
Who was responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally resolved.
In the centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, faced with milliardenforderungen.
A fact-finding mission on behalf of Obama's is, in the course of December 2008 to present its results.
In October was Interior Minister Ken Salazar the after the explosion bohrstopp imposed lifted.
In the end have had several oil companies immediately requests for new bohrvorhaben.
With more stringent controls and stricter safety rules want Obama and Salazar a fresh disaster.
At the moment the competent supervisory authority, the following many corruption charges was in disrepute, radically reformed.
In parallel with this, Obama has announced, lucrative tax breaks for the oil and gaskonzerne.
The industry now warns publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be substantially smaller than it has been so far.
"The government's plans are the greatest barrier to the growth of the oil and gas industry ', is the result of a current branchenumfrage by the Association of consultants bdo - before the bohrverbot of Wednesday.
The American energy alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the sector: 'No one knows what exactly will change with the regulation.'
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burnt down
The water in rivers is ölbraun, it looks like in the petrol station ausgelaufenes: billion litres of crude oil have nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland destroyed.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen.
Celestine akpobari means well.
"haunts you not 'reassured the ökoaktivist journalists:" You'll still enough oily slime before the lens through which wars. "
The 37-year-old Nigerians who has followed the attempt, a until the chest in water watenden young with the around it schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene almost function.
That, beneath the surface, Brown rohölschwaden, is not to see.
Here you have previously eimerweise shrimps collected, told Esther badom on the shores of bodo-jetty-flusses.
Now is the sluggish fluid waters completely dead.
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung loads of crude oil in the huge river wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo must now six hours to row in fischhaltige waters: located in the heart of the nigerdeltas Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the river realignments criss-crossed mangrovensümpfe will the full extent of the devastation crystal clear.
Instead of water helles wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe who his hand into water comes up, attracting ölige finger.
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the ground, sad I occasionally unbalanced palmen their wedel depend.
Vogelschwärme in wetlands, as usual, are not to be: as soon as the außenborder remains silent, is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise ghastly calm.
'What is happening here, is ecological warfare, "says celestine akpobari gloomy:" We live in constant danger for the health.'
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate.
The area where they live the Ogoni people is a for decades disputed battlefield: here, more than 60 years ago the first explorateure from Europe, organised here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, in 1993 the shell-konzern here had to stop its production, because it for its ölarbeiter too dangerous.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: while from the whole of the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5 000 bohrquellen and 7 000 kilometres pipelines, more than two million barrels of the black gold, are the oil fields be pumped resume oil operations in Ogoniland collapsed, the company is too unstable the situation.
All the few hundred metres stählerne gestelle stand out as bizarre sculptures from the water: "christbäumchen 'will the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned.
They are up to 50 years old, the most to the core korrodiert.
Time and again, promoting good-quality such a bohrkopf akpobari rinne thinks, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres of are experts estimate that in 50 years has flowed into the ecosystem of the Delta: year after year the amount of oil, as you in the sinking of the supertankers' Exxon Valdez "21 years ago in the sea in Alaska drive - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
For the continuing öko-gau who is to blame, this is being fought.
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than else in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard, Steiner, the company: in 2008 alone the rate of defects in the pipes, was "many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place from the distant as a abandoned, ölverschmierte workshop open-air looks, are emerging from the mangroves to make: they are splitternackt and up to our necks ölverschmiert.
Under one of the many casks, the part with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site associated, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie.
This will in the barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours inflamed passions, says Michael, the leader of the group.
First is pressing petrol by the pipes in the auffangtopf spits, later, at the end of the leadership kerosene and, finally, diesel.
So produce Michael and four employees a day to four casks diesel à 300 litres of: 'This brings us 34.000 naira a "- around 22 dollar.
The deltabewohner benefit the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only on a single refinery.
The with barely 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low dieselpreis can still undercut the illegal kocher: because their raw material they get in vain.
He comes from "bunkerern," which pipelinenetz across Ogoniland tap: in this way, the country go according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta every day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisionally zwischengelagerten raw material, however, will fill illegally veredelt: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military belong to oil tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster rather on the population or the lax production methods is due to does the activist akpobari for purely academic.
The oil companies' would not as invaders, and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen do not as thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries. "
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni, above all, to shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the company in question would be: "Perhaps are indeed other nationalities as the Chinese as better."
As Michael nervous.
"high time that their disappears, 'says the muskulöse put.
"every minute can the soldiers."
Will the illegal ölveredler caught by the special forces, are they not arrest, but a painful bribe.
Also the mainly hail from the North soldiers want - as all Nigerians - of the raw material benefit.
"This damn stuff in every respect, our country has brought to the dog," says akpobari.
Investigators discover hazardous baufehler in a380-triebwerken
The A380 is obviously a serious security problem.
Investigators have in the investigation into a notgelandeten machine a possible baufehler discovered, to a 'disastrous triebwerksausfall "could lead.
The airline qantas now wishes to sue the motorenhersteller.
The passengers of the notgelandeten qantas-airbus had at the beginning of November appears to be much more luck than has so far been known: the Australian aviation safety authority in their investigation has a major security problem in the engines of some a380-maschinen noted - and now warns against a possible baufehler.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in one ölschlauchverbindung he could produce ermüdungsrisse and leaks, it was said in a statement published on this Thursday, the authority atsb.
This would have a catastrophic triebwerksausfall "to" can lead.
Have been affected by Rolls-Royce produced in 20 aircraft engines for the a380-reihe.
Including the qantas-airbus, on 4 November in Singapore had to notlanden.
The Australian airline has now taking legal action against the British turbinenhersteller.
It was a klagebegründung in an Australian Federal in Sydney, the him further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-chef Alan Joyce's, said that his airline will claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire of the motors had resolved and share the tragflächen damaged.
A Rolls-Royce oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now up to 40 engines for the world to be replaced.
The Australian investigator announced, further to the superjumbos safety tests, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The sicherheitsempfehlung is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said atsb-sprecher Martin dolan.
The problem of security is for sufficiently important have been kept, in order to inform all those concerned.
After the an emergency evacuation of the qantas-maschine had the airline their a380-flotte for weeks on the ground.

German Bank is seeking a buyer for their twin towers
The German Bank wants to dissociate themselves from their flagship: according to a press is seeking the geldhaus buyers for the two bürotürme at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to EUR 500 million could the property.

So that is Germany's biggest credit institution headquartered already, after a short period of time.
The Bank had the doppeltürme only in 2007 for EUR 272 million of the investors and then adopted a hauseigenen Fund effort.

Thousands of deaths mate
More than 10 000 people have in New Zealand the buried miners thought that the following a series of explosions in a mine have been declared dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the security situation in unglücksschacht more precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, it was in the Pike river mine near the town greymouth to considerable explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years ago have been under days.
A tube was in the unglücksschacht been hinabgelassen, but had no trace of survivors discovered.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions have not attended a meeting for security reasons rescue forces.
The second fierce detonate were the authorities and experts assumed that there is no chance of survival for the mate more.
So far, the bodies could not be recovered.
Now flash families and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people were in radioactive sunshine in greymouth on the New Zealand südinsel gathered.
You remained silent for two minutes.
In honour of the buried miners were 29 tables, drawn up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mate to see.
Also images and personal effects, including items of clothing and surfbretter here, found their place.
Before the Government of the country the flags flying at half mast.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth "would come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John key participants the commemoration.
"but they are never come home. '

As soon as the explosive gases are squeezed out, will be started, the fervent temperatures in the heart of the mine herunterzukühlen, said polizeipräsident Gary knowles to journalists.
To hell, warriors!
The kunstkino fits splatter?
The director Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen new.
To which Members of the public may of the Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought, "as he has turned walhalla rising"?
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (mads mikkelsen) freed themselves from his peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero thuggish tötungsmethoden like to serve and its enemies already time the gedärme from the vibrant, limb if he has bad humour.
On the other hand, as it is actually says einauge is mentioned, the whole film about not a word, and also the other characters can at most be time to one or two sentences, or a few painful todesschreien.
Otherwise, remained silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland, the the wikingerwelt geschwelgt from around a thousand years ago, the scene.
Ideal rather cineasten for adults with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten.
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame that, if they are mutually exclusive.
Director winding refn applies since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher 'as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, refuses but stoical, his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality the arthouse accessible.
Most kunstkino-freunde are the around spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen put off.
At the latest the action-fans then die from boredom, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons, with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem aufbricht and an eternity in slump and fog, before the team seems trapped in America there is, and remains silent.
No wonder, then, that 'walhalla rising "in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images be a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or for a rigorous action, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum.
And from which there is no escape for the viewers.
Hardly refn off a moment of détente and undertakes him with his icy images and the dark trance-artigen's throat soundtrack very slowly, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him from the hearts of the characters runs.
Only a small blonder young, the einauge faithful to the side, preserves something like innocence, all the others will of anger.
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero, whose motives, but never be declared for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warriors from hell will, perhaps to the Ambassador of the devil itself.
It means ruin, but perhaps also only for the already verdorbenen.
"walhalla rising" is a more puzzling film you hate and admire, to annoy, upset and marvel at.
An experience.
Erdarbeiten Puzzle
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, but to take a view on this - nor is it controls.
Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 I at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Tigris; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is dair as-saur.
Your name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley, that of the electricity.
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the also under the name of the middle town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties hardly.
The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern.
By computeranimation blendete you a, where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been, of a fell copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum Yongbyon.
In addition, it presented photographs in the building, from the vicinity show or even the innenraum.
The reactor is just before the beginning of the operation, it was said, but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more than it was then, yes the mystery were in time, a greater.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack in fairly sure was that Syria in el-kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that saw it in the country's nuclear weapons programme 'active'.
Some intelligence officers in Europe there are rather more cautious, and yet only talk of a 'alleged reactor', even if the cia-präsentation for "plausible '.
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was a reactor, to have a high un-diplomat, replied in the summer, the IAEA have only flat "enough material to ask questions'.
The rubble of the alleged "unused militärgebäudes" surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry to one side and planierten the terrain thoroughly.
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which had been produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more significant than that presented by the CIA.
These, however, are starting to get on the market, not because of the unknown contracting authorities - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively.
The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity not independent.
Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program farms or a reactor to have built.
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus.
But the, the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then refuses Damascus, debate on this - as well as on the satellite pictures provide.
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building.
But Israel remains silent pugnaciously.
"We will comment on the never ', confirmed recently the at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
So on the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ', as a high Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna gives - after all, it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area on which the IAEA watchdog.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appear to be three more bodies, the "in functional link 'with the alleged reactor are should - and other than this still exist.
The inspectors have so far not disclosed, at which it is that is still what role they have or what they seem suspicious.
According to information edition of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah described, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns.
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified and that these places on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
It is probably in or directly, in addition to a military base - precisely with this explanatory statement Syria the IAEA are denied access to the three places.
In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military equipment.
Because the nukleardetektive were by a piece of advice of the US intelligence services attention has been drawn to the institutions.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material hertransportiert back and forth.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna has said, at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion'.
There is, however, 'no indications of sensitive activities', in other words, uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes to the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary.
The type of reactor will be pursued with uranium, which is not supplemented.
But where the uranium would have should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues there are at best plausible guesswork.
It is also unclear whether debris, the valuable traces might bring, to the three places have been stored.
As if the hundreds of stands of disappeared from the face of the earth, no one wants to have any information as to where the rubble.
The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Tigris, salzmine al-tibni, the Syria 1998 to their suitability as camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA has investigated as unlikely.
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the renowned magazine Jane's intelligence review with the reactor.
Starting from the orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested.
This can hardly be a coincidence, but has helped to dispel the suspicion.
It also means the IAEA in diplomats, have spent many months, a plan for inspections there, to develop the it Syria should allow any military secrets to real, the burden alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors.
Also, however, Damascus bügelte this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago have been allayed, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, the matter no high urgency, brings about US Ambassador Mr Davies for a couple of months ago so-called sonder-inspektionen into play, one of the strongest means that the Vienna atombehörde has to controls.
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, of these inspections should propose, has already of "an option, for which I am open in the future ', but then it is dragging its feet.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority in the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to are concerns: "What if they find nothing in the end? '
Ladies in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer, with the work on their still nameless regiedebüt has started, there is trouble.
It has the script written, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We know a lot more about this - but that is not good enough for unrest.
There is a persistent rumour, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women " s associations have protested immediately, and some in Sarajevo planned drehtage after Hungary has planted in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary marginalised and in the postproduktion, but it will still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic of the organisation of female victims of conflict wrote about the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, has a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is even Ambassador of un-flüchtlingshilfswerks.
It is not a diplomatic - it has already come to the women a few weeks ago, a meeting in Hungary, which offered the but refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so hasecic.
In liebesgeschichten vergewaltigungscamps it have not been Jolie attitude towards the victims and am betraying their enough about the script.
According to their organisation has recommended that the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk Jolie as Ambassador, reported to dismiss the guardian.
What, exactly, but has Jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian Culture Ministry, to read your script, after some and has a drehgenehmigung granted for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie then, nevertheless, not.
The jungautorin even claimed that they have no political intentions with their film, with great effort, incorporated in the jugoslawien-konflikt wanted the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
On the content, however, remains vague.
So in circulation a second synopsis of the film in the network, the then but sounds rather different: the loving knew it even before war and meeting once again, as you, a Bosnian Muslim, in a becomes Serbian camp being hijacked, in which he is working as a guard.
Which is considerably different sounds as the variant "rape victims in verknallt folterknecht."
That Jolie film in the war begins - that much is certain.
The pressure on you just Jolie, is' unfair and is based on misinformation. "
It can now only, nor the hackers of Hollywood peace: by you give the plot, as so many before, illegally on the web.

As it is, anfühlt elsewhere to build know Mr O 'donovan for half a year.
Because it for the 29-jährigen an engineer in Ireland was nothing more to do it now, is working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just a modehaus high.
In January is further Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His homeland is o 'donovan now only rarely extraschichten, because it makes the credit for his house abbezahlen at home.
'The situation is a bit crazy, "he says when he after a long time, for the first time on the threshold of his house.
"I should have money in Germany for a House in Ireland, in which I am never more."
He laughs something and is by ausgekühlte areas.
The small house is on a fine neighborhood with cherished vorgärten einfahrten park, in the great, expensive cars.
Together with a sister has o 'donovan the House for four years ago bought for EUR 380 000 credit-financed - 100%.
"It was crazy times, there have been simple money without many questions," he says.
Has it afraid that it could go wrong with the credit?
O 'donovan thought for a while, forever fanning hot tea after and says: "I have no children, which I must feed and I am young; even if all wrong, I can start afresh."
The engineer may not taken, that it is often heard at the moment.
"No one needs to go hungry - our situation is far from being as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
'a while working abroad, that is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel we have this only when Irish. "
He laughs and told then of his father, the last great economic crisis to England.
"After seven years ago, it was again the life was in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian tanner like this idea.
The future room for sidestepping and simply look to see how it goes with the lives elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has already been behind in New Zealand and why it should not go well for him and his friend?
There is one thing but still, the him in these days of great concern: the celebration on his 27 birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He is afraid that it might turn into a lebewohl-party.
"just not too many emotions," he says and drink a great schluck of his beer.
'goodbye, this sounds but frightening. "
'We prefer a weggehparty, very firm, with a few friends, a couple drinks, a few play. "
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will more, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States.
This outcome was the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and carried out exclusively in the economist has been published.
Since 1995, this survey is being carried out regularly and shows that the meinungswechsel in this region.
Two facts in the year's survey of September and October particularly in 's eye.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has greatly increased the democratic movement (S. table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 by around 6% is growing every year, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the strong collapse in the last year recovers, is such a trend.
But only half of the people polled in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. graph 2).
Around 44% of the respondents said that you with the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied. That is as much as in the last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts to bring more democracy.
The so during the Great Depression, thanks is probably that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession, and a speedy recovery.
In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz instead.
(according to reports of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, 2009, the level of poverty in Latin America only slightly and is again this year by 32%.)
But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a greater problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime, but to 38% in the last year are the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of the respondents überregional stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007, it was 56% (S. graph 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), even though its left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized.
Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the greatest emphasis in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year).
The people polled in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be accepted.
A '
No one had expected the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of the election agent, the the ill-fated country who rushed to the aid, by far.
Overcrowded polls, several votes cast, ballot papers in the rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just a part of the problems.
With stundenlanger polling stations opened late.
Many Haitians, many of which by the earthquake in January were displaced, streiften wandering in search of a choice.
Finally, some gave on.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged pioneers, because of alleged fraud the lifting of the election results.
Throughout the country, there was partly violent protests.
However, Mr Edmond mulet described, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as a rather well in many respects'.
According to a cautious statement of observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, as seriously as they may be, the process does not necessarily invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidates, Jew célestin, is committed, will the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidate, the rap-musiker Michel martelly and the former first-lady mirlande manigat, have their initial ungültigkeitsklage withdrawn.
If Jew célestin with voters, the little or no agreement will take place, of the wahlberhörde declared the winner of the run-off, this could lead to problems.
Because of the epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, was a low turnout is concerned.
On the day of the election, many Haitians through lack of organisation in the vote.
Just before wahlbeginn were approximately 250, 000 identity cards, election needs, not yet been distributed.
There is a great deal at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
In the middle of secretly
In the weeks after the sudden death of their man was told Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy which their beliebtheitsrate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since your election in 2007.
However, whether you do in the next year to a re-election provides, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband, your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife the economic policy, was often budgets in the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation is not fully into account.
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen spend as it sees fit.
On paper, the fernández-regierung last year the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October has led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another in the face of other proposed, and the Government of the bribery accused), the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss', as the President.
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, which the President has an even greater opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hotly: probably will it this year by up to 9% increase.
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, the 2003 the took office as Argentina of economic crises ridden growth and poverty reduction, said to his primary objectives, and not the inflationssenkung.
He refused to the cooperation with the IMF, the private sector and säuberte has singled out for bullying as the National Institute for statistics and census, which then indec official inflationsstatistiken schönte.
Fernández now can we route?
It has the private sector and the trade union leaders, called upon to talks.
And official statements according to that wage increases in the next year to 18% should be limited.
The high prices for Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost to the economy.
But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in the year 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Cristina Fernández would like to Argentina and back to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former debt restructuring of the country in the year 2001 had rejected.
Now it seems that Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes around $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF elsewhere, as usual, been rejected.
But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado boudou known that the fund in the drawing up of a new national consumer price index "technical support '. It looks as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec.
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support of their husband politically active will be.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely by the kirchnerismus has enough.
If the Argentines from their summer holiday in March, will return to the wave of sympatie, it was shown to be fizzled.
If you would like to gain a further election, it must decide whether it many political choices of its man quietly lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan of its big brother across the straits?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, in order in the five city mayors and councillors. This is as broad evaluation of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
The creation of a partial einschl. cutting-edge business contacts, Ma itself free trade agreement, is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. Its policy has the relationship with the Chinese Motherland, for the first time since 1949 lasting changes.
Ma has the tests, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party was split (KMT) three of the five mayor, it received no majority.
Instead, the democratic fortschrittspartei (DPP), the greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have for Ma problems means.
Since his election two years ago is the part of his party by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even together with the KMT in town councils.
During the election, there was the usual cases like convoys of lorries in Taiwan, with krawallmachern flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and sparse dancers, broke ranks.
There were even the compulsory, mysterious mordversuch.
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT, on the eve of the election a speech to a kmt-kandidaten,
As a man from the amount in the face of fold. LIEN was a umstehender viewers killed and wounded.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or a dispute with the candidates wanted to resolve.
Regardless of the attack has tsai ing-wen according to the leader of the DPP, the election affected and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has provided more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relations with the mainland was not raised.
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's militärbedrohung.
This is why the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the forefront.
But this time, also avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
You responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives to attract the Community.
China sent a negotiators immediately after Taipei, at a summit on security of investment and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants a political integration, but the most important first.
It is so dear to the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP is now reinvented.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: the former party leader, Chen Shui-bian was sitting in prison for corruption.
During its Presidency, between 2000 and 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence.
But under tais reign spans developed into a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young.
As a presidential candidate, Mrs tsai was the DPP huge agreement, like Su tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is doing everything now, in order to show that it is in a position to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion.
Tsai stated publicly that your party a "trustworthy alternative 'offer to MAS vorschneller approach to China.
Chen seems very annoyed about this change.
From his he declared that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He called for the pragmatists Su even, to run for president.
Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult, their possible candidates to choose.
The KMT will need to undergo a own selbstanalyse.
MAS values are poor, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a statement of a kmt-sprechers it will be cabinet and the local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement, only restricted.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese people see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnists, "there is already a point of no return '.

Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere, allow
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart which, amongst other things of arsenic can live, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere.
Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth, is it your view, a sign that a life without the hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible.
'This body has two options. "
"he needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"the power it to something very special, although it almost a form of 'foreign' way of life is', said Paul c.w. Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report that on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science.
So far, six main elements have been regarded as a vital - carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen and sulphur.
But, as the scientists herausfanden, increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further, if it phosphorus by arsenic replaced.
"one wonders what else is still possible," said the co-autor of the report Ariel that Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists life and its forms must recognise, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes that on earth were found.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details to the discovery of were announced, was a cause for widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report of the discovery of außerirdischen life might be.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which in our opinion are absolutely vital, not necessarily see given ', said Charles cockell, Professor on planetary and space sciences research institute of open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research teams.
'This work is a new departure, because it shows that in basic biochemischen processes and structures one element can be replaced by another', added cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
The wolfe-simon Felisa astrobiologischen Institute NASA, the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically same, that microbes that both are exposed, possibly a element by the other can replace.
"The, were aware of the arsens is based, in particular, that there is a chemically a similar situation as phosphorus."
"by the organisms, find it difficult to distinguish an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It has reached in our biochemisches system, where it almost everything," says verschmiert Anbar.
The researchers, the Bacillus gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It suited to and grew.
The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that it also in arsenic can survive, shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can happen, either on the earth or another planet or on the moon, arsenic more often occurs.
According to Jamie S. foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far there was still no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more common, she says, that is why the science assumed that early forms of life there have been used.
"There is reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, which was not a Member in wolfe-simons forschungsteam.
The research were from NASA and the Department of Energy and the national health authorities.

The lion brüllt again after judicial approval of the mgm-umstrukturierung
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties MGM now finally received the green light for a fresh start.
A new-yorker bankruptcy referee on Thursday, the "offiziel" gläuberplan in order to prepare the debt of over $5 billion of loans and the 86-jährigen unterhaltungsunternehmen to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
In accordance with the statements of Thursday met the requirements of the us-konkursrechts the plan, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger birnbaum, the founders of spyglass entertainment,. Barber and birnbaum will the somewhat slimmed-down studio as chief executive officer chair.

For MGM Chapter 11 actually only enters into force when JPMorgan chase a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new mgm-produktionen has completed.
At the moment, opens up a consortium of the investment bank, the even $75 million, the company. The financing will by the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009 with the mission of the investment bank moelis & Co, the management of Renault, the with interest payments to the tune of $300 million / year fought in the solution of their financial problems.
In August, the executive director Harry sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO Enron and umstrukturierungsexperte which, through its activities in krispy kreme doughnuts became known.
The efforts of moelis & Cooper, the finanzsorgen mgms to resolve and the more than 140 gläuber of studios auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected.
After many months of discussions, the parties at the end of 2009, the company to buy.
But the auction, only a few tenderers and nobody wanted to the of the creditors demanded pay $2 billion.
In the spring of this year started all over again, as the mgm-team began with the restructuring plan, after many months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October, at long last, of the creditors was signed.
In the next few weeks if MGM bankruptcy has overcome moelis officially received and Cooper for their work a bonus of many millions of dollars.
The share for moelis & Co. the $1.2 million have already received, amounts to $9.5 million
Cooper, which for the management of the company was paid $375.000 per month, receive a 'erfolgsbonus "of $4 million

You are also two films after 'the small hobbit "in co-produktion with Warner bros.
The studio needs to have a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for his financial share of these two films, under the leadership of Mr Jackson will result.
The investor Carl icahn, around 18% of the mgm-darlehens has financed, sought a merger of the studios with lions gate entertainment, whose main shareholder it is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies led to any result.
Tech toys considers its geschenkebudget in balance
This year's favourite under the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft kinect videokonsole. Both can play a considerable hole in their geschenkebudget.
An iPad costs as much as five bmx-räder for $99, while the price of a kinect-spiel about 10 classic springseilen or around 48 doses play-doh.
But they can protect their geschenkebudget.
Recently I visited in search of three elektronikspielzeugen under $80 three national spielzeughändler - a Wal-Mart, a toys' r 'us and a bj' s wholesale club.

And although less new toys with its own website, will take place on the best known of this type, webkinz Penguin and club, an improved supply.
There are more and more knopfzellen-betriebene toys to the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare akkus.
Here are a few recommendations.
(if not different, are all prices of toys' r 'US.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plüschfiguren, as large as guinea pig, the A grade, if we sing on its stomach.
Even push is consistent with a note by mehrmaliges we can play down a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Respect for: if you have even begun with the press, they can no longer stop.
For a combination of gesand and dancing is the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) the best choice.
On the basis of the last year developed elmo live-technologie offers the animatronische doll recantations as' Simon says', and thanks to the novel scharnierfüße with radblockierung they dominated the moon-walk.
Children who use the equipment quiet where monetary Mickey as tanzlehrer. Their parents complained about the lack of lautstärkeregelung.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you surely remember to alphie, one of the first computerisierten lernspielzeuge.

None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.

Finally, there are still scrabble flash ($30 of hasbro, for children from 8). The five bloc are of no more than a matchbox and have their own led-bildschirm.
At stake, it is a question of the units to words together, before the time. It is great for an improvised buchstabierwettbewerb.
More and more toys have a kind of online-verbindung.
If you only after the supply in the toy shops, are the most important Penguin webkinz and club.
At their child a online-tier the club Penguin, they can, for example, to give a Disney club Penguin 2 'mix' n match figurenpaket ($5 for children from 6 to 12) buy a coin, with a geheimcode contains.

Police action in China will be soft
As a ausbildungsoffizier step Tang shenbin on an urban place, revised its nervous subordinates and gave it with military authority and gedämpfter voice orders.
He wanted, that its female members of the chengguan - China's robust of urban order, feared and contempt for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - the viewers.
"are! '
'Look front!'
"shows you ', he flüsterte to them,' How nice girls as are! '
Four girls, hardly the teenager-alter age, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were staunchly.
Four few black pumps were in gerader number.
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften held its hair.
'for me, you see, on average, from', says Mr Tang dismissive remarks.
"models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried, the image of China's stadtinspektoren polishing.
In a city must all new applicants have a university degree.
The Guangdong province, instead of the graugrünen a leuchtend blue uniforms.
Violence in mittel-china wuhan replaced by niederstarren: 2009 umkreisten according to reports, a 50 officials not properly established and imbisswagen gaze at the operators, by this after half an hour einpackte and left the room.
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, strengthen 13 women the urban polizeistreifen. They have been specific because of their appearance, their good figure and their young people chosen.
They should crude police a softer, femininen aspect.
Unfortunately, however, it would also be very difficult scarlett johansson, the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos have, to improve.
With the right to do so, the critics.
Unlike the police, must these civil servants of the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely a different picture.
In January 2008 beat officials in the province of authorized a spectator to death, as this it with his mobile phone here, filming them as a protest against a dustbin still.
Last year was a schulungshandbuch the Beijing officials stolen and published on the Internet, it is described as criminals can be beaten up without bloodshed.
In this year suffered a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen.
A from violence strotzendes videogame that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China trained officials in an attack on straßenhändler.
"fear" chengguan power of the government, the national newspaper lamentierte China daily in the last year, after further controversy regarding the tactics.
The newspaper called a "really thorough cleansing '.
The current approach for sceptics are clearly inadequate.
As the distrik in October by display eight female recruits, was an editorial in the Beijing evening news, the question whether the women real tasks, or only as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the vacancy notice women were at the age of 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious looking like '.
They should be - on average 1,5m or 5 foot, 2 1 / 2 customs.
The employment ends with reach the 26 birthday.
According to the officials is the activity for women on 25 physically to demanding.
'the most important thing is their image, "was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in the almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com.
Whether the candidates' get the job depends, first from their appearance, as size, weight, gesichtszüge, etc. '
Then come temperament and 'internal qualities'.
"female chengguan are as put," he said, and added, "but they also have other obligations'.
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the City Council of the distrikts, would not agree with this description,
But made to that in China größenvorgaben advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to steady gesichtszüge.
Whether this is synonymous with good look like in China, is controversial.
But people with disabilities or physical corruptions need not to apply.
"We can do here, unfortunately, not a lame or buckligen use ', as Mr Zheng.
"their image would not be good."
Liu Yi, at the close of a monastery baoguang-platz patroliert, is 22, has apfelbäckchen and a well geformten mouths.
They empfindetes not as a sexist that such great store by your appearance.
"you, I see in this uniform sexy?" asks you with ironischem view.
With the grübchen your colleague, the 21-jährige Xu Yang, comments, "we have the task, the image of the city to represent."
You say that you regret the brief attitude is not, as it could have been more ambitious karrierepläne than simply by the alleys traders to scheuchen on business, in order to prevent them.
Every morning deals the some remarks with some 12 straßenhändler trying to foot or on the bicycle as many as possible to sell rolls and tofugerichte fortgejagt before you.
'Mr Wang, disappear, here you please. "
"We have them already said so often," declared frl. Xu a trader who have fled to foot was his on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche temporarily in the lurch.
According to the civil servants is the activity rather monotonous as demanding.
"It is almost every day," says the same Huang Jing, 20, the recreational vertriebswesen studied.
'Everything routine. "
One reason for this is that the women officials the were the traders not, as their male colleagues, must confiscate.
You can only criminals, they threaten their male superiors to report.
This is to protect them from public harassment, which often suffer civil servants in China.
In this year rioted outside hundreds of inhabitants of, Kunming,, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour stock-market boom, chengguan-beamte would have a traders killed.
More than a dozen policemen and chenguan-beamte were injured in the night of the incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge upset or have been set on fire.
Xindu remained of such violent incidents have so far been spared.
But riots are not carried out.
Only two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz, on which the female officials this morning, patroulierten gathered on 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated, contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a workshop was repaired.
The owner cried screamed blue murder.
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with cruel face the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, remained. It was he refers to in order to be namensschild in order to remain anonymous.
As your colleagues to play the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role.
But they have not been trained to present a clean image.
"sometimes go before we verbally."
"but also often physically," says Mr Li well-balanced.
Most of the time, 'people are with the dispute. "
Senator Ensign Public Prosecutor will not charges
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the accusations, which, in his affaire with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband a lobbying, against him, gave the lawyers of Senator on Wednesday known.
This decision to end the most serious rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign, the Republicans from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide for headlines, and his career dampened the thing that it was the possible Republican presidential nominee for President for 2012.
As Senator ensigns bekanntgab office, he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation 'delighted. "
The ethikkomitee of the Senate, however, could impose a disziplarstrafe.
According to the ensigns by the Spanish Ministry of lawyers, they were informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign were recruited in this matter and that no more charges.
The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case.
The judgment was for many ethik-anwälte outside of the Ministry of Justice, a surprise. Their think there is sufficient evidence that has disregarded the lobbying-verbot Ensign.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times were made public, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election agent, helped to lucrative contracts, in order to be silent about a affaire with hamptons wife Cynthia to buy.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign ensigns as National Treasurer.
Ensign, contact some political friends on, at Hampton in work. According to the documents and interrogation took it to you after the attitude hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam, it was allowed to it for a year no lobbying for his former employer or the whole of the Senate.
According to a statement of ethik-experten contravened the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, the before the affaire were closely friend, against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie.
In accordance with the published circumstantial evidence 'to is apparently a consultation and the violation of the drehtür-statuten, "Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, which is based on the defence of clients specialised the targeted by the government.
During the Justice Ministry officially rejected, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to announce, said Mr fire and other ethikanwälten, the Ministry notes in the very careful to political charges for a large number of defeats, of the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year, the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens due to mismanagement on the part of the public prosecutor.
Prosecutors' are obviously schreckhaft, "said Melanie sloan, the chairman of the Association of 'citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington' (an organisation whose objective, the fight against corruption in parliamentary and governance of the United States is), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr Ensign has brought to justice.
"That means in principle that hochstehende government officials now be able to assume that the laws are not apply to you ', added it.
Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday of a public prosecutor and received a further the next day, in which he has been told that the Ministry of any complaints against its clients will rise.
Mr. ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday again repeated, 'in accordance with the law. "
Mr. coggins refused, the legal arguments he put forward to the public prosecutors to explain in more detail.
'I am not, in the gesprächsdetails between the justice ministry and me. Only so much is said, we believe that the right decision to have, "he said.
Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation because of a separate legal action by the Group on ethics, after a payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz have violated.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money something other than a gift.
NV energy, a large company in Nevada, the long time the Senator supported, was one of the firms, in which Mr Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has promoted, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a meeting with Mr Hampton had, in which he told him that he, in the Ministry of Interior, because of a cause "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the Transport Ministers, a meeting on behalf of the airline to reconcile, after these Mr. Hampton to lobbying had stopped.
As last year, for the first time, information on this affair to apologize to light, Mr. Ensign in his electorate and gave his position in the Senate to where he in the order of precedence of Republicans fourthly, had been.
Many months after he was no longer have noticed, told Mr Ensign two weeks ago told reporters that he would like to see a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the objective of police investigation, declared his pressesprecherin, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations einstelle.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," said it to continue.
Twitter carefully cheshire-berufung power
Half a dozen of you tippten in the riots in the courtroom way.
In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies.
In the end, so the defence, there have been more than 140, 000 twitter-meldungen on the process to rape and beds gekettete children in a House that go up in flames.
On Thursday will be closely followed the process of Steven J. Hayes, was accused of, three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, killed, to have a formal end to find, if the verdict has been reached on the death sentence that the selection panel, has made.
But Mr Hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in court, the reasons for appeal to explain and the courts in years to come.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive reporting on the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre 'and a as widespread, instant penetration aufrührerischer details have been, so that the jury illegally, influenced by the public indignation.
This protest could persuade the appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom necessary.
'as I have seen it during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial influenced, "said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger.
The presiding judge, Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, last week the applications by Decision back briefly and when he said that the new media "carefully controlled ', and that there would be no evidence that the jury of passions driven.
But that certainly was not the last word on this matter.
For decades gerichtseinsprüche stated that the reporting of famous cases doubts as to the fairness of a process gives rise.
In its historic decision of 1996, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, of his wife is to have killed, lifted and said in its decision that, given the new media a "karnevalsatmosphäre in Court '.
Some people believe that the television programme and the spielfilm "on the flight 'in this crime is based.
Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the channels of communication from the courtroom, the time of the if Dr sheppard were inconceivable to rules.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in processes of a broad public, are to be concerned," said John J. donohue III, professor at Stanford law school, of the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report, will they arbitrarily imposed.
Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom could out the processes of fair.
The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain in years to discuss, and therefore a condemnation to delay.
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr Hayes these could already have been as judge blue you had not allowed the reactions of potential judges to test, by offering them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed.
Some of the judges have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with horror.
The defenders say you were also the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly have exchanged a jury, of a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have been unacceptable pressure on the verdict, as he would have exercised the unusual decision was made, the selection panel on the weekend freely.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments on the influence of the detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have tabled last month, it notes that the case of the news in Connecticut had dominated and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidate countries.
They argued that the new media continually the flames of the emotions have reopened on the case.
'such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom, "wrote the lawyers," it has previously in new haven and perhaps even nationally, not yet. "
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews said some journalists that the claim that these direct news are rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist, the more slowly than reports will be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view is that the report on future processes verarme.
But some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often faced with the argument, social and technical changes requires the adaptation through the courts.
Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In your objection they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
'this case, "wrote you,' represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can combine courtesy that divides us?
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativity is this week little courtesy in Washington has erupted.
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital return?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and levels of the Congress produced no breakthrough in the major issues, be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government's policy, in which no more decisions are taken.
After all the accounts, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns.
The public meetings of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that continue to the Members divides, hushed up.
It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in the one from the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while claiming even tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration.
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself, and its assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change the atmosphere in the last two years, which prevailed might expect.
Regardless of whether it with taxes, donations, health or benefits is that the two sides are miles away from each other.
Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed.
'No question, the tone has changed, "said pete wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, the now for the' ethics and public policy center" works.
"that is after elections inevitable.
Elections give partisan passions that die again.
And that is a good thing. "
In some issues, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session are Republicans and Democrats, have no other choice than to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts to an end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether it is temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to expect, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to unemployed workers a support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism has risen, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck session 'some and also, at the same time, the New START Treaty, cannot ratify.
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'does not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead, if the new 112. Congress in January will convene.
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"after the things that have to be done is done, will turn this short-term psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I see much of what is happening today in by 2012, as vorkampf, or further shadow boxing, for the hauptereignis from 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House, and to do it with the teeparty-wählern who were instrumental in their education.
How worried about the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, you know that you have to try their promise to reduce the expenditure of the government and health-care reform, to be adhered to.
These parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have adopted, in accordance with their own assessment, so very pressed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to its plan to official recommendation and to make you fight very even in the vicinity of this number.
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget, the taxes and of the health system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as has happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose, will change the course and the compromise must seek.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice of consistency 2012.
So it may be the courtesy, the this week for the display of many Americans, will be welcomed.
But it will on both sides very much more effort, require a common denominator in the questions, the two still separated.
Moscow us-dokument durchgesickertes portrayed as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy 'and you are a part of the bribes and of the schutzgeldes that you einsammelt, further to the Kremlin. As reported in February the American embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and blackmail the staatssicherheitsdienst high protection money so that they can keep expensive standard of living in Moscow, as it says.
They collect money not only of legitimate business, but also of organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical the authority" - takes its part of the money that the head to the top.
The memo, which under the name of Ambassador John beyrle to Washington, was broadcast on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website.
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been redigiert.
It was written, while still Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was in October of President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that, in the meantime, would have been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena baturina, a well-known construction company has over the years, have always rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won many verleumdungsklagen against such accusations.
In September, he declared a Russian TV stations, when he was asked for a documentation, which suggests that he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is bad way, it is dirty."
. An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The have surveys show.
But it is extraordinary that, as in the report of the ambassador, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard, that this by a diplomats of a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some it as' disrupted call 'and to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat as a government," the memo.
'criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminal / the mafia, which literally "roof" or protection means) on the police, the state security (FSB), the dienstaufsichtsbehörde (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow regierungsbürokratie.
Experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"FSB and MVD, the militia are on the second stage."
'least consequences the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom. "
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because the city of no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms from the police and the small business people arrested.
One source, that is to say, "declared that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is best, the protection of the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), as they not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law '.
"This is the reason why the protection by criminal gangs not more so asked as before '.
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, the protection itself very be modest no; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested.
The who do not pay their business, find very quickly - on the basis of one or other vorwands.
Medvedev has spoken about this on several occasions, to fight corruption, but at the same time, has said that he has made very little progress.
The message the memo contains descriptions of men, the with with suitcases full of money, probably, in the Kremlin.
"in his fight against corruption must Medvedev to leave the bureaucrats," said finds satarov, Director of by Moscow, a committee of experts, in a recent interview.
'But he is part of this bureaucracy. "
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, costs, as is estimated by the corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is in place 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence international (countries will be of 'least corrupt "to" most corrupt').
The revelation of the memos the US Embassy in Moscow time evening, what happened, will certainly displeasure within the Russian Government, although, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow can be accused of, it for the Kremlin can also be a possibility to claim that it will resolve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a counterfeiting and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin mentioned.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country is," he said.
"But, to be quite honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, with a kind of pressure and to so unethical way know it."
Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a weak pointed betonierten klassenraum with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong veng high school to the man who, it has built to the later, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok alone.
'everyone here loves Ta Mok. "
"It was a good leader and he has focussed its people," said sreng KOR Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the schlachter ', remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge-hochburg in the north-west Cambodia's popular, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longstanding supporters in anlong challenged veng.
In April, a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims the public confrontation with the people once the regime.
In June, the government has circulated a passed official examinations, that for the first time children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge are told.
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia, for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centres, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, condemned to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear amongst the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, aggravated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
'There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything, "said chhang youk, the head of the documentation centre of Cambodia's, an independent organisation that the regime.
'for them, life under the Khmer Rouge impressive, but the regime is a symbol of evil. "
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people have been executed or they died of diseases, revision or from hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 the pole pot-ied Government underwent fled the leftovers of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
This widespread you until December 1998, when the last movement kapitulierte, mixed reactions.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla warfare of its basis in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, withdrew Ta Mok led the next generation in anlong veng.
But in the mid-1990's, as a by the UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections, led the country's large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, to the government, which urged to the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary 1996 and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and be Ta Mok alone, the, was not given in 1999 of government in the dangrek mountain arrested.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for to his process.
As their benefactors they are no longer protected, the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural of Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgia memory.
Even if a few elite official of the Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten retained their weapons, because they were niederlegten, the poor, uneducated farmers.
"these people have only very little of the capitulation," said Sok leang benefited from the centre for justice and reconciliation, the in Cambodia, also in anlong veng, public forums does
'You are laid down in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime'.
"they grew without any berufswissen."
Sor Lim, 55 years, in 1974, a teenager, the rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle to anlang veng before he niederließ in 1998, to live as poor reisbauer.
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has any something to eat."
"but now is the life difficult, because we are looking after our own."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raises concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, brought to justice.
It is the task of the Court, the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities, to condemn, but it is not said, whether it be through these four cases will pursue further action.
This has done little to the fears in anlong veng.
Current media speculation have agreed on in the chaem, 64 years, is concentrated, the during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, in the province of distriktchefin manteay meanchey.
In 2007, they envoy of the documentation centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma dam, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern probably died.
On a hot night in chaem came from the work in the fields on her holzhaus in a dirty street outside of anlong veng back.
As the sun long shadow on the desiccated grass in chaem accused rejected it, about their past in the Khmer Rouge to discuss.
The Court should they vorladen, it would refuse to go, she said.
'Cambodia lives in peace and stability, "said it.
"There would be no persecution more, would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, would the Court more suspicious charges, even though experts and historians to discuss this.
'Cambodia must dig a hole and disregard the past, "he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said the dokumentationszentrum chhang youk.
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means build-up of the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty, these broken parts together, so that everything can understand."
The Centre has created the first of the government approved passed official examinations on the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of the democratic Cambodia '.
It has circulated the book in June in anlong veng as an annex to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education, the less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge.
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student of the anlong veng high school, said that the new passed official examinations students helps, an important part of its history to understand.
But his parents, as he responded sceptical about the book with home, to it to read.
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the Court from," he said.
'You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people from the Court be condemned. "
Such a resistance makes the process of reconciliation is complex and complicated, said Sok leang.
But the public forums, the passed official examinations and the Court and gain influence, "he said.
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction.

Belarus is in agreement with this, not further weapons-grade uranium accumulate
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material has the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a common statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known.
For years, the US Government had tried to convince, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium and seemed to collect last spring a hurdle to have achieved.
But official of the US administration told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreement with Belarus have been taken 187 pound weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt.
This concerned the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to remove - according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue of anonymous, approximately GBP 500.
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear summit on security of the 47 nations' in April, the Belarus had excluded.
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit of 2012.
'I was truly thrilled about the fact that it has a seat in the nuclear summit on security (from 2012) want. "
'This shows me that it works, "said Ken luongo, President of the partnership global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step 'of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to ensure all precarious nuclear material.
Since the US administration has helped six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of.
Belarus will the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the Government of George W. Bush.
In the time of Obama's nuclear summit on security, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never abandon their uranium.
'How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium, "said Lukashenko does at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will make no dirty bombs and we will sell it to anybody '.
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago the United States when it interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte.
The first round of the uranium to remove Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easy verstrahlt was, say official.
It has been in a spezialzug load, of the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out according to the official by plane.
The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which will not be used for nuclear weapons.
'this was extremely cautious, coordinated and to strengthen confidence, "the to the agreement, which was signed by President Clinton, led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the department, that in the global gefahrenreduzierung works.
The James Martin centre for nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus in this year at least 88 pound waffenfähhigen uranium had, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be according to the common agreement camps by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the US for years been tense, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
"the progress of this global security issues welcome heißend, the United States of America and Belarus aware that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in the improvement of the bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens', it states.
No objections of the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-qaida-gefangenen on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as from a telegram of the Ambassador of the u.s.a. in Madrid.

'these reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information', said the ambassador for a meeting with the public prosecutor.
Despite this, the United States on the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors' more concerned than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and Department of Defense.
'This coordination between independent untersuchern will our efforts to moderate handling between governments complicated', complained Aguirre.

The ambassador has expressed its concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"despite their in general pro-American stance our experience teaches us that the PP not doubt will, from a reminder that the government Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, have deliberately ignored or tolerated, capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the Government of the United States may impact ', stresses.

People's Party won seats in the Congress to 4 and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP Lérida in the cities, Tarragona play a decisive role and Barcelona
After the major stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs in the recent regional elections is the PP their view already on the parliamentary - or not preferred. Their expectations are more than positive, because the votes, the this party in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
So, the Catalan people's party 610.473 vote in the parliamentary elections of 2008, during this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud.
Last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - outcome of the diversion cut rich-country voting shares at the PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP - should continue, predict the analysts of the PP that in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 Members could rise, while also ciu four (it has now 10) before and the PSC at least 9 members (of 25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a Member - currently it has three - while icv their Members or a gain much could keep.
However, the wahlkalender should be maintained, and the next deadline with the local elections in the May 2011. Also then can the People's Party (PP) the voice of the balance of the Socialist domination, in order to put an end, in four provinzhauptstädten and with its majority in the City Council emblematic, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euro for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree, the PSC the towns of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists neither a majority still on its traditional allies (ERC and icv) can make use, will lose.
After the Republican debacle is it not absurd that this party their representation in the town council emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the vote, will lose.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and could to the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the major role to play in tarragonas turnaround. There they had before the current mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros, together with the PP governed.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign you met several times.
Also in other important areas, such as, for example, in badalona castelldefels or reus, the People's Party was a significant growth.
Currently, the PP represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and they are seeking the education of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda thousands of passports
Apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three further in Thailand
The seven of the policemen of geheimdienststelle emblematic of the police arrested Pakistanis and the Nigerians formed the of Thailand managed dschihadistische cell, the different Al qaida-gruppen, including the 'movement for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "laschkar e-Taiba" (let) - the latter was author of the attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior, these investigations, is of great importance, the so far is that he assured us, with the "operation kampai 'is the fälschungsapparat Al qaidas' has been weakened in the world" and "thus their ability to act '.
The researchers assume that in the two years ago, in which the cell in Catalonia, actively was sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where these have been falsified and subsequently to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, have been sent, so that their "fighters" with impunity the borders of European and other Western countries cross.
The revealed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe, and that is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies also other European police units to the investigations. It is not unlikely that it in the area of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks, such as the, the last Tuesday was carried out in Barcelona, will come from.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan, begum tanveer arshad and of Nigerians babatunde agunbiade have been arrested in Thailand) was a further, with the Pakistanis Muhammad athar flounder and zeeshan Ehsan flounder and the thailänder sirikanlaya kijbumrung have been arrested.
They had of Bangkok from the in Spain and other European countries established cell.
The Catalan network - a part of that was in the year 2009 has been destroyed - steel especially tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called 'international Islamic front'.
This means that the documents on the name of men in the age of 25 to 45 years be issued and several years had to be valid; they were not visastempel.
In untersuchungskreisen underlines that until now, no links between the people arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay shown to have, although the author of this attack, "laschkar e-Taiba" was, one of the draw the in Spain stolen and subsequently in Thailand fake passports.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from by means of a geldtransfer-unternehmens several thousand dollars were sent in the purchase of prepaid-karten for mobile phones, "" have been invested, the later by the members of the 'commandos "that the lives of 106 people, an end to have been used.
The police have comprehensive documentation seized.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement of MAs
The chairman of the PPC, alicia sánchez-camacho yesterday, took the opportunity, artur MAS personally their conditions to support his first day as Prime Minister of the proposed. These are no different from the already during the election campaign, and may be raised with the absolute priority of the economic recovery and the failure of regionalist unabhängigkeitsabenteuern, as a finanzausgleichsvereinbarung the regionalistische leaders at the height of its mandate wishes to propose to summarise.
The chairman of the Catalan people's party thus with the safety of artur MAS it by the 18 Members, which they had won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than adequate, in order to feel is essential, because the candidate of the bürgerlich-regionalistischen party ciu is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties during the vote, when he took up office, abstaining.
The future alliances, the the regionalists in the next parliamentary elections in Congress, intend to depend on a possible Entente with the PP. The talks, the MAS at the time with the other parties leads, however, Catalonia.
What the leader of the PPC is concerned, this calls for that to support the first day 'all discourse, the the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia concern', as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - as happens in the Basque country - and the leader of ciu even want to a referendum, at the back.
Two political leaders is common characteristic of the oversized political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and the level of inheritance and geschenksteuer wish to abolish.
With the details of the negotiations on the office of MAS, deal from the PPC Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat.
MAS has already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - of a tough opposition announced - and Joan Herrera (icv). Today, it will Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan laporta (solidaritat catalana).
The altenpflegeheim confirms that the deaths not to 'lack of measures "are due
The owners of the altenheims in olot not conclude from that their carers on eleven older people killed
The leaders of the altenpflegeheims la caritat olot (Gerona), in a press conference yesterday, in which it out to the damage the criminal acts Joan Vila dilmés - the carers, which, during its work at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - the institution had done.
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, resigned in the company of his lawyer, Joan cañada, tried to and announced, "la caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) indictments', but 'the right and our accountability require it the process and the civil liability'.
The establishment must not only a social being discredited, because they accept the criminal actions of the pflegers not identified in good time, but now also pay a high allowed by the rechtsvertretern of the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crimes on August 2009 fall and it since been murdered have further.
The judge ordered the fate through the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the altenpflegeheims -, because he was suspected that no doctor the late personally have investigated the formalities, but because of their age and diseases by telephone.
The head of La caritat verneinte flatly this point and stated that 'lack of adequate measures keinerzeit the reason for the incidents may have been. "
The lawyer of La caritat also added that it 'in the legal dispute no evidence of negligent acts of a person as the accused. "
The already as "Angel of death 'getaufte acknowledged eleven murders and said the day before yesterday, the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La caritat said the access of the staff to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail, the carers in six of the nine crimes committed to the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests will tell whether Vila is lying, and for its first victims in fact a less cruel death or whether he chose this from within by giving you ausbrannte bleichlauge according to mention, as he had done in three women confession that he between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat listens to the statements of the pflegers not believe, not even as the number of gestandenen murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different things in court and that it had made no sense, his approach after eight successful murders suddenly to change.
You say that you were you, therefore, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice available.
Kowtow to the European Central Bank (ECB)
Yesterday the investors responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President, Mr Trichet, the warned, "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to react."
The risk premia the euro-peripheriländer are increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks is more than 5%.
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB and the euro fooled can hardly points, which has led to the concern, not to be underestimated.
The events of yesterday are typical of a illiquid market, to the extent that it breaks down are recovered, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose its fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank has called on us to reverse our liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably even many times in the future, taking a step backwards.
The Bundesbank, called for must of the plan for the purchase of government debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only a einwöchiger permanent access be maintained.
After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen 'at least until March' extended and the quarterly invitations to tender with unbegrenztem access on quartalsende to ensure the liquidity at least until June to be maintained.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continue and a stärkendes signal will be spent.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday set back again and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, can only God help us!
Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May, in which the Bank reiterated, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to consider the markets and then collapsed, could this history repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it demonstrated the teeth and on Wednesday, she said, much has to have bought, provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year staatstiteln in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28%, compared to 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal in the whole of the curve and reflected a wahrnehmungsveränderung of markets after the words Trichet's.
In Ireland has been the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied and Bank of Ireland published.
The sum is to about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000 estimated. There is time to February, in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests in July had not recognised, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce, the uncertainty.
However, the government on Tuesday the parliamentary assent to his new budget. As they still do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has their discourse on the summit of Heads of State and of Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity asked to show that together we play the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish regierungspräsident yesterday the plan of action, the Friday to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, the dismantling of the staatsdefizits, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation schemes. The measures in the ears of the investors as vivaldis four seasons.
The sabbatical year Zapatero and Mr Trichet, explains why the Spanish stock exchange by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
In comparison with the February was the response of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing, and we will benefit from the surprise result.
Today there is a crucial auction a three-year bond, which might the benefits from trichet-effekt. That is why we will draw on a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit will remove.
For Spain would be the application of a hilfsplans a self-sacrifice.
We would liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in the march. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would without any notice closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should Caesar " s wife must comply with the slogan: "now is not only that, but also appearances."
Only courage that we create!

Without the capabilities of the German pilots and weltmeisters Sebastian vettel or the leistungsstärke of the motors of Renault going to reduce want is the "geheimwaffe" that the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus a siegerteam created, on the legend.
In reality is a powerful software to simulate of processes which the German company 2007 to purposes, which do not have to do with motor race, on the market brought.
This as plm informatikprogramm was called for the development of montageketten in factories throughout the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used.
The goal is an exact reproduction or simulation of a product or process, before this, indeed, is being built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and of the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan easier.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens, declared that the use of these software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull 'in a few hours, almost in real time, "the changes and improvements to the race and with the tests are discovered, draw up and can carry out.
Russwurm leads from that in 1992, in the rennställen average ten technicians worked in a season of a maximum of three or four improvements have been able to introduce.
In red bulls team today are 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful do they lead analyses and all possible changes to the rennwagen by.
The siemens-manager stated that the plm-software is in the situation, all elements of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the motors, for the only Renault responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed.
The changes can thanks to progressive production plants and hightech-autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of simulators in reality.
The only border, the this crazy technical perfectionism is set, are the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 - team for his race in a season should spend.
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London off the ground.
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly of journalists - are very limited.
All that is happening is top secret.
The workforce is 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champion vettel and mark webber.
But red bulls true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources which the energy-drink-hersteller in the services of its participation in the race tracks, hide other protagonists, whose support invaluable and their profile is zero.
The technologichef of the plant, Steve nevey, stressed that five years ago could even say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50% to victory and contributed to the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots to 15%.
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiatoren."
In two years will hp twenty own shops with local producers of open
Hewlett-Packard (hp) weihte yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive Laden in collaboration with his partner ront Reyes.
It is the first one from twenty shops existing verkaufsnetzes each with 80 to 100 square metres, the multinational firm in the next two years in Spain intends to open up.
The society agreed this initiative with the existing 16 verkaufsbereichen in mehrmarkenbetrieb, such as, for example, PC city, such as Carrefour and Saturn devouring and El Corte Inglés.

The North American corporate group intends to 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 to set up branches in Spain.
The first were in Bucharest last week (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) unveiled. Barcelona is the third business.
The next neueröffnungen Herrera wanted not betrayed, but not from that Madrid could be the next target.
The Deputy Chairman, the also head of hp staff system is, assured, the philosophy of ladeneröffnung is always the same. They support on a local distributors with experience and branchenkenntnissen.
The North American group of companies is discussing this and is taking the exclusive ladenausstattung (with interactive products on the issue.) in Europe will be the same all shops.
Hp is also responsible for the training of ladenpersonals.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising-system and stressed that with the exclusive verkaufsstellennetz intends that "the after-sales service and advice to the purchase of small and micro-enterprises, and then, even to optimise the packaging '.
The Laden in Barcelona has a pionier-pilotprogramm, that the technical problems the hp-geräte with guarantee solves.
A online-service builds a link to the technical central in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, sometimes up to two days. '

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years ago a million customers' grip '
The caretaker Member of the board of Banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, and he believes that 2001 a tough year for the banks, but first will be rejects a new liquidity crisis and the end of the schuldenkriegs predicts.
Nevertheless, it provides for a collapse in zinsspannen advance, the banks with increases in charges and try to balance the prices for loans.
Sabadell expected in three years ago, a million retail customers' - a still to existing fields.
Sabadell has found the way, to use the next three years, and so in a very complicated economic environment to survive.
The Bank will introduce a new dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The objective is not only to survive, without the public aid from the frob to take, but also of the market share a million retail customers - 700 000 if the customers, the Bank - to increase will lose. This is the great challenge that this bank, because up to now it has its business customers, more attention than their retail customers.
In this year it has 250 000 and 50 000 companies to retail investors.
Their access to the market in retail customers is 3.5%, while the business customers, more than 10%.
Another principle of geschäftsplans 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, in other words, reducing costs austerität. The challenges that the Bank so that, will you, together with the present statement.
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times, to publish the objectives and, as a result of the financial crisis around the world, all plans of the banks are in disarray.
Sabadell this year will be its four years ago guide whose use optima. This was initially on three years interpreted, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended by a year.
The customers, the savings banks will leave, are the main objective of the Bank.
In a apie organised breakfast guardiola stressed that 2011 would a 'difficult' year "with great scope."
The managers assumes, Spain would only "slowly 'out of the crisis.
It would also be very difficult, "" in two or three years' to create work '- is vital for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war of liabilities - of the zinsmargen punished - will wane, will raise risk premia, the banks and for their emissions to the conservation of liquidity, have to pay, as compensation for the reduction of profit margins have already passed on to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are of a structural nature and they will exert pressure on the credit."
'We have the tap off down, but the zinsdifferenziale are very high, "was to guardiola.
On Thursday BANESTO was already ordering their filialnetz from, the granting of long-term loans to restrict and to increase the zinsdifferenziale (cf. CINCO Díaz on 22 and 27 November).
The managers also acknowledged, the banks, at the moment the stategie pursued, "to increase the charges', but 'within a competitive framework'.
Sabadells guide whose use is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assured that in Spain 'larger companies are necessary. "
"in the coming year will change everything," he assured.
It stresses that the need for capital 'and' enormous is rising at the moment does not exclude the fact that some Spanish financial institutions in red figures slide.
It is of the opinion that the kaptitalaufstockungen frob could replace the monetary market.
After he assured that sabadell also a temporary closure of the markets could survive, he refuted the argument of some bankers, the already a new liquidity crisis predict.
It stresses that nothing can be in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, we can achieve on repogeschäfte short-term funding and so that the crisis interception.
CECA fills a second wave of mergers of savings banks from
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta, dismissed the opportunity yesterday to a wave of mergers, that it might be the savings banks and emphasised the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
As the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks to participate in the first phase not. They retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes (CECA), José Antonio olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
'I believe that most of the mergers is concluded. The inclusion of cajasol in the group Banca cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it was rather adaptations. "
"the greatest part is finished. It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been from Banco de España, all transactions has strong support, controlled."
In a by the association of the directors and managers aragoniens (adea) organised breakfast led olavarrieta from that of the concentration process "as quickly as possible, has taken place and that we must be satisfied with the timescales set the end, in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been laid down," he emphasised.
'the transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million vermögensbestand to 17 with ever 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now very much greater, and that is what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement', highlighted it.
Olavarrieta stated that 'there would be a number of unabgebrachter opinions on the slow pace of the process, the unseriösität and absurdity' revealed, because "Banco de España reminded us, before the end of the year. '
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorosesten financing systems of Europe and 'perhaps "around the world have and added that those who anzweifeltenn this' without deeper knowledge 'would do.
The managers has said that we are in the current economy 'no' on the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks need to do a "very important 'concentration process have gone through, the" as quickly as possible' will be completed.
He reminded us that the Spanish banks the stress tests, which the ECB in July, very good had existed.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided for keeping the euro but, at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have a dual response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented, starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, the no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of the management of airports, AENA Barajas and El Prat and 30% of state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister who supported, Elena Salgado, with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, as responsible that the current crisis have herausbeschwört.
How are these events to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future, the with the retention of the ancient traditions of much of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern.
The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although that currently, rather, for science fiction sounds -, supported by a large proportion of public opinion, around 50% of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries which are invading the benchmarks; möglichereweise the default of some countries, and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector.
The German position is clear and is for some time already. That is why there is now no excuses.
First, in 2009, as both the IMF, as well as the European Commission incentives for deficits created and the German Government drew up from a constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016.
That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict steuerpläne and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal, a central European country, as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful.
At that time, it was the criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position; it calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to allow the saving of a country and, at the same time, the private lenders to commit to a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because they are the irlandkrise and all the following through on.
But your proposal, if somewhat sweetened, was accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has a red line, not to exceed the it does.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures have to be made - it from that date the old functioning of the euro will not be.
2013 will the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, can be forced to declare itself bankrupt, and in this case the private sector must take a share of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve the productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The other alternative, the on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would be a bad thing to do to it not to understand.
It is not just a question of the general government deficit until the year 2013 to three per cent runterzufahren.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat.
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm.
And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013, make use of.
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, its own house in order, to create their way has been.
But the of Germany was not bold enough red line is there, and it does not seem that change.
Under the contemplating opportunities is that we the with little serious countries fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out.
In this case, could Germany are still say that it have warned us.
Sport and regelumgehung
As the tricks of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction.
The supposedly of two players of the Real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) evidenced by the exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax of the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled on whether it is a unsportliche act or not and whether was possibly both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende (your team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now so that the referee you the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would, will be the two players in the next ligaspiel the prescribed sanction against the auxerre fulfil and so without cards in the next spielphase embarkation.
Finally, the population of the UEFA disziplinarkommitee the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two play and the relevant players with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it forms part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in the sport - is our rules.
Part of the law debate about the case described, is due to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished the major role played), and on the dramatisierung by mourinho, of an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians has added.
In any case, is the debate about whether this does not expressly prohibited behaviour of the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport, seem but whose sense.
In this matter the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions do not, because it was not a aggressive game.
A further aspect of a clean game is to prevent the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam. That did not happen either.
The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not taken place in secret, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sanction joyful.
Another question is what kind of benefit the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has brought benefits to the gespielte game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because of the club does not then on these players.
The advantage is that the players the next spielphase the Champions League without cards, which your participation in a future game, could threaten begin.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because the team at some point could also retiring. Also receive the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus on, in which you because kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle departure.
That means that it is not clear whether it is really a advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also strategic decisions from the rules that will allow a maximum benefit.
In this case, wanted to circumvent the players are not a sanction (that is, indeed, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, when it is dealing with this.
You met a strategic decision, without a penalty or to flee to avoid before her.
Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of imagination.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was two selbstausschlüsse and because of the way the provoking regelübertragung.
The harm that the principles of sport has been done by these acts is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
The angebotoffensive kundenfang for gruppen-weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar, this year an avalanche of reservations on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The employees themselves are paid celebrate. They do not want more than EUR 20 to 30 spend.
As the turrón and the weihnachtslotterie there is again in the run-up to the hotel and gruppenabendessen freizeitgewerbe emblematic oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, where you resolve a preisoffensive from the kundensegment, also, that the great mass, ': almost all want between 20 and 30 euro for a mittag- spend or dinner, confirm the respondents entrepreneurs and associations.
So that the accounts a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) all orders in the week of 13 December to fall, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner in two spitzentager (the 16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, as the bad times began, many companies the gruppenabendessen, for budgetary reasons.
In order not to give up on this tradition, many workers must pay this from their own pockets.
As the economy, it is also always be called for niedrigstpreise, confirms the chairman of the gaststättengremiums of Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the dachverbands until now is not to predict how the public holidays in this month will be.
"people are considering 'tens of times before they are implemented."
'you would like to, but they respect heavily on prices, "he said.
The business will go well, "in which the quality at good prices with a good service ', he added, and calls to remind us that the customers in times of crisis, why prices in order to save EUR 25 most be in demand.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of 17 December 2008 the providers to collapse.
The Group soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention to spend less than EUR 30, would be going gangbusters. The group has its menüs with komplettangeboten between 25 and 35 euro adapted to the economic situation.
In a different political group, andilana, the 16 restaurants in the city has (hostal de la Rita, market, La fonda and other), has the peculiarity of the calendar early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
'We have the impossible, the vorjahrespreise with menüs for any taste of up to EUR 30 to maintain 19,95, "he says.
In to grup, the El mussol attic, ququ, and a total of 23 local, you lose the optimism not once since the second quarter of the revenue again bloom and good, even if a few days focused prospects for the weihnachtsgeschäft just.
Sources of group of companies would point out that the 18 a überaktiver day with freundesgruppen, the Christmas vorfeiern, will be.
To the six gruppenmenüs was a weihnachtsmenü for EUR 30 or more than preishit added. One has the impression that the customers are prepared, 10% more than in the previous year and, in exchange, to spend more details, such as, for example, cava.
Also in some companies, it sees Green sprossen are, once again why the employees will be invited. This gives the impression that the gruppenessen once again in the recovery.
From the dachverbands fecasarm (with mergers as the kneipen-, restaurant- and freizeitverband of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, enric gomà, to the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations as a whole right 'fresh', despite the customers' a maximum pennies. "
The enjoy the celebration is, however, has not fallen, regardless of who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is of great concern in the United States
Islamabad is nuclear weapons' faster than any other country ago. "
Revelations of WikiLeaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The of the Internet portal WikiLeaks revealed content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the us-staatsabteilung confirms the enormous concerns Pakistan's nuclear program Washington.
In the margins of the explanations and hefty details, the documents on the content of the discussions and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety is not strengthened but, on the contrary, "is falling," and that the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons' to a faster rhytmus than any other country ."
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are put together, but their parts to be stored on a possible attack their destruction to more difficult - are preparing Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Petersen, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: 'the proximity of some nuclear installations on the of the Taliban beleaguered area, the supposed verstreuung of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials'.
The large number of people in the nukleararsenale and the raketenprogramme implies, will not only by the United States, but also of Russia as a ausufernd and reason, caution, regarded.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges staff to guard nuclear installations, because of the low educational and cultural standards extremist organisations have more opportunities to people who are involved in nuclear or raketenprogrammen reklutieren, to cooperate," said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his American counterpart.
New to the Julian assanges Internet portal exposed documentation is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace, in the Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, from an Office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as a "frustrating 'describes, declared:" There are often no transparency; on offers of help we received no answers or they are rejected. "
In another communication confirms Peter lavoy, officials of the state secret service for South Asia that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The Ambassador Petersen is asking Washington during a visit of the Supreme heeresleiters,, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani,, the responsible 'to make it clear, "that" Pakistan's army to stop its tacit support for terrorist groups'.
In the race for WikiLeaks head
Obama will appoint a high those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning to the persecution and capable of Assange.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founders, jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which the only difficult to investigate the facts.
Interpol yesterday was a 'red warning "to" search and persecution' of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional orders to arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden.
It also assured the advocate of the founder of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, "the police would know where and how they contact with Mr Assange."
On 20 was already the international police authority with headquarters in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but it was up to yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities.
That is the way things are interpol-länder. The 188, Assange need to identify and, presumably, "to provisionally arrest and hand it."
Although Interpol the arrest of a of a red warning affected individual not can impose, many consider Member States according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - the of the national police forces must be carried out, in particular, if you have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably.
The approach is outraged assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which you about it, that the 39-year-old founders of WikiLeaks is prepared by video conference, the questions of the Swedish authorities to answer.
They also recall that Assange the departure from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, the with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorisation.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution ', will, in the letter.
While the world is seeking him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son claimed - that Assange in an unknown location to, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of the magazine time by Skype from a vague place from an interview. In the conversation, he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"if it can be proven that it was responsible for the classification of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and international agreements signed by the United States has broken, they should resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the pressesekretär of the White House, Robert Gibbs, condemned, of the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
'I am not sure why we value to the opinion of a type with a website should lay, "he told the CNN.
Obama himself has a high those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell Travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen.
The attempt by the spokesperson of the präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange less attention, is contrary to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, the from January the Presidency of the House of Representatives in the national sicherheitskommitee will lead the staatsabteilung, has the possibility to investigate WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organisations, 'in order to put their money to seize and all the support it or to make a contribution to follow. "
Tom flanagan, consultants, of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange "are murdered" revoked.
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and a not manned flight or so what use."
Who is not apologising, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
'who it was who in the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is eiine to mild punishment, "he told the sender Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allows the party a secret vote on its continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes rudderless ERC from the way to go.
The Party's leader is aware that its threat of resignation the close of the former Labour party whip Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as your mentor itself, and not the same headache will bring, as other former tendencies.
Therefore tried the leaders of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to gain, what its position until the next local elections would secure.
For the beginning kündete yesterday that the over 200 Regional Council members of ERC is about his remain in office could express secret.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the carodisten the präsidenen a fine miss, could you wanted to do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head would like to both the impression of division, as well as the of subjection to avoid his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would with half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed, and he added without any indication of prozentwerten, a result of 'in the Bulgarian style' would be a good thing.
The Carod by the President, who are close to call for more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since puigcercós the supreme body of the kongresse controlled.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance resignations have will you with the chairman of a vorgehensplan from now until May.
For this they expect in the drafting of the document on strategic change of direction, the management on 18 to the vote in the Council, will be able to participate.
Its intention is to guarantee, for puigcercós. In return, these promises, the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what the leader already for a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphonie" a pity the stability and it seeks once and for all, the organisation in the situation, their dirty laundry wash behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article of the President-in-Office conseller Josep huguet signed up to in his blog, symptomatic.
In view of this, the puigcercós is an ideologue, considered the holders of innovació it for a fact that the party leaders' in exchange against various objectives' will be based.
He was five to, two of which the priority.
Firstly, the 'restructuring' of the governing board, so that this at least 90% of the Party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from carods environment.
The second could the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the vollversammlungsprinzip as operation.
So he verfechtet a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the kongresse with elected delegates.
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is puigcercós' team that already on the last two conferences, obsessed with fought for it.
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a congress on the reform of the Statute should deal.
This deadline is still out, since infogle the internal aufruhe of recent years tackling this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, could be the time has come, in order to take up the matter again and for ever.

With literature the finger on the weak spots
The second round of 'the desire of the language' was a walk in which the participants for the narrative strong,
'this with the sex in the language I do understand, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me? "asked the writer Luisa valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua' should open up a cycle, the spanischsprachige literature celebrated and on that occasion the subtitle your question used (on another event was the Round Table devoted to the sex in the language, it declared).
The finger on the wound... 'brings us in difficulties, "the Argentine spuckte schriftstellein sweet the audience that mainly from young people at the international zusammensetzte book in Guadalajara (fil) met to this by marisol Shultz moderierten round table, to attend to the valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa valenzuela Las a text which they Gonzalo celorio and of the Shultz then as a great narrative marked. Luisa told and is in the first person were the originator on the search is to know what a 'wound' is, and by the doctor to doctor is, of which you are no answer, but evidence of the guide to its narrative.
The infektologen leaves you convinced: 'patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound. "
At the end, after a very frustrating rapprochement to the trauma theorists, of her in the middle of the way the breath raubte, and of their but stated that wound is not a scientific concept of enthült psychoanalytiker the secret: "The wound that is truly open, the symbolic is the scar."
The like the narrative sighs easier and includes that they "of the wound only learned that this really open and does not exist '. But it is convinced that the desire of the language and their fall mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with two.
The Nicaraguans, Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise of the invention', and in which the finger on the wound not mentioned, but will be detected.
With reference to the magical realism he tells of a famous zauberin, which struck the clouds far gereiste men or the of a girl was lost virtue wiederherstellte. The narrative made a U-turn and reported of America, the great novel, the it from the very beginning not to his own chronisten was missing, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, of the abundance of of the eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, the US all (the writer) invited the hypothetical quality, spottete witnesses who have been outlined in the true stories were present, but in a different way would be the history of America's never been told - with imagination, even the shame has disappeared."
However, stresses, "it is the crazy and liar, the best things imagine ', and there are coming closer to reality and lie to each other, where we no longer know which side the narrative is one where the fictitious literature the Summit achieved.
He calls the, in fact, the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, what are being told."
As to the number was Mayra Montero, annotated and praised the writer of the diversity of the interpretations, to which the invitation of the fil to the round table 'the finger on the wound' contributed.
The kubanerin and puertorikanerin devoted their contribution of the great wound of social violence, which affects their country - as all of Latin America - as a result of the fighting for the drugs trade.
'I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment contain', said after she had highlighted that literature communication and binding force is, between the author and readers, like a "chemical reaction" to build on.
The evening, the Spanish poet, Luis García Montero, whose contribution also 'these fingers of committed writer in the wound of the writer' hevorhob.
He said that, in a very fast-moving world also the intellectual habits and the control of the awareness on dogmatismen, and forget that 'that behind every confirmation of a small no is behind every denial and a small yes. "
"to be in possession of the idea and the reality of the situation, we must set an example, and often puts into perspective, the focus on a burden and to those who, the much feel more comfortable, if it is in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuances thinking, and also the powerful to harass that prefer, the world in black and white them he observed and invited to rediscover the meaning of the letter.
Romano is fighting for its first title
Rubén Omar Romano is looking to three defeats in endspielen back, he has again, and (seen in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, there are also two different, of their respective coaches stipulated styles, and their of contradictions, this meeting is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano is looking to three defeats in endspielen back, he has again, and (seen in his career, but three times, it has had a decisive games, and so far he has done well, why this opportunity is of very special importance is for him.
The Argentines with the coin has played up to the second champion, he is a step lagged behind the victors and, amazingly, he has fought with the same team consecutive endspiele.
The santistische strategist, the first end game as coach in the 'torneo apertura 2002', as del morelia the reins in the hand, with which he had against toluca with 4-2 learned a great defeat; later, at the 'clausura 2003' he reached the crucial match that he also with 3-1 against rayados lost.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'torneo bicentenario 2010', in which you played against Los diablos rubén again, had to absorb a setback, since the game with 2-2 against Los choriceros after 210 spielminuten undecided, but the penalty he came with 3-1 forward and received two ways of losing its title, but ultimately failed three of its players the eleven steps and thus the game to a 4-3.
Rubén had already two endspiele with the diablos rojos and one with Monterrey, his main rivals, lost. That is why he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid itself of the evil zauber, for the first time a title celebrating, although it confirms that the most important thing for it is the game itself.
'I would like to be champion, I would break no statistics, that is for a club, for my affection, of which I am hingebe, and that is why the title will come to see me, but what happened before, is the most important', annotated the at, as it consulted about the lost endspiele.
The last endgame is still greatly stayed with him, he assured us, to have learned a lot from it: "the only lesson we can draw from this, is that to the referee not the end obeyed, can we not celebrate on the line, we are also prepared, the players, because the last time we were with two elfmetern already prepared, a decent way, and I believe that this is a lesson, until the game is not over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series of penalty stage could be decided, concerned not him, because he trusts his players: 'you want never misery, we would like to conclude in the regular spielzeit, but sometimes, there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the strong desire, the title already in the hands, the left us with something to this end game, and we hope that this time it will not come to this'.
It is in romanso power, not only second champion and, for the first time to be the glory to costs, the title.

The clandestine immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, the according to the government, the problem of the with secret immigrants landing ships rules, will most likely be scrapping, after the three opposition parties on Wednesday have announced that they cannot support the proposal.
"I am strongly against this Charter on. '
"I think with a party that you shackles at the feet has placed ', said Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the liberal, after the expiry of the weekly caucus-sitzung before the assembled members.
The liberal claimed, the draft law, any of the permitted a than on the transport of illegal immigrants identified seeschiff next person to stand up to a year, as proposed, would violate the Canadian legal and freiheitsverfassung.
Gilles duceppe, head of the bloc québécois, as suggested in the draft law, not to support, as it is against the wrong target group.
'We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will have to wait and see what the government is doing', said M. duceppe.
The criticism about the immigrationsfrage of Olivia chow, NDP party, has dismissed the critics, the call for your party are not firm enough to the hidden immigrants.
"The neo-demokraten agree that it is taking measures against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do by conciliation of another law, of the c-35, to impose," led to chow.
We are in favour of the draft law of the Conservatives, therefore, not because he is seeking the blame on the refugees and children, at least for a year prisoner ', said chow.
The immigration minister be judged has happened to Jason kenney accused the opposition parties, with the policy to play and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians share to the honourable Member that it will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, the criminal processes that Canada and the country as a a doormat."

The new unity will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, the unity of the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean charest many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert dutil, Minister of public safety, claims that this idea come not yesterday: Quebec would have already last January the New York department of investigation consulted on this issue.
The metropolis since 1870 on a standing unity against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement by Wednesday has more than just a surprise.
We have to say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the quebecer police force on 29 October of last year, despite the presence of Robert dutils not in the least been discussed.
There was also not that Stéphane bergeron, critics and Member of the Parti québécois, this announcement in terms of public security as "out of the hat gezaubertes rabbit 'and' on a will rightly gebastelte solution 'qualified.
Minister dutil had written in turn to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the future unity can have.
'You will be the result if we shall be announcing', therefore, he is.
"It is aware of this matter."
In accordance with réjean parent, the President of the csq, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. charest, insists on the education of this committee of inquiry, we want to prevent, the more people will as you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"the only means to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean charest ', as stated, for its part, Yves boisvert, lecturer for ethics and politiksysteme to the ENA (staatl. College for the training of high administration).
In order to escape from this impasse, it proposes the Quebec, the finanzprüfungskontrolle a specific mandate, so that these on corruption and hidden agreements appropriate investigations.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the prüfungskontrolle," he decided.
It is also of the opinion that the Quebec of prüfungskontrolle could give the same powers as Commissioners, whatever you would allow the people to commit to the statement.
The formation of a possible unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government charest.
The Quebec Ottawa will also demand that the penal code to alter, in order to better to this type of crime to be discontinued.
This demand from the Procurator General of the operation of the Minister of Justice, marteau Jean-Marc Fournier informed, that the jurisdiction in this type of law enforcement is not clear.
Vic toews, Minister of State for public security, for its part, confirmed, his colleague from the judiciary, rob Nicholson, are currently concerned with certain, this dossier a rolling update apart.
During the operation printemps 2001 that the groups concerned, were the motorradpolizisten 131 people have been arrested, although the penal code was not been revived.
Ottawa, as a result, the law against gansterism enforced.

A Dupont on the part of censure
The quebecer rundfunkmoderator Stéphane Dupont has before the Canadian supervisory board for rundfunknormen (ccnr) because of its controversial statements on social welfare, and Haiti, as well as for its ausfälligen way of talking about Funk a partial setback.
The ccnr is of the opinion, M. Dupont and his Choi 98,1 fm-team would have the right to their own expression, but certain statements "inaccurate information on the social welfare and unjustified negative images of the Haitians and also contain such a ungehobelte expression, the programmes broadcast the during the day is not appropriate."

The aktivistenorganisation had complained that the figures quoted in the programme are imprecise.
The mediators should, rather, solid and give misleading information.
On the subject of suicide had a moderator Stéphane Dupont is of the opinion, the suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of company boards had drawn the conclusion, the message is that suicide not as a solution of lebenskrisen should be considered.
"The majority of the Irela supervisory board, taken into account that the question of the consequences of the programme 'Dupont Le Midi' strikes a delicate issue in familiengerechter and appropriate way would have raised."
It was therefore with no censure against his person.
The last point of contention was the statements on the earthquake in Haiti had referred.
Mr Dupont and jean-rené dufort had a medienwirksames streitgespräch delivered in this regard, that a great deal of reactions.
The choi-moderator had said, not in favour of the haiti-hilfe to have donated with security, because we do not know whether the needy also really would receive the donations.
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect of an unjustified negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I have already my three days suspendierungsstrafe abgebüßt 'in this matter.
"My acts is for one and a half years jungfräulich ', said the host.
In all decisions denounces the supervisory board the spread of a ungehobelten language.
In all cases, have the choi-fm rundfunkansager "beyond its obligations'.
The consequences for the radio stations, among other things, its decisions unique during the prime within a deadline of three days ago had to say, are slightly.

450 million in treaties without tender
In mutual agreement has hydro-québec projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the wasserkraftprojekt eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 treaties a consortium, consisting of the firms, bpr Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, that the most important proportion, namely that of projektleitung, to a sum of $295 million without invitation to tender has received.
This consortium, known as the 'énergie gérance', 2004 as a corollary of the decision of hydro-québec their responsibility, the private sector, this important, hydroelektrische project to the tune of a sum of $5 billion to future generations, is being set up.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium 'énergie gérance "the lucrative treaty, without that there had been a public invitation to tender.
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in the making.
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and refutes the competition."
'This means that instead of conventional games rather than on secret way now in an open form is carrying out', said yesterday, a Member of the PQ Sylvain simard, at the press conference.
In the early morning simard had raised the question before the French National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand him as the interest of the public in this way can be used.
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had reacted in the afternoon, by was vehemently deny that this Treaty is a stitch-up would have acted.
"I am sticking to my line," they raged by you confirmed, the PQ was "dishonest 'and' an absence of rigour '.
She said that it was the least 'that the PQ is sorry.
The model of the consortium is the world standard practice.
It is usually at a time of such temporary alliance that it two or more companies their expertise in terms of a requirement for a tender for a complex project.
The project 'eastmain' has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes.
The bauverfahren is in progress and is to be drawn up until 2012.
However, the Treaty has been missed, without that had a competition can take place; it had already negotiations.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects by no means an exception.
As the newspaper 'Le devoir' last week has pointed out, is that in the area of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium subject of regierungsermittlungen.
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows, more than 200 consortia to nominate, some of which of consistent duration appear to be.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau working in partnership with the majority of its kernkonkurrenten to which Cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin or Roche and tecsult count, together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, leads to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
What the consortium 'énergie gérance', that was Minister normandeau stresses that 'the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec this fact and that since the 1970s, in a special way, however, take into account'.
Réal laporte, the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (sebj), has made a statement, the Fed has to be on the fact that the Treaty on the projektleitung after agreement was approved.
'If you an invitation to tender power and it only a few candidates, there is your prices soar. "
"You are, therefore, two possibilities: either you nimmst the people on this Mart and you are saying: it will be a satisfactory agreement on a good price negotiate."
"the idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," reaffirmed laporte.
This the consortium 'énergie gérance' approved Treaty is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois received dollar.
The Treaties have been from either the hydro-québec or the sebj eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved for the project.
After review was the newspaper 'Le devoir "more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the companies or their branches, including in particular ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been granted.
Snc-lavalin had 22 treaties in itself, gerafft génivar had received 14 and 16, tecsult Dessau 10, without their participation in this' énergie gérance 'counting.
All these agreements have been negotiated.
They amount in the entire on 449 783 344 $, including the Treaty with "énergie gérance" on 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor) of the "Parti libéral you Québec, well known."
Minister normandeau, had the PQ is equally with the firms that they "financed ', before you specify that it is, in fact, its managers.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the 'green' label is not very heartening
Green, but clearly sceptical.
The quebecer consumer has little confidence to the key players of sustainable growth, however, nor to the marked brands or the öko-kennzeichnungen taxes, his election.
It is a pity, even though it is in a medienwirksamen universe swimming, where it of information in favour of a responsible consumption teeming: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to mourn, a shortcoming that his commitment as a brake mislead power, as the first reading was held yesterday, has shown.
Although the consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in the year 2010, seem to have promoted the quebecer, however, those who sell it to try to show little credit.
Two thirds of the quebecer population is, in fact, the environmental commitments, rather than relax them of the firms nor to believe as the Greens unternehmenswerbung, so does the responsible consumer centre of the University sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Another fact: half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the official, to the supposedly fair products annexed certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, and declare, disposing of the barometer.
According to the same pattern will the discourse of politicians on this issue of only 14.6% of quebecer population seriously.
The information concerning responsible consumption seems, however, important to stimulate this konsumsegments, currently only approximately one third of the quebecer consumers will be given.
In fact, as dampening empty and dubious character of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is after the higher price of products, the second, on the part of the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, it is a third of the quebecer of the indicated performance of green products and services which they put in hand is trying, with mistrust.
According to a other communication was already over half of the consumers in the years 2010 to change their habits and predominantly the brand of one or more products change, in order to give their conviction.
According to the barometer, they were to 61% purchases dealers and their stadtviertels prefers the purchase of food crops cultivated in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of into environmental consumption in this year had a 64 of the maximalwertes of 100 achieved - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to be king of recycling, which seeks to present his in the environment are collected traces to reduce it to the welfare of animals.
But the social and environmental awareness seems nevertheless, just before his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the quebecer have indicated, in 2010 public transport or the mitfahrzentrale used to have preferred, in order to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The walking and cycling were also of 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage supports the stereotypes.
For the takeover of excentris staatsanleihe
The quebecer government by the Société Angus and the companies parallèle was called upon to do it, funding of the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris to take part, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive borrowing.
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus parallèle, as well as the companies, which are a donation of EUR 7 million dollars by the kultusministerium for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois excentris kinokomplexes belonging to the Boulevard saint-laurent had hoped, this again to entrust its actual cineastischen function, clearly not what they have asked.
The government has accepted, in this case, however, to involve to their own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation provides the quebecer government rather a loan in less than the amount which initially hoped for a viable solution to the advantageous conditions could, at least according to the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan, as well as a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, which was once again bittgesuch since the overall downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan have already been expressed by the President of the "Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles" (sodec), François macerola, to Minister st-pierre, which the acts excentris.
A few days ago, he had her a last technical report.
The counter-proposal of cabinet was the sodec, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December, at this time to reply.
In any case, it seems that the premise of the staatsspende really to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the adoption of excentris had revolted by the argument invoked, the Culture Ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to do it not also have other cinema.
Several other market participants of the light, there, on the contrary, the substantial, economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had the eigenfinanzierten construction of the cinema over ten years the autorenkino with great difficulty in the premises of his kinokomplexes, what the unique position on the part of the public treasury.
The lack of cinema, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and excentris was aware of his clients to keep.
The Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately financed campagne, of which it is a sum 700 000 $hope for the acquisition, in order to stimulate.
Since the spring of 2009 is only one screen so that continue to show in excentris, films, namely Le parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirer is it, the three kinosäle on 27 February of next year with the demonstration of the very successful film of Xavier beauvois' of the hommes et des dieux 'new.
Christian yaccarini but has the newspaper 'Le devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the corrected downwards, we believe that the proposals you have made.
Secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new, American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians, vis-à-vis the Americans believe; they, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada open.
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters in the ballot, not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government, budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public have spread, yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome.
A of 22 September 2008 carved link, that is to say in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing, was reported on the point at which the United Nations is not more to the by their political leaders discussed operations.
The great surprise by David Wilkins, of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, used.
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation.
'A the Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex led to the Canadian, political leaders may be much more likely to on internal matters of everyday life, as the United States in this election pass the buck (as in 1988 during the campaign on the free trade), "he describes.
The United Nations, so he schlußfolgert are thus "of the proverbial Goliath this choice: omnipresent, but potentially to threatening, in order to talk about him '.
The Ambassador understands this' deafening silence 'the less, when the two countries intensive political and economic relations.
"logically," he assessed, "should it, the ability of candidates, a party and much more of a party to hold such an essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 of Terry breese, geschäftsträger in Ottawa, sent communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa.
"their journey will help, the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada to ensure its first deficit after more than a decade will be aware, the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes breese.
Nowhere, he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary sitting before Christmas must, in order to prevent the Parliament of the coalition and would throw the so conditional continuation of the opposition parties, on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms would impact.
A further, from January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins communication drafted agreed by the Washington always negative image that the anti-terror broadcast on CBC, dramatic series of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which there was little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, "or the" no-fly-list contributions for the purposes of by muskelprotze of the CIA conducted interrogations can see.
Yet another communication reported in detail on how Hillary remarked in their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner in her first bilateral meetings have asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner is the answer is' yes', but on the basis of an individual 'case to case "-entscheidung.
At the end of the meeting, àm, "he has described the Mrs a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed over, a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised that the acts once again durchzusehen."
Finally, we note that the WikiLeaks inflame passions in terms of the website.
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely on a kind of advisers, had declared that the CBC for this massive leak killed 'responsible'.
He was here to Mike Huckabee CITES from the United States.
Global plan for renewal of lighting
The UN has yesterday in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of budgets, trade and industry in 100 countries in relation to the achievement of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC's) proposed that the almost a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent of that must be implemented, in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the specific projects that the UN in Cancun hopes, in order to implement the absence of mandatory reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries.
After the expressed yesterday plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes of (GT) of the result of the lighting of the earth cast, CFCs be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) were to be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of world fleets.
In Copenhagen last year had the great abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe, and other, which was also Canada, to voluntary reduktionsplänen committed itself to ensuring that the global fckw-emissionen of 53 GT to 49 GT should face.
Of this assessment, it would, however, still 5 Gt, to withdraw from now until the year 2020 the klimaanstieg 2 degrees Celsius in order to stabilise, in order to prevent this spiral out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears built for 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced this energy demand once again in the double.
Keep the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, on average, between 6 000 by 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those of the manufacturers, Philips, this week has been put on the market - this society, incidentally, has participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, what a suggestion of the savings of the auswechselungsplanes, should be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new incandescent light bulbs only very little warmth, can you also with a regelwiderstand work.
And they do not contain any mercury.

Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria
In the space of more than six months, of July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, the in Iran for "spying" has been laid down in the French public life, left the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the thoughtful look the diplomats of the United States.
The by WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper 'Le Monde' durchgesehenen American documents some background to this crisis price.
You describe how the Elysée the Americans had declared its strategy, which, as far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of wanderern).
They show, as the French leaders have tried to convince, Washington that the liberation of young French person, not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes fugitive iraners to gegeleistung have.
After all, the way in which the French Presidency for the media to manipulate the purposes, has tried to make this the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role to play in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this respect.
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title 'Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with hostage taking. "
François richier, elysée-berater -- is maintained in the company of Patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d 'orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone.
They declared her French method.
The advised the Americans to do everything to ensure that their own nationals, the violently rückzuführen held in Iran.
"power noise ', they said,' articulated loud and clear, without letting up ', the words' grundmenschenrechte ',' innocence ',' immediate release 'in the media.
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass, the very sensitive to its image.
"policy, all the more so given that you ask the Iranians that not to do so '.
Because 'silence solves nothing', over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "masters in ausweichmanövern."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners a "normal, Iranian tactics" was: 'hostage taking for political blackmail'.
It announces the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes) 'demand the payment of a large payout to the Iranians' (230,000 Euro bail).
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage taking, a phenomenon that, "will exacerbate."
Could the Iranians' in the near future, a other of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest, living in Iran, "he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is twelve days been released from jail, will, however, continue to in Iran.
An information has been in circulation, the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran, is after decision of a judge in Paris has been released from detention.
The American Embassy is, as many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material envisaged for the nuclear programme, is the release of Majid khakavand a bad news.
France has a horse trading in?
The liberation of the iraners against the French person?
On the occasion of a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September François richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not just 'completely surprised by the decision of the judge, "but have also tried, against the authorities.
"It has a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice ' (currently given Michèle Alliot-Marie), but" the French government can do not change the judicial decision, "he says.
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand to remain under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service.
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians' is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy buildings in Paris. "
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée not spare its efforts, through statements and of the media organized "fluchtversuche" believe, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad Games a "important" and "influential role as mediator."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and conclude that the manipulation bears fruit, since several articles in the press the official French version.
A on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram rebellion evokes "the medienblitz of the French authorities'.
What is based so much "dankesbezeugung 'to Mr Assad, the Paris message.
"despite their statements give full lobpreis tacitly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea about what the syrier actually have done '.
The document also deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée this fiction to lapse.
The intensive communication efforts' aims, Sarkozy's policy of opening up towards Syria to confirm, "he analysed.
Policy, launched a 2008, the then "of numerous kritikerstimmen, in France and in the outside world as premature and unverdient was perceived '.
"The Syrian role aufbauschend 'attempts Paris" Syria, we can achieve what belobigung by a constructive role in the region'.
The aim is, moreover, "discord between Syria and Iran to sow."
The American Embassy know this from good source.
On 11 August François richier had to her, "of course we do not know whether the syrier whatever have '.
"But we have, in spite of everything, we thank you. '
"this should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians'.
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 back to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy it receives in the Elysée.
In a communiqué thanks it the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its active role in favour of the release of our fellow countryman. "
No online gambling for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean Government is a law, known as the 'that although', adopt it, which will ban the young people, after midnight online-games to play, by giving them access, as indicated in regierungsverantwortliche.
A draft law, of the online-spiele-betreiber is to invite, young people under the age of 16 after midnight access to these games, will be to deny Parliament presented in December, schilderten representatives of education and familienministerien.
"many children play these games the whole night and then have difficulties with learning in schools and also so that, during the day to lead a normal life."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary, with their health and their right to sleep to ensure ', said Mr Jo rin, with this draft law betrauter ministerialbeauftragter the French press agency Agence France press.
The online-games are then again 6 o'clock in the morning to access.
For a year the herstellergesellschaften had time to prepare for the application of the law, he has just stated.
The government also fasser, the manufacturers, to ask this every day for access to these Games time limit granted to those young people to reduce them, whose parents ask, added the person responsible.
It shall be just as those people who want it, gratisprogramme available, which will make it possible to time spent on the Internet to limit.
South Korea is one of the most mostly "networked 'countries, and newspapers reports on a regular basis by various events associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online-game-wettbewerben.
In November, South Korea to 58 further nations four gold medals won in the world cyber war games.
The FIFA World Cup 2018-2022 appoints the in:
In a state of great excitement because of corruption will appoint the Executive Committee of the FIFA World Cup on Thursday the ausrichterländer 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the rangeln for influence and the lobbying the technical criteria to press in the background.
One thing is certain: the issuing 2018 the accepted the FIFA will in Europe, of their traditional stronghold, take place (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien).
The issuing 2022 will then be something for exotic; the International Football Federation hopes, after the first on the African continent in the years 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves to win, or its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to continue to pursue.
The list of personalities, loyalty to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the level of economic and political use of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes, therefore, face up to the last minute.
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of candidates.
After the an evaluation report of FIFA, the English, offer spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will be for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees the moment of choice is not as great.
The Sunday Times, the with the achievement of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin, the only once the World Cup was allowed to thrash out, namely in 1966.
The BBC was once again the on Monday breeding ground by you own had a broadcast, of the three influential members of the kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issas hayatou under attack.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass, in the first place, with David Cameron in these last few weeks an intensive lobbying.
The head of government hopes for a relaunch of the from his predecessor, Tony Blair successful schachzuges, the London in 2005 for the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 had reached.
This intensive use would be sufficient to the image of England before the kommitee revalue again?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo spanien-portugal does not lack assets, with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its fußballkultur.
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal to the opportunities of Russia, which, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) to the weighty outsiders, increase.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided, the unumwundenen suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote 'on the part of the kommiteemitglieder condemned.
"You bewirft you with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin raged.
The United States for 2022 seem, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites.
First, the headquarters of the fifa-hauptsponsoren economic world power, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea which separately have set a very good project.
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, the competitions co-organised had in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA World Cup allocation of the long-awaited 2026 for China and the Asian opportunities on 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, that with the aufwartung futuristischer stages of all, is following the FIFA had their extension in the direction of new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (due to the zeitverschiebung), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had really clipped.
Mitterrand had believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac, not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next.
The current head of state is so candidate in the year 2012.
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums that accompanies the cannot, not good to face.
We must therefore act as if the doubt henceforth to be implemented.
In a, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that.
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in any serious tone, his decision 'at some point in the autumn of the year 2011'.
For on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern the prospect of 'two credentials' full would therefore, had a little fieberhaftigkeit widespread.
This was the official announcement of its candidacy?
Far from it.
The President has just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008 the number of the five-year terms shall confine myself to just two.
He has made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he at such meetings of the presidential election in a humorous tone mentioned.
At worst, "you have still seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: 'do not think that I do not reflecting on the period after that.'
His words of the day before yesterday not to make it more candidates than the previous day, but also no less.
They should then comment, from a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the wettlaufes at the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy are so desperate to unfold.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012, the many Members of the PS earlier than to challenge remind adopted.
The poor surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters would the rights a candidacy of François Fillon, of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the survey of the bva-l 'express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP reacted immediately and careful," the environment of the Prime Minister.
"if it is a defeat as possible, it would be not candidate ', shares Mr Raffarin with.
"It will always believe in it, able to prevail, Alain Juppé 'corrected, which deals with the offenkundigkeit has resigned.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain their acquisitions of staatspapieren
The final assembly of the Federal last year the ECB opportunities should provide an opportunity to show how we will emerge from the crisis, or at least the orders of a large number of non-conventional measures of the monetary policy, announce the end of the year will come to its conclusion.
The crisis of the European public debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can certainly cannot afford to today's, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to verwirken their worsening.
The political cost would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference the stance taken by the ECB, active role in favour of the solution of the staatshaushaltsverschuldung welcomes.
It has not dared to whether you believe, the Central Bank can do more, for example, by their programme of acquisitions of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners (...) '.
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, the previous day in Brussels, during his hearing from the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament not very redegewandt regarding its projects, but rather, to point out that the programme of the purchases of staatspapieren in secondary markets' "would be allowed to continue and that we in the House on Thursday 'will see how the decisions will be'.
Only certainty: the ECB is its main interest rate remains unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligationskäufe the schatzkammer last week by the ECB to around EUR 1,35 billion doubled.
And according to the leaks of some traders should it yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese staatspapieren have made.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases in the sum of EUR 67 billion.
Under the dealers will the anticipation of a weiterverfolgens not questioned the kaufkurses (see side 29).
The economists already not remarkable change of course expect more.
If the anleihengeschäfte of more than three months already from the arsenal of the ECB will have disappeared, will the latter still to the full geldmittelreserven freigiebige kind to make to create, and over a period of a week of up to three months.
The economists are already taken today, that this measure will extend some months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB amend its programme to essential way '.
"If not, would you take the risk of new tensions in the short term," to provoke suspected Michael schubert Commerzbank, the economist.
'a for the course of the first quarter of 2011 nominated, progressive withdrawal seems to me more likely ," anticipating them, for its part, Norbert bräms, economist in sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions in the market of the national debt "the ECB should such a kaufvolumen aufrechthalten in bonds, that the sluggish market stimulates', adds Norbert bräms.
In view of the relevance of the vulnerable position of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no other choice but to maintain their presence on the market.
"You must at any price to the steller the lack of investors on the market and so act to the premature nature of enthusiasm about the to the weakest States paid to prevent returns," an important obligationeninhaber bezeugte yesterday.
Because if interest rates on the boom, would even more from the States, to reduce their debt, or even just to stabilise.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is in Italy in cover
After a for Italy worrying of the week, the situation has yesterday with the decline in the eckzinsen a little to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti the situation as' and 'unentzifferbar qualify him with a' unvorhersagbaren "weekend will have to hear what the person concerned was denied by immediately, however.
On Tuesday, in any case, would have the gap with the German interest rates achieved its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the Treaties to cover the konkursrisikos points are to 263, what a certain kopflosigkeit generated in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had in its Council of Ministers pointed out, that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates in 400 basis points.
His right hand, MEP, Mr Letta, was, however, difficult as' concerned 'of the' market turbulence 'and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
'The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, not as Greece or Ireland. "
"The bad news is that Italy, as Portugal is," declared stelzer Irwin, economist on the Hudson institutes.
In plain language, the heisst his problem is the absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, which the state in danger, its financing needs no longer able to meet.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and of 1.4% in 2012... although expected from the Senate is examining the budget with 1.3% and 2% is calculated.
Under these conditions, the European Commission will be calculated, next year's budget deficit still 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the predicted by the governments 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
That is why the turmoil at a new haushaltskollektiv, that after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used.
"if necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says Auditors Olli Rehn.
Italy to hour receives the support of international institutions.
'undermines the very foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, repeat that we already have for a long time, "assured arrigo sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is entrusted with Italy.
"at the moment there is no problems, not on short-term, still on long-term view, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in the year 2011, other things that R.) will be asked for lower stabilisationsfortschritte than of other countries', observed Pier Carlo padoan, chef-volkswirt of the OECD.
There remains the question of the political unstetigkeit.
On 14 December will be Silvio Berlusconi, a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, face as a result of which the preferred elections at the end of March could be organised.
It is therefore a little favourable period, for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans thinking on the strengthening of the antikrisenmaßnahmen after
Christine Lagarde, it had even yesterday in a press conference in Paris explicitly stated: "I believe that it is still on Sunday afternoon, and also in the evening, clearly demonstrated: the Europeans keep together, are ready and committed, their currency and to defend its currency area '.
Although completely relatively - the yesterday, withdrawal in the zinsfüßen the European staatsobligationen was grist to the mill of the governments and of the ECB.
From a normalisierungsbeginn can, however, not yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could the schuldenvermerk Portugal, perhaps the most effective target of the speculators, lower today.
"as in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems rests," the opinion of the economists of the exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially as' the political time passes much more slowly than the of the markets'.
The European countries, both this gap and the risk that it is hidden, intensify, are well aware of the discussions on the strengthening of the already existing antikrisenmaßnahmen.
The informal discussions between the closest affected Finance Ministers and in the broader context, with their opposite numbers of the G20 is progressing well.
And this also in regard to the meetings of eurogroupe and ECOFIN at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is today.
In the plan is the lot of non-conventional measures to save the countries of the euro area in the bulls eye of the markets (see below).
What the eu-stabilitätsfonds is concerned, it has its executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in singapour his asien-tour started the investors in the Far East on the developments with regard to the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit not express fundraising, he is certainly this to the ground.
The first werpapierausgaben from the eu-stabilitätsfonds are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the agency Reuters entrusted to the United States supported a possible increase in the by the additional, direct commitment of the IMF mobilized fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, send, for their part, structural reforms, particularly in the area of arbeitsmarktorganisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures, however, show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid, a different approach, as this Greece and Ireland have done.
Both, and the other is at any price, to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they set their own budgetkorrektive and on essential structural reforms, which you have decided, in the long term, the confidence again.
The European investors, in their turn, have been on the options available to the normalisation process to speed up the markets of government bonds.
President Axel Weber, on 24 November in Paris in transit, was produced as a first had the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion euros were not enough, the Union would not hesitate, once again into their own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, in terms of the market of the European public debt in the forefront of related player, judgments, an extension of the EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct massive injection of liquidity.
This means exist: the European mechanism dotierter finanzstabilisierung currently is EUR 60 billion.
An advisory committee, all the opportunities, closely in the European capitals examining.
Above all, if the market conditions worse.

Métro grand Paris: first financial tantalizing glimpses of Europe
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the underground grand Paris in memory, the of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built.
The baubeginn the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of EUR 4 billion has been declared.
In the theoretical scheme of this is the sum of the SGP then, on the markets would allow a part of the finanzsumme to their dual.
Today it is, after all, to first projections.
The amending budget by 2010, this morning by the finanzkommission looked through the national assembly, contains the measures provided for in the first part of this money.
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax on erschließund and higher taxation of the offices at the ile-de France.
The former, Article 15 of the draft law funding, is "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
This is quantified: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year '.
Zweitere is a reorganisation of the already existing taxation: "in order to modernise the from their educational product and to increase this increase in the Société du Grand Paris to entrust."
How much would tabling?
A puzzle.
This amount is not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is a long way away.
'It is stated that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the kapitaldotation be added, which will be found by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to and after for the project to be done', as is clear from the explanatory statement.
In the SGP will take place this system is not offensive.
"since the moment in which the income has been recorded (the two taxes, that R.), the studies on three years and then cover only from the 4 billion, 'it will draw.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started, the 4 billion for the budget 2014 to note.
This measure, whose 4 promised billion we will be able to seek, is in danger of a right, parliamentary discussion.
The first public sitting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The affaire Wikileaks has a twofold importance.
On one side, it has than obvious scandal arrangement, a scandal, the only a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is the beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press governed.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives us a taste of the future dominated by recession.
Let us get things in the right.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service drafted acts (a mere nation) exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's are nothing more than what you in any case for months in any old Journal was to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi " s kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time for their sketche substance.
The rule that the secret dossiers only from already known news consist, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only this century.
If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will recognise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeated what was written already in previous works.
This does not only, therefore, that the author occult texts to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he does not know where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who devote the okkultismus, to nothing other than the to believe what you already know and confirmed what you have already learned.
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown.
Just as the secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise what it could be, for example, editor in Libération), the only true considers what he recognises.
The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat had sent, were the same as those who already Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier?
On one side is this what any educated person already know, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or a plane, to the dinner to meeting - have lost their diplomatic role, and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren.
Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact, to repeat it publicly violates the task of the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, brings with it the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats.
In addition, the scandal less the victims, rather than the 'Executioner' is in trouble.
But we have the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, to Orwell's time, it was all power as a big brother, the every gesture of his subjects controlled.
Orwell's prediction would have since then as absolutely right can highlight, where every movement thanks to the telephone calls can monitor any made transaction, the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens to the total victims would the eye of power.
But if we, bearing in mind what is happening today, that even the secret krypten the power not more of the control of a hackers can escape the kontrollgang, it is said to be directed at, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig.
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as vindicator of the citizen - can the secrets of power in experience.
How can but a power that are no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets?
It is true, Mr simmel has already said that a real secret an empty secret is (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, since it surrenders the public sphere; but, in the manner of WikiLeaks be disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power.
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy still Merkel wrong, against it but Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done?
It is obvious that the States in future no reserved more online information - that would be a in the street corner angeklebten aushang.
But it is equally obvious that it with the current technologies in vain hope is, confidential reports on telephone able to keep secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State in a plane moved and one of his colleagues has contacted.
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relations are?
I know very well that my forecast in the moment following science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I am forced, me to present the regierungsagenten on secret way digging away to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications than anywhere else in the mere memories tragend with it, and, moreover, the few written information, they have achieved, in the schuhabsatz verbergend.
The information would be in one single copy in closed cannot be stored: in fact, had the spionageversuch of Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer is moving ahead, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized the communications, the Internet a telegrafen reconstructed with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) videokassetten had the filmforschern possible, a film bond for bond auszukundschaften by from behind forward spulen and all the secrets of installation was able to reveal, while the (numerical) CDS nowadays, nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen so.
With the high-speed trains, one in three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by air, including of switching three and a half hours requires.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communications technology on car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the messages that confidential information from the press.
Climate such as France his finanzversprechen amount:
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to compliance with the quickly resolved financing pledge (also 'almost start' or premature financing mentioned) to investigate the of the developing countries have been realised.
And are already the gross French vulnerable to blandishments exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion promised (that is to say EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 has the EU all its partners of the fact of their commitments regarding the fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference, great nebenevents, broschürenverteilung.
The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of their actual value estimated: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau.
The EU, announced in the years 2010 to have released EUR 2.2 billion, what they are on the right road to respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new" and, in addition, in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without, at the expense of public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what 'new and additional' means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, have certain Member States, including France, the procedure is being blocked.
Today everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers as best.
The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009: the international financing, for their attacks are maintained, and is within the framework of funding 'fast-start "150 million over three years.
Other countries have similar indicative values, either as regards year or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid.
On the other hand, France was of the opinion that the financing 'of all new projects' of the year 2010 "are new, and in addition '.
In other words, there is no indicative values in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of the French support of the developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France is, his commitment to the "new and additional 'funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus.
Some, such as, for example, France, are 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to 1 donated €.
This is apparently only difficult acceptable that the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects to be based actually technology) cannot be justified, it is illusory to present the euro, known as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... should also only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland as a commitment to be counted (that is the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France has nothing else in the sense as the following consideration: it 'respect' his commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5% loans (389,8 million euro) and 8.5% donates) 36,1 million euro) - see the EU documents, in order to convince themselves.
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent.
Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of European Union 1 €to fulfil their obligations, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable efforts.
Fine hocus-pocus!
All in all, France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud: a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time, and, on the other part with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manage it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promise has spent, and it saves it 36,1 million euro.
The manipulation of the Finance Ministry (as it appears that it was Bercy, of the arbitrage has carried out a double) could lead to negative effect; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations, but if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not completely misled...
The chapter of the premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate.
But it could the drop of too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As it always was, it is essential to its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn.
First and foremost, France could a change in its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for its commitments and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward (another, decisive and now discussed subject): you can escape the question of the 'verrechenbarkeit' or the verbuchungsart its loans not.
France could change its position as progressive as regards the issues to be, as it is for other things.
The hope is based, therefore, on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancun will arrive.
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit ', and of the use of loans would the international nature, to raise the necessary basis for further discussions.
The alarm - of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years adopted on the day 81 various chemical substances, so a this Wednesday from the Association of générations futures (former movement for the protection of human rights and the respect of future generations) study published.
The association, the stated that its results', given the small number of analyzed samples no statistically significant value, but illustrationscharakter constitute the issue ', between July and September the usually within four, of a ten-year-old child around to the meals food consumed plus a zwischenmahlzeit in supermarkets in oise bought and Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and obstteilen, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were just as naschereien of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The tellerbilanz is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five that prove to be safe, as well as klassifizierte karziogen 37 substances with endokrinin-störfaktor, according to studies of various institutions, such as the international cancer research centre.
"even if in the virtually all the cases the legal limits for each chemical substance, individually adopted are not exceeded, as funding of this survey but it is very good that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances with endokrinin-störfaktor is suspended, is worrying ', says the unification.
The breakfast alone already contain the butter and the tea with milk already more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three sure as carcinogenic proven, as well as more than twenty residues, which can affect the hormonal systems.
The from Brazil imported apple as zwischenmahlzeit envisaged for the study, is showing traces of six chemical substances, including a in France distinguish fungicide.
The same applies to the Greens beans from Kenya, including in the lunch, in which the study traces of a in the EU strictly banned insektizids has said.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the Pandora, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap the analyses have the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At the dinner was the lachssteak with 34 identified, chemical residues on "richest ', and even of the articulated lorries of meal used in the microwave plastikteller was not unencumbered.
The schlußendliche risk this "schadstoffcocktails' for the consumers' will probably undervalued," the study.
The "Alliance Europe ecologie-les Verts' (ee-lv) has, for its part," in view of the urgency of the situation 'proposed that a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to introduce the' increase in diseases of civilisation to stop '.
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues 365 of different, in fruit and vegetables identified pesticides identified which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in getreiden.
