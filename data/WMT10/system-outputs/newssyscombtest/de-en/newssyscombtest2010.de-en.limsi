Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose Piste+s Sorgenn make not only the Riesengebirgen Anwohnern.
The lack of snow discourages people of appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It can therefore in giant gebirge+s still free rooms for all Wintertermine incl. the Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our sides visited often.
The offers by the people, the prices firm, but now they have fear, binding.
And if they call us immediately, ask whether, in our view, this year's Christmas on snow or "to Matsch" will be the operator of the Informationsportals Spindl. INFO, Martin Jandura.
Those who stay in the New spindel mill just after his ideas like that should no longer hesitate with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers the savings and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days ago.
The Spindelmühle Hotelbesitzer now offer for the Silvestertag mostly only Wochenaufenthalte.
I think that they are still a long time, sell it, but then they yield, and for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms quickly dwindling, Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates still always offers the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our supply about half of the seats are still free.
That is why even some cheaper Christmas functions include preparing for the last moment, the director of the travel office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant Reisebüro Vrchlabi can also offer yet, but there is a less free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest will be sold Wintertermine on average.
This year the interest for the winter visits by negative influences that Giant always no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to be the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the Piste+s within a week of snow, will also be sold out the Christmas Schiefert says.
On the other hand, and a little better than in the last year, manages the rooms in the hotel in Pecpod Snezkou horizon.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On Silvestertag and Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in the Janua, and in February, the business also are going well, wrote to the director of the best Pec Hotels, Karel Rada.
But 80 percent of the Silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel Omnia in central parking lot in Janske Lazne occupied.
There is to be Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half of the beds free.
No fun having surprised us the January this year, for which we are currently have around 60 percent occupied.
A bit is weaker now, but the February in the moment when the snow comes, certain the interest in the residential Giant, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a more snow bescherung are the riesengebirge hotelbesitzer now.
On Thursday, it was cool and if it rains, the snow on the mountains.
But then again, to a warming told Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech weather bureau in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation as the most subtle, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue repeated that he was even for the most stupid thing.
When he finally his anxiously awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it was that those on the copying paper from the Bush Iraq abschrieb Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only is it several times in the text itself, the saying goes, "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of one statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new Vorwärtsweg 'is used, without the fence.
He has three years of the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the ravaged by the civil war in Iraq as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions the Karas trophische decision".
This showed the following months, however, that the Bush strategy based on the recommendations of the military, the only possible and insofar as very successful, that it is now in the news about Iraq no longer has any.
The image Bush has not improved since objective, he has his successor a much dankbarere starting position left behind, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama, hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have asked him again to the military, particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal who, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten the zaudernd let in the White House is hard.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but with no better idea and he has the General wenistens cheated about 10,000 soldiers.
For Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000, even if he forced at least 10,000 did originally.
The most problematic in the Obama strategy is his plan, the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process to withdraw within three years to complete the entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some who doubt that the halved increase the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society relatively well structured, their leaders pay homage to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraband indikation - it can rely on no one and there will be no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were founded formally correct, that leaves only bogus construction, behind which the patriarchal Stammbeziehungen will make further out.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the situation, which the Pakistan and Iran Einflüsse even more complex.
Even the builds a 'strong state', which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan only worse and now it is on the brink of explosion.
We believe that the small soldiers in the war cries on "early heimkehr", here is a miracle, can only create a real romantic soul, which is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, the release date for the troop withdrawal pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban, as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans, to the fighting in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians and their constituents do not want to explain how the security of Germany or Italy with the war in Hindukusch Gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem to be solved not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama to the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also have a dramatic twist of the Afghan situation.
The only sop for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and therefore, there is still enough time for it to be a different strategy fallls can use this as a total failure would prove to be.

I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs, the target of criticism after it for the first three quarters of this year, nearly 17 billion dollars set aside for premium bonuses.
The total amount of the premium bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency probably also, despite the right action today exceed 20 billion dollars.

Britain said on Wednesday that it intends to present the bonuses of bankers who exceed 25,000 pounds, unique with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar moves are also preparing for France.

Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the castle
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning at the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, who is staying on in the government because he thought with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form in which this through the Assembly on Wednesday was released, does not agree.
It was accepted that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota the cabinet in the issues of the Freitagstreffens.
The budget is also of Klaus criticized.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in public finances.
The meeting involved the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Over its future remain in his post will Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
The budget bill, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the Linkspartei Vorschläge passing on money and the money for the Staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of social benefits and Direktlöhne of farmers.
The government of the proposals of the Social Democrats has been that they concealed the budget deficit.
The Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a strong domestic political dispute has arisen dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the Fisher Beamtenkabinetts, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics say that the budget as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures, which virtually wiped out by the specific government have been imposed in the autumn, and for her understanding to put an end to the national debt.
Klaus, who is the law on the state budget, but not to sign, said today in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances have neglected, a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only a strong government, which is still on a broader consensus of the political parties could build.
The ODS Vorsitzender, Mirek Topolanek, led that the budget is terrible, and the government should give their continued existence.
The ODS Stellvorsitzende, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer said in the editorial similar words as a "strong worry."
The cssd chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek Worte that the budget deficit horrific is that the previous government of Topolanek for this year, and which had prepared 200 billion kronor.

Mandela was in the new film by Clint East wood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans, argue that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene 'of the world, much of the country shows of the fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role of an American actor.
The story tells of sport, Rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid rule system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his history of the American oscar# schauspieler, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that the 21 90 year Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood film.
A more meaningful role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "if I were you, I need to play.
The young 70-year actor, which is the price for his role in the Eastwood drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" was already had received the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which, finally, to slave owner, is a fictional US President, and God in "Evan Allmächtig" but seldom someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which has been published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film sets out a true story, in which Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, came together to agree to the country. the new President Mandela knows that his people even after apartheid still race remains divided and in economic terms.
He believes that his people by the sport can agree, therefore, he decides the rugby players in the world, the outsiders are to reach an agreement.
Finally, the South African team to the World of 1995.
Freeman worked several years at the mandela# story on the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role these as close as possible to move closer to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said, if he and the world leader would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, with him to eat at night and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important was for him, Mandela to shake hands.
I noticed when I give you the hand schüttele, I will take your energy, it is, and I had the feeling that I know what they are, he said.
It is important to me a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film, Francois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months for the role in the crackdown to prepare for the rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he Pienaar met for the first time in his home.
I remember when I was in the Türklingel rang that he opened up and the first thing I in my life to Francois Pienaar said, was: 'in the film, I see a lot more from'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with its real role models, he has led the director East wood "Invictus: ungeschlagen" positive reviews, and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic for the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "that was very good, very good terrorism film."
In the film rezension on the Web-Seite+s rottentomatoes Invictus, has 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secrecy on Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a missile
In addition to Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested.
The launch was again not successful and the type of "Bulava" missile, which was the pride of the Russian army, will slow the nightmare of the Russian generals and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or were damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers is already on "Bulava" as a "missile, which flies."
A missile, which flies, but is not
This is already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third rocket stages.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp allows the firing from the submarine.
It is likely that the indefinite flying object caused by a mysterious light on northern waterway actually damaged "Bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians, for the first time not doubt that a Russian rocket.
The generals, diesesmal challenged and claims that it is not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell, and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the same engines in the first stage.
Although no test start without mistakes, is still in charge of the Ministry of Defence, only six of 13 for unsuccessful.
The nearly 50% success, therefore, the generals met with optimism and so will continue to be claimed that the "Bulava" even without problems will fly and even to ten Hyperschall Atomsprengköpfe with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.

Czech discovery: a substance that also tempered like steel as a basic HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientist testing new compounds that the spread of HIV virus in the body to stop.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that, at the time of the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the disadvantage is that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS could not be cured.
The patients, the drug combination but prolong the lives and the reproduction of HIV viruses in the body.
Your income, but of a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the viral reproduction, also has the development. Resistentviren sg, against the no medicines more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (chemical and technological university) Prague and the university in Heidelberg opens the way how to deal with the viral resistance.
You have proven that as Metalokarborane 'substances on the protein material, which for reproduction of the HIV Viruses is responsible.
The Metalokarborane are links of Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links are undermining the viral reproduction, in a different way than medicines, used all today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists to new counter-revolution, improved basic links on the basis of understanding of the molecular mechanism linking it to the Viren Eiweißstoff were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor, hydrogen technology and Kohlenstoff Atomen and through a metal Euratom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Being in the home and constant virus
HIV Protease is protein material of the HIV virus, which for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without that caused by the HIV Protease HIV virus fission would not be ready Infektionsvirenpartikel.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call in the propagation of the virus in a patient's body, say the scientists in the press report by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work in the Science paper was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the researchers describe a series of compounds, in which two couples of the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then continues systematically.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against HIV Protease wurdne in test tubes, also tested against their stable (resistant) variants of HIV infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane on the usual enzym# variants is not as strong as in the clinical use of pharmaceuticals, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique operating mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and other chemical Gestaltung+s, makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further to the development of effective drugs against HIV, directed research, says Rezacova Pavlina, head of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Because of budget dispute. ODS has referred to Fischer, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year as "horrific" and the government of Premier of Jan Fischer should, in his view, their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS called the prime minister as a "strong worry."
It is alleged time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS Vorsitzender, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to take in Parliament on the minority of Europe when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be to remain in office through the Parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is completely different, and Necas pointed out.
The Parliament on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with Linkpartei adopted Änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
The Parliament has the money for Staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the social democracy that they concealed the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, it is the wish of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the Budgetprovisoriums Frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, about his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government will assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota serious with his resignation in the event that would have threatened the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has also indicated that he is to remain in office.
Reason to do so is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent is Fischer for further fight with the budget deficit, so that, pursuant to the Nominanten Necas of Social Democrats (CSSD), which won the changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The premier also should make it clear that he will resign if the House adopts deficit steigernde laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the services novelle legislation.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
That is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS nominated ministers have made no mistakes, Topolanek said in a text from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function, which is folk to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas said that if Fischer in favour decides on the fight against the level of deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority in Parliament, which at the moment."
He then allegedly with the support and approval of the Civil Democratic Party does not.
I have not thought about it, and if the current, then I am going to deal with it, said the of the Civil Democratic Party nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak the journalist in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer was flying in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas said at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the amended budget if the premier Members Democratic Party would explicitly ask that the adoption of the budget.
We will not be an orphaned children, we are not small children, as he responded to the question of whether the ODS in political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament, and in the Czech Republic has been pushed back.
I did not notice that my voice.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, division of the Parliament and the destruction of all would be positive, Topolanek itself.

It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening the railway elektrifizierung from Lysa nad Labem after milo vice is possible.
The distance long routes in the capital of Prague in the station, the main depot.
The CD is more links between Prague and Ostrava SC Pendolino trains after Sumperk and Jesenik in space (from two hours to drive.
With the Pendolino, the passengers since 13 December no longer travel to Bratislava.
In this years old bill for regional rail: increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are appointed and paid by the Transport Ministry, received the railways to foot the so-called Liquiditätsverlusts in the next year four billion kronor, genaus as this year. the Lokalzug supply the districts, in general, they have to pay for that in the next year, to eight billion kronor, while the state indemnifying three billion.
This year, the Regionalzug+s 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the Lokalzug and the rapid trains, the railways a ten-year contract new completed the Treaty has, until now, only for a year ago.
The railways praises the system, perhaps, it has also not to increase in the price of the great majority of tickets.
Among changes, it is only in one-day network driving banknotes CD Net and low-cost Internet driving banknotes eLiska.
For passengers without the debit card will be the price CD Net of 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price eLiska will depend on the tracks are, by now, he was on the trip between any Bezirkstädten uniform and cost 160 kronor.

The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura today, charged in criminal proceedings for libel against three social democratic leaders.
Hasek from the district against Michal Südmähre, Ratko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district, Martin Tesarik Olomouc.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute interest view in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the efforts of the company, the regional zugverkehr in some districts.
All regions, but in the end the long-term contracts with the Czech railways signed.
All three heads are to us and say that we pick the cherries, we have the supply only about the size, as it was voted on with them.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech railways, because we know the price of the Czech railways were completed last week.
So we have no other option but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the society Jancura student Agency, said the radio journal.
At the same time he gave was that he has evidence from all the districts that they get their act in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against Pneumokokken from January the Gewohnte change.
It is a first for the families free and voluntary.
But now the floor votes that mandatory vaccinations would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The drug Institute is already implementing the maximum prices of vaccines, health insurance companies have to pay for it.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August Kinder
From January children can be vaccinated for free against Pneumokokken, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they disturb a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has been with the vaccination in the last year or earlier has begun, must also pay continue to repeat vaccination itself.
The first dose of vaccine is between 3 and 5 month of life of the child.
Last year alone, a quarter of the families had their children inoculated against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses.
All in all, the experts that the health insurance for the vaccination doses of 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
You save, but in the treatment of children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state on all land vaccination of children spent around 500, 000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections, including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen under investigation for us to die in hospitals each year up to 28 children under the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination duty.
At the same time, said that this vaccine could be future duty.
From January to this by insurance paid and voluntary.
The fact that the mandatory vaccinations would be better off, said, for example, the head of the Civic Association, Rudolf Kalovsky Nahlas.
His association, already long-term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the International Conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have, at least.
I believe that this is the road which we now have to go, Kalovsky.
The health ministry wants but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken cannot change.
In this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say the doctors.
The chairman of the professional society of practical children's doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, that there is a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all the children were vaccinated, it could be on the reduction of the repeat vaccination number "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination as a voluntary was launched," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents their infants against Pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is also groundbreaking, that this was the first to land vaccination of the health insurance paid for and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so as to save them for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical children's doctors, who linked the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project the vaccines should be available by the insurance companies and doctors this on the same road, as well as other vaccines by the state to spend it.
Some Members who felt that the insurance as "the money from the health insurance could lead."
Therefore, the doctors the vaccines even shopping, and wait for the insurance companies to pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners have to invest 40 000 koruna per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
And still they
Can the Islam French.
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on building for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar, a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims in one of the most avowedly secularise their own societies in Europe can be integrated and integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the work of the author: "why the French no headscarves love" (original titles: "Why the French Don t Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierend study of a contentious issue, which the country about one and a half decades and was announced and whose impact is still to play.
Bowens new book offers a broader and more kühn# spectrum.
As good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening on the field.
He has months in mosques, schools and institutes, who are now 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic space".
He is a good listener, he is debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
If a Muslim in a mosque or a town hall marriage (or both).
If young Muslims about evolution and the rights of homosexuals to be lectured.
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man.
Is it permissible for a Muslim, a zinsorientiertes banking system to use to get a mortgage.
It is these seemingly down-to-earth Affairs, he claims, which daily life, in contrast to the political drama, what the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, born in Switzerland of Arab Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You do not have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who asked Bowen are usually at odds with their Salafi Gegenstücken rightly advocates of Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia in the now a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
It is, to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, which is so passionate the separation of church and state watches) really are committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rauere treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who know their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism had to make.
It recognises an "intensification of the value schrauben+s" as a growing pragmatism.
Can the Islam French. after reading this book, it is tempting to say 'yes, but not yet. "

The specific charges have not yet been published under Cuban law, although a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor for almost anything, on charges of "endangering" can be arrested.
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrests.
Anti-government graffiti and statements will be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, which, by the popular Reporterin Yoani Sánchez, which often describes how she and her husband persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sanchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country, with prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably be the tension between the Communist government of Castro Bruders in Cuba and the Obama government which, a "slow" approach to the improvement of relations with the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was first Friday eight of the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for opposition.

Pakistani officials plan to meet to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered an alleged mastermind of a conspiracy aimed at five men from North virginia to Afghanistan in order to send US troops to kill, and said that they hope this case could help in a huge network of terrorist Anwerber+s uncover the Internet search after radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they have a shadowy insurgents, known as Saifullah, had been seeking, which invited the men to Pakistan after he was identified as one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments had made to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah, after their arrival in Pakistan, the leader of these men and tried to help them, the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who have been briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, the Al Qaeda leaders Saifullah was not convinced that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the officials who, because of the sensitivity of the issue, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and to continue trying to get the right recommendations for access to the Al Qaeda camps, as the Pakistani law enforcement authorities have been arrested.
The case of the five men, who still are in Pakistan and will be interviewed by the FBI, underlines the vital role of the Anwerber+s to identify future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in the decision on who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, it was a matter of the utmost urgency, human assets within Al Qaeda.
The Anwerber+s of the organisation act as guardians who do not accept those whose commitment to the holy war is not serious enough and such, the spies could be.
American Möchtegern be Rekruten A Qaeda a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US Zielen and their Propagandawertes will it as extremely attractive for the group.
Evan coal countryman, ranking the highest analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said terrorist groups in recent years were much more cautious about whom they become access because the US secret services are experts in their Rekrutierungsmethoden.
If you are trying to infiltrate these groups, anyone, what better way than you could go to the recruiting model to follow, which so many have already followed, said coal man.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action '
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the city Kongresszentrum Bella more kühn# action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimate that more of about 25,000.
The event is relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists small explosives in the vicinity of some government buildings in the city centre zündete.
On a day when the United Nations-sponsored climate negotiations little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, where in English, "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared that "the world is saying 'enough is enough."
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native country of their mother, their awareness of the heart-rending problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration to pass on the floor and to world leaders to call a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but they must be taken now and there is no way out, which leads.
The police kept the demonstrators away, close to the bella# centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either mitführten masked or pocket cutters.
According to Danish law, these actions in demonstrations were banned.
According to a viewer, who do not wish to be named because he is involved in the negotiations on climate change, masked demonstrators burned in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen Hauptkanals, near where several ministries.
They threw it in the vicinity of the buildings, he said and added that it began as a flashing missiles, but "a couple of large explosions" were followed.
Inside the conference centre, the people on television screens throughout the afternoon, the demonstration.
But the protest, the awareness of the Hauptfunktionäre as Su as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.

It then continues in Mandarin and said: "because the venue is big, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He said that from the perspective of the individual is on whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that the negotiations or the freedom of other people upset."
Audit data show persistent racial gap
The certificates to mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, DC
Although the District of Washington still far behind the schools of the country, the maximum benefits, the records show that the Viert and Achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what, in the latest figures from the national assessment of educational progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students at both local and national level.
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington, D.C., in the last two years by 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which its African-American other children, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture of a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the score, the children of both groups have grown in that time, the difference with 58 points now scarcely decreased.
Some education supporters of the district last week expressed its concern that the results of school kanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty has been celebrated for the most part of white students, who are already strong children.
This suggests that the overall wertung by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale have increased, as problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the D.C. Voice, a non-profit group which, for the educational opportunities in Washington D. C..
I springe not for a period of two or three points, and, said the democratic Washington city council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of grundschule right.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the audit point figure, is that the middle schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course we would like to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But I am upset about is that we are not nearly the time and energy, which we use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to address the needs of the current weak pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers trained a new reading curriculum, the wilson# reading system, to students in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading not the beginning of their school careers have mastered and which significantly behind their peer groups class companion.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum from kindergarten to sixth league games and living in the real experience, was the former chief school inspector Clifford Janey to Washington this curriculum, and some of the NAEP Fortschritte, which were reported last week.
I think that we still have to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit from the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP Ergebnisse highlight the question of whether Rhee can proceed with the overall performance of the system and continue to improve the additional money and resources for the current weak schools can provide needed in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional cure is its resources and management reforms in the schools, who in the poorest areas of Washington, D. C..
The objective could be political fallout that against this important work.
The weak point is, of course, as in other urban school inspectors that they are trying to white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we have a system of great schools.
We must make our schools in the urban areas, so that all families, regardless of where they live, to be sure that their children received a good public school education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is the traditional public school year, which is currently in Washington to extend 180 days, in order to compete with the charter schools.
It must be the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey who, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.

"yes, I will be here soon!" cried Graciela who wish to study medicine, as the leader, announced that they are entering the building for natural sciences.
"wow," 'said they really thought, as the low Professor to Studenten relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7, which the children to their three-day tour and now they have visited the intended message full inclusion: the question is not whether we have at college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States Hispanic immigrants, the high school is not an end, or as a teenager become pregnant, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of what the college education, which is needed in the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the College, from which it is a remarkable achievement, given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the United States, without the high school to have concluded.
Your success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which is a huge role in the workforce of the country will play, the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent impetus to success.
Many of them have parents that their children and to find ways to their lack of familiarity with American schools.
However, advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children in college as they help to come, especially if these efforts over a long period of time.
If low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills in the Wegsuche them through the system, it will be to help a single measure to any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We have to think about it, for these children a support network of the nursery school and through high school.
The federal program that Gracielas college tour sponsored, is a useful example.
It is known as the GEAR UP - one place higher do - and more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems available to college preparatory programs begin to launch, if low-income students in the middle school, and to run until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program since 1999, more than 10 million pupils, of whom more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can get to rebuild its infrastructure damaged.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi oil ministry, suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry to play that for decades by war and economic sanctions is paralysed.
American companies only shares in two of the 10 auctioned in certain fields.
Seven American companies have had to take part in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a priority, the lost.
Two American companies have been able to fields auctioned off contracts concluded in June.
The thin on representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry analysts by surprise.
Iraq has finally after six years of war, opened its doors and instead of US companies give the way Asian and European Ruba Husari, said, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability was underlined by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably held told analysts to engage more in Iraq, which is the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, significantly lower wage costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to sign contracts with the ministry.
Major US companies, such as forcing Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian companies, Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and was able to contracts with major packages for two more fields to go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big countries of the world economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbieter can be measured and its commitments towards Iraq will meet.
For the gebot# levy advance gewählte company gave instructions, which then, with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was prepared to pay the emission of each area, about the current level.
Top designer of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US anti-missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week to a top Einsatzplaner of Al Qaeda, have been killed, representatives of the US Terrorismusbekämpfung reported on Friday.
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al Somalis was one of the two Arabs, in accordance with United States sources and Pakistani authorities in the region of a number of missiles, which are to be killed on Tuesday, her car near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
You went on to say in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said an official representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local residents, who are suspected to belong to the militants, ran to the stage and were soon everything, which completely destroyed by the "bodies" remaining.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US Terrorismusbekämpfung unspecified evidence that led to the deaths of Somalis.
Somalis, as a leading military planners of the Al Qaeda terrorist groups, described the operations outside the region led Pakistan to Afghanistan.
He was in plots throughout the world, said a senior official who wished to remain anonymous, and to the sensitive nature of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one adopts its central role as a given, this also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took up strategic instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second US official representative said that Somalis quickly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy is attained and best links to other extremist groups used in the region.
He may not be familiar to some Americans, said the second official representatives, but this in no way reduced the threat he was, for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be the second leading Somalis Al Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September, as in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other Topaktivisten were killed.
The pace of attacks by unmanned air vehicles of the CIA, since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of a charitable organisation website maintained by an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline has improved tactics of terrorist groups, the steps to reduce their vulnerability and, at the same time, the suspected informants brutal killing, was reported to the side.
Top UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The top UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, which would put an end to a stormy tenure by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Oath departure, as the Obama further has decided to send 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he expressed his concerns about the US Zeitplan for the military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, other NATO Regierungen may prompt to withdraw its armed forces.
We need to speed up construction of the Afghan security forces and that the right message to the Afghans that they send to the international community can trust, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, the number of international civilian aid workers, to increase in the political transition for Afghanistan to help.
The troop increase on the military side must increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he does not resign his office, but only one in March 2008 for his family to grant agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said he wanted the notification to UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he had time for a replacement.
What I have said, is that it is better to find a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, according to UN officials with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish Italian stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, which should have led earlier took into consideration.
Oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith had charged him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country to theory and evidence of massive electoral fraud to cover.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "of the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election was".
Eide said that it was the appointment of a senior civilian representative has recommended to the aid of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He entered the fact that the UN leadership of his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries wishing to donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is used wisely.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the reduction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN Einstellungsregelungen have undermined its ability to bring in, capable people.
The UN Regeln are so complex that since May, he said, only one person has been able to stop.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran, with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the powers of the world will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because it does not apply to talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7 tägigen journey through the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of around 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the things I to the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama government prefers a sanctions package in recital, based on the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some of the sanctions also could affect the average iraner.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed, "the Iranian government to convince with nuclear weapons in fact less protected," because "their people are suffering tremendously" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders joined in the warning that Iran, with "credible" consequences if he has to deal with its nuclear programme to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of the nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, said Iran that he talks to curb its nuclear program would resume and a substantial part of its storage of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor would give up.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran, however, since this time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran the international community about some of the proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, simply has left standing, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way, as they put it in combination with important additional sanctions on Iran have never been, said Gates.
President Obama has 31 Dez. as a deadline set for Iran to respond to these proposals other options before it, including the foreign minister, Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "the crippling sanctions.
In New York, in a statement, the Iranian representative at the United Nations, on Thursday condemned what it "baseless and unfounded allegations" of certain members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities called and said that they are willing to talk with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to reach a long-term solution."
Gates, who last Friday after Washington should return in the morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before it in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meeting with the troops in Kirkuk and the Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays of US plans, the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried, the Kurdish concerns about the upcoming withdrawal of troops. the US representatives quoted Gates to Masood Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "we will your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda hoardings lecture on which they felt that "mother earth is too tired to have more children," and "a baby more means a grave."
These lessons they have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "in no case."
We already have all of our time and energy to invest in a child.
For a second child is no longer other, said Wang, 31, a human head with an 8 Monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which for two generations of notorious fattest, cleared individual children, who are affectionate "little emperor", has produced a population crisis is in the country.
The average birth rate to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department for Environment, while the number of the population of 60 years and older by the year 2020 by 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 31,1% to rocket. this is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 year olds and elderly almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple nearby.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai urban population and family planning into said that couples get normal reproductive age have babies in order to help ", the proportion of ageing populations, and to alleviate the shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not so rich -- as the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, is China's one-child policy may be the most controversial provide by the ruling Communist Party was introduced until today.
Couples, who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up to her three times the annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy, that the critical exploitation of natural Landesressourcen could be avoided, while the defenders of human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned.
In rural regions have some officials pregnant women who already had a child, abzutreiben forced.
Many couples also had sex selektive offering, which an artificially high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their position on the one-child policy weakened.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been individual children -- and 2007, the tone of many tough slogans toned down.
Qiao xiao# chun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research of Beijing University said that government representatives recently even more radical changes, for example, to allow two children, couples where one partner individual child.
Shanghai in July for the first Chinese city that an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Posters which families belehrten, only to have a child, were almost overnight replaced by directives, which describe in detail who qualify for a second child, and how to apply for permission.
The city government has urban employees and volunteers for family planning to couples sent home and information sheets out under the doors.
They also asked a question of psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the foreign policies of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the applications from couples, which is after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported against any change.
In the Huinan municipality with a population of 115 000 than example still per month, only four or five requests.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign are still around 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Familienplanungskomitees Caolu of Shanghai municipality, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
You want to be the best her first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu juan juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and this is legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are assessing the one-child policy as the human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh month, is pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples psychological reasons for their reluctance to give in.
Wang, the personnel head, said she would like to just one child, because it was an individual child. 'we were the focus of the family and familiar that any of us.
We are not accustomed to us to care for others and not really want to do this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 Jährig, which a translation company, said it more merciless.
For parents out of the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, is about to be successful and that we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see such a life not for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother, her social life at least for two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the -- "if the child is 9 months old, you have to have a life for the best nursery schools have yet."
Most of his friends are ready, this one time, said Chen, but not two times.
Our generation is the first to a higher standard of living has achieved, he said.
We do not want to be too many sacrifices.
UN group reflects a plan to reduce emissions
The by the United Nations-sponsored conference on climate change -- until now by wild posturing and mutual accusations had -- on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, the industrialised nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide both rejoined the remaining obstacles, such as the way forward.
But he was as important progress in the negotiations, which are considered the time next week, as more than 100 leaders from around the world arrive in Copenhagen.
The text of a special UN working group was set up, is silent on the money supply, the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term, so that it can deal with the global warming.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industry and major emerging countries reduce their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase, which would support the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great flexibility, so John Coequyt, chief representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has six pages of the document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, with the focus on what the leading climate representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the big picture."
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations shared their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, wanted to reduce their emissions during major developing countries in the same period by 15 to 30% to reduce it.
Together, the countries of the emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95%.
The European Community, the talks on Friday also gave a boost by their assurances, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year in order to help poorer countries, the effects of climate change, the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, but the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week had intended.
The American climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected language, the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions of industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for more emerging countries, if they are not of the industrialised nations to be financed.
This train announced that the Obama a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not more than two years.
The United States will sign an agreement, without any significant emerging countries stand up and take action so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions by outsiders could be confirmed.
Stern gave its opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei, saying that it is the leading US climate negotiator either way "of reason," or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States, China would not financial help to cope with the global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the world's great powers that are at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between industrial nations and the emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, and to save the planet, with China and the United States squabbles about their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers in the fight to see the cost of the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions should bear, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively in the countries with very high greenhouse levy for what they did.
It is clear that this is a game, producing a new economic dominance will develop, so Ulate, which as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that the effects of climate change are the most vulnerable, said that they continue to be a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, even though the leading participants say that the talks in the best case will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning presented a 24 page draft treaty.
Artur Runge Metzger, who is the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they now are united and measures of the emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft, around and through the corridors of the bella# centres meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to claims "courts set, during the next week to be negotiated.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13,000 people are daily at the conference centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows, in which they make a joke about the countries who betrayed and sold their opinion, and draft agreements from hand to hand instead of passing the buck by Email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is based just on: almost all the important ministers are here, and as of Wednesday, 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Super League, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain first 225 kph fast train defined the installation of new
Monday morning at 5 13 will be a pipe through the darkness to a zugabe# transport, which is to announce a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed pendlerzug in the country will be in his lightning transport of Ashfort, Kent, London St Pancras 225 kph and 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the transport minister, are then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin Pendlerservices from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain up to an international rail network will be faster, more reliable trains ladies and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the north and Scotland to London will bind.
The neglected province could be Pendlerstädten alive, working anfahrt periods would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to track the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe to this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning slaughter and fears about environmental damage in the British Hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still applying the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company that was founded in January, the government should submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times the report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed sea map of the next planned stage of Hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new railway line linking London with the West Midlands will combine with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places term, where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site will be the plan the concept within a distance of 25 meters of the final stretch.
To HS2 three options for a larger, northwards to leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y förmig route, in which a single high-speed rail line in the West Midlands.
Would the route in or near Birmingham would share and a Abzweig Western the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of the Northeast as Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
An individual approach would lead to Scotland.
"it seems the most viable option," said to be a railways insider.
After the completion of the travel time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, not before 2025 would be opened, it would facilitate the travel of the London birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with now a little over an hour to go.
The proposals would offer the possibility of the trains with a speed of 400 km / h, thereby the British rail network would be the quickest Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people able to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could on the London birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London, which would be necessary to 20,000 passengers per hour could handle.
In view of the geographical restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will be known whether this plan, in his view, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains, first by the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, thereby changing the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours would be.
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from plane to train can ensure a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers' money for mortgages for 75,000 pfund# orangerie a conservative on
Alan Duncan, a leading member of the Conservative budget, the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of Orangerie account that he was in his home building in his constituency.

In the nearby houses have a sale price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).

The party alliance composed of FranÃ§ois Bayrou s party will be monitored the modem on Friday to a takeover bid of seals, which once controlled by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing party founded, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Mr Hervé Morin, a heavy response and it under threat of prosecution asked Siegel to use in any document.
Mr Hervé Morin announces public his intention to take the UDF Siegel, because he thought that FranÃ§ois Bayrou would not be worthy of this political heritage to defend after he extended a hand to the left.
The defence minister, whose party partner of the UMP is, incidentally, wanted this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in the hands of the NC), which received a claim on the property of the trademark UDF, because he was the first this brand of 2004 with the "Institute National de la propriété industrial" has asked for.
However, the office of the friends of FranÃ§ois Bayrou, UDF party alliance to monitor the silence and clearly gave us to understand that they would not expropriate and fixed the Minister and the Member under threat of prosecution a deadline, this seal can no longer use and their ownership of the brand.
You have in the last few days, a number of statements that you propose to your political movement, the UDF would take Siegelzu + +, wrote the party alliance into one of 19 of the 24 Büromitglieder signed letters, including FranÃ§ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party a modem, and the senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably thought, you have the right, the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogan + of today's UDF +, in their political material and on the starting side of your website to be possible.
As you know, you have no right to the use of that name, said the office of the UDF and calls on the party, NC, "immediately the mention of the name UDF of all material and (their) website 'to remove.
In addition, we requested by Mr Hervé de Charette, "the ownership of the brand in its legal challenge to qualify."
If you refuse, we will be brought against you, in order to ensure respect for the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF member to defend, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they stress that, "UDF" since 1978 and a fully-fledged political movement is a reminder that Morin and his friends "have made the choice to leave" the 2007 in order to set up a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, the party UMP ".
The party has therefore Nouveau centre, the undersigned, according to Siegel any rights, the UDF (Union pour la démocratie franÃ§aise).
You remember that in the last Congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year membership of the party a modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing movement, founded.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat is continuing, "he was at the time, as he has asked for the brand name, has for three years a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He is on scandalous and fraudulently benefited from the absence of the deposit of the Akronyms UDF, about this for themselves.
Furthermore, you have to bear in mind that this recklessness on the best way is to turn in a crime, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "it seems to us but in politics as in life more, to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come from the anonymity, by itself, of a name for itself, to which it has no legal rights."
Affaire Liliane bed stop: françois Jean-Marie Banier condemned for exploitation of weakness
The Court has decided to Nanterre on Friday, the artist françois Jean-Marie Banier judge to determine whether he, as the daughter of the Milliardärin Liliane bed stop, said a weak moment of 80-year-old has exploited in order to shareholders' being cheated out of part of their assets.
The 62-jährig photographer who is known for its star photos, on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375.000 will be punished.
This decision means that, in fact, a process in this Affaire, which will be the saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter scrap and at the same time the reins of Kosmetikimperiums L 'Oréal.
Equally, however, the 15 criminal court ordered a medical examination of the 87-jährig Liliane bed stop, who shared by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L 'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, particularly in the course of the investigation by the state prosecutor in Nanterre conditions presented.
The doctors are appointed on Friday before the 10th March 2010 to present a report in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times are Liliane bed outlined in a state of weakness may have been.
I think they will undertake these studies.
I will talk with her, said the lawyer, Me outlined by Mrs beds, George Kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). the report will show that he (Banier) this old lady has manipulated, which must be protected, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane bed stop, a criminal complaint against françois Jean-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him, the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings to be passed.
For its part, Liliane bed transports had always been refuted by the photographer, to be manipulated by them as a longtime friend.
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers complaint, have begun to examine the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday to a large family debacle.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane beds at three of its Klientin outlined in its notary sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which they wrote that the husband of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane added bed outlined the following: "could you please tell my daughter that I fifteen years, once or twice a day to Banier wrote.
Mrs, I have never been more talk since their marriage. "
The state prosecutor in Nanterre is again the view that the plaintiff had no right to react, especially because a vormundschaft# judge in the last few days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against their mother.
Liliane bed stop, "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no legal guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Mrs christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt Meyers has taken place.
Managerial revolution or the end of the strategic early education.
If nothing will change in the leadership of major French enterprises, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its staff, said the position of companies discussion partner the consumer from the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff "values" certain the best, as it was earlier on the Consumer Produkte shaped by the technicians in the work.
By taking the customers in the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of markets in place... although, given the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of the customers to impose regularly again.
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees affected.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, particularly to those of R & Eund, even more importantly, it is on those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, calls for the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "of all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach" by the staff; it takes a commitment, which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradictory.
We therefore call for a revolution that would be the staff in denMittelpunkt of the concerns of the company, equal to the customers.
The very conditional use internal polls
Will the internal polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange its wage earners, this revolution in terms of the management practices suggest.
I am afraid, unfortunately.
- firstly, because I was able to establish that the whole fabric in the face of a new situation for many a circuitous route, finally taking priority... to do what it has always done.
Also, because the authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
Finally, because most leaders a very simplified view of human behavior.
Emerging from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology of mechanistic.
You take by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the US, "'he said, neuroscience and unknowingly far-reaching of research institutions and the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, "levers" (sic) to the involvement of employees to operate a aktuellein Le Figaro published by Ipsos poll. former executives in a position to a mechanistic management system, which is inadequate for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure
Instead, a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is in any idea or practice of management to integrate a basic protocol: for wage earners, the commitment to the company only if it clearly as a means to a part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
At present, only the studies to take over from the multifunctional analysis this conception of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their company on the basis of a set, Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it allows them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these mobilisation factors, the executives of the companies their "social work" control, predict and preempt and its Human resource management back to the right place.
For example, they create a breeding ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
The speech by Oslo: the 'just war', Obama praised by law
The American right on the Friday of the of Barack Obama speech on the eve of Oslo welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize as of 2009, the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, the allocation of the price of Obama on 9 October scoff at this time, applauded the speech by the President, the example of former Vice presidential candidate in the 2008 elections Sarah Palin following.
I liked what he said Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in their recently published memoirs, have raised.
The war is, of course, the last thing that I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who two wars of his predecessor, George W. Bush has inherited the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, has tried in Oslo on Thursday, the use of violence to justify a way in his Entscheidungvon nine days to explain the 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt ging# Friedrich, took the view in Oslo, the Präsdent have "very good work".
I found that the speech was really very good meeting lockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's.
In some parts of habeich this speech is as historically perceived Ginrich said in the radio show "The take# away 'have been questioned.
The previous Member of Parliament, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential elections in 2012, said he was pleased a "President of the left," to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee noted that they were "not without a price for peace, not without the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to the fact that he is "cosmopolitan", as he always does, "he said," as an American President, "as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they themselves have created for their protection and do a lot, "Gerson.
Among the less than convinced rights called the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "dull, pretentious and inspirationslos."
On the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich concerned as Barack Obama resorting to the armed forces.
Verpackt the war under the guise of Justice, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains favourable to the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view is that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Obama premature, called the speech itself for a speaker like him for his talent is known as "monumental# station."
The speech in Oslo "offers an expiry plan for the management of international decisions on the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse" and his speech was described as a "dark and exemplary also."
Drivers: three marathon for an agreement, which ensures the supply of Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the Straßenverbandes and TLF - the only employers' organisation, which remained to the end, on Friday evening to an agreement that the strike order and the threat of severe supply crunch puts an end to Christmas.
The signature meeting on Friday evening, "welcomed" the for the transport of Assistant Secretary Dominique Bussereau the agreement reached on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations was launched.
After a second night of the negotiations is separated those conducting the negotiations on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement late in the morning to sign quickly.
And although the three employers' federations, Unostra (FNTR and OTRE) the meeting angry left.
However, it has taken more than six hours of the start of the meeting at 11: 00 pm until the conclusion of the agreement and first at 18: 00 o'clock, the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have very much damage to the companies" and "it was a fear that the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau would affect.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wages (international transportation).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages, is rising by 8,72 euro on 9,06 euros.
"this is not very much, but we are first of all, to" Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block supply centers.
"it is likely to narrow pens# always a few who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF Vorsitzende Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult, "these wage increases to face international competition."
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"this agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT), on this matter, "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of the year 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective bargaining agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the charges for employers to the tune of EUR 100 million," the subject of an amendment to the government on the draft of the amended finances for 2009, which was on the night of Thursday to Friday, was adopted by the National Assembly.
The government is asking for a "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the organisation affiliated businesses, and that they later in the case of an extension of the labour minister for the whole profession.
This is "in a very short time", said Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The Association of FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade 'because the 100 million euro" were the sector to offset a part of the carbon tax has already been promised. "
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the gans# esser+s to the approaching Christmas season, complained to avoid disgruntling Unostra.
For the association agreement, "Otre threatens the small and medium-sized companies in the sector in the next 12 months to digging a big grave."

The disturbances on the line RER A, the most rapid rail network in France for the Paris region and the Ã®le de France, over the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), the strikers with their demands for wage premia on the cards.

The sections of the RATP connects the places Saint Germain en Laye and Nanterre and Boissy Saint Léger issued and Marne La Vallée.
On Friday, altogether about one of the two trains on the main road time planned, and almost no during the verkehrsarm time.
As of Thursday, there were no human gewühl on the platforms, as the residents of the Ã®le de France had stopped on the situation.
This early in the morning, the station of Saint Germain en Laye (Yvelines) was far less run over than usual, particularly because of the lack of high school graduates.
In Boissy Saint Léger issued (Val de Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would just "one and a half hours earlier on stood up to get to work."
The SNCF, which care for travel by officials and police had planned, pointed out that it is in Saint Lazare station had come to no bottlenecks.
The SNCF RER A on the line or in the direction of Cergy Le skin operated trains came to or went there on the railway station of Saint Lazare, at the end of the underground.
On Saturday and Sunday were renewed general meetings of the strikers, during which the results were reviewed by the associations after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon were classified as "poor".
The RER Geschäftsführer proposed the specific drawing up a Protocol for the line RER A, with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are asking for a long overdue wage premium.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP, even their Lohnzuschlagsvorschläge in brackets, and stressed that the leadership "is in no position to solve a problem, but the drivers and the SNCF but has also made it possible."
The RATP made it clear that another meeting to "comprehensive examination of the working conditions," was scheduled for Monday.
This shows the associations, too, that the company "the weekend drivers ignored."
On the morning of about 150 drivers were the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leaders, who have rejected any kind of discussion during the strike, and a meeting for a calming of the situation was close.

Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdish party decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday was the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision that immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is the work of the government, which is huge to make it more difficult for the Kurdish community tried to reach out for 25 years, in order to put an end to during conflicts.
The "party for a democratic society" (DTP), was dissolved, since it has become a "platform for action was for the independence of the state and its indivisible unity be harmful," the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.

The decision followed a in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya proceedings. he accused the DTP, which "command" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP, the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
The party, "no link" to the PKK, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to the negotiating table.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court transmits a message to your computer the government intervened, which is seeking to accommodate the Kurdish community and a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, with the support of the PKK is stifled by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast anatolien could lead, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in recent weeks clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators outside the premises of the DTP millions in the city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which are largely populated by Kurds.

"it is obviously a reaction from the PKK," taken, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK on the attack, in which three days earlier, seven soldiers in the north of Turkey died. this was one of the most brutal attacks of recent months.
New silicon# valley
For years, it was considered secret city for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of 10 districts of the capital of Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded location for secret arms research.
Today, the town hall, with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, as a "Russian Silicon Valley."
Major research and production sites for micro and nanotechnology electronics are here.
For September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt scientific base Riedberg, linked with the Uniinstituten and businesses of the Frankfurt innovation centre dedicated (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and signed on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy bürgermeister Yuri Rosljak and prefect, Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation for Frankfurt, Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
Representatives of the FIZ 2010 and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar for Selenograd travel.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies in the FIZ will, on the growing Russian market.
Conversely want Russian Wissenschaftsfirmen contracts in Germany walked off.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and enterprises.
These include the Moscow Institute for electrical engineering, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja electronics.
The municipality was 1958 when the so-called "socialist planned city" for the defence research has been established.
Selenograd (literally translated, "green city") got its name from the wooded hill landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply, "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the low set a train station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital, for a decade in utter chaos will topple construction sites.
Stuttgart 21, in the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks that end up in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, as disengage a modern rail transport, as it once was a huge amount of time needed, locomotives from behind umzuspannen forward.
Trial period, briefly, to travel further to go, bringing.
So let the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And, in Stuttgart: a space station, which is about halfway through the trans-European schienen# magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - is the slogan of "the heart of Europe."
S21 is now real, even though the visions of the 1980s, no longer are compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that he and the Bavarian city is almost priceless, the low down.
Head stations also have no import and ausfahrt problem more, since modern Wendezüge with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the Neubaustrecke after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have.
The railways power with, because the risks of major infrastructure Einzelprojekts of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
Städtebaulich is still reasonably justify the project.
It creates new urban area, which is the computer generated graphics of the planners - with much green.
For the transport system S21 is harmful.
The transit depot and the sea reclamation are intended for the movement, which, typical 1980s - brought huge growth.
At that time, there were no competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but first it must be to strengthen the freight transport, the transport to rail is much cleaner than by lorry on the road.
But the new sound because of severe climbs not for freight trains.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion to EUR in Schwäbische are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
The fact is, in the next decade, the money to other hubs and closest captains in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of good 180 kilometres through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, the route in slow motion.
It would be necessary, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The rheintal route will be the real bottleneck for the international transport of goods, right in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering verdict on the Airport

Minister Posch refuted the accusation by Mr Schäfer Gümbel, the provincial government have been trying, with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to its night flights.
A precise legal review their time of need.
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legal safe Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Therefore, as the opposition, are the media, said his group has never been a night ban.

Thanks to this evidence journalistic independence it could Schächter without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a faithful to lever into office.

Entrümpelt will study
Partial success for the students: after a year of Bildungsstreiks drew the ministers of the countries on Thursday a: at a meeting of kultusminister and University Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to, the study conditions improve in Bachelor and Masters Course.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
The individual was relying on to reduce the audit constraints: in principle, every modul only with a single test.
Moreover, the workload of the students checked and "a realistic and reasonable".
Politics and universities, want the recognition of auditing services between universities within and outside of Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Master courses more flexible.
Having differing national arrangements should be.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture Ministers and Uni rector the toe of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now it was the first time with a specific format.
The so-called Akkreditierungsrat decided the number of tests to drastically reduce part: "each module includes usually with only a test, a 30 Seiten paper which the authorisation of courses in part to the way.
With the "significant reduction of the audit of proof," said the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted."
Moreover, the "Studierbarkeit" future "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules as content are "strictly to examine" whether "unnecessary restriction of students in the choice of
Events would prevent ".
The students had "right, margins to preserve and promote the own initiative."
Gelten should the rules for the admission of new, but also in the review existing courses.
These are all five years of "reakkreditiert", which means that it takes until 2015, until all the courses were reviewed.
The authority responsible for this are federal far ten accreditation agencies, which set up by the countries Akkreditierungsrat.
The ministers of the countries had in October "strongly" urged on the agencies, too, that the abundance of fuel, not too big and the verification regime is too strict.
In each, universities and colleges with the agricultural ministries have already agreed to appropriate measures.
As currently the only country said in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds.
The money the universities, in particular, to tutor programs and academic advice and review and strengthen foreign offices.
The country and universities will spend ten million euros.
The government wants to start in 2010, a revision of the university law Parliament.
This is for the conclusion of a study model only one examination be necessary.
The study design is to be more flexible, and the recognition of performance certificates to other universities and facilitate access to the Masters Course.
By the end of next year all the courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit be reviewed.
Government and opposition on Thursday to discuss the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal executive of Juso Hochschulgruppe called for the development of education policy, in future, not more "behind closed doors," the minister and university rectors.
After the Bildungsstreiks should now also the students and interested parties "have a say."
The future graduates received support from the President of the university Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "we need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The union Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn Process as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim, which each graduate with a Bachelor conclusion access to a secondary master degree effectively.
On the other, countries must ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor Studierenden sufficient Masterstudienplätze tomorrow with the best possible studying conditions available as GEW Vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar.
The countries must be much more teachers.
At a freer access to the Masters Course would not, however, the ministers.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Discussion in Germany and is fine almost no control... "is the first line of a poem by a poet Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language scrap the arrival experience of a dissident, who won the freedom, but at the same time has lost its language.
The 1951 in Romania's Banat Werner Söllner first born as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as a Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he worked in 1982 to Frankfurt am Main übersiedelte.
Söllner is with various literary prices excellent. in 1993, he was the legendary Poetikvorlesung at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he is head of the he Mousonturm literary Forum in Frankfurt.
For considerable outside literary sensation last Tuesday he made during a meeting in Munich, where "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorted levels of their Securitateakten."
Visibly insecure and move Söllner read out a statement in which he before Romania German writers' colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as' for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present had Söllner in 1989, the German language Prize.
The anwerbung# experiments have been creeping started in 1971, first.
I am, Söllner concluded, "anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is' Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize ehrung for Herta Müller and unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule are the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of from Romanian and German authors of a case that the abyss and the cowardice of a political system makes clear, which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is so far one can say after previous knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but victims.
In his Securitate Akte have played a role on 'Walter, said after the confession Söllners the literary scholar Michael Markel and pointed to his positive influence of the' Walter.
He gave it to him in all difficult issues "at the time being," Markel.
It is a moral need, this remark to make.
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany is a cosy preserve for securitate spies and so on, Herta Müller had already in July in the time after they wrote their own act, 914 sides had read.
The people concerned, we should be, and in some case speculated may have known what to name it behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu, Walter was.
Unlike the hard disk now very procedural safer sighting of the Stasi Akte is dealing with the legacy of the securitate monitoring still very diffuse.
A systematic investigation is thwarted in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the Birthler authority in accordance with National Council for getting to grips with the Securitate Akte (CNSAS) was first set up in 1999, the publication of the files but has since been rather slow.
It was not until 2005, there is a law that governs the administration of the acts.
The fact that the influence of former securitate members in Romania is still very great, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former head of securitate from Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
You have a climate, only once have they interrogated.
The scandal of the power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly the case Söllner, as so often in connection with willingly publicize fault inevitable questions.
Why only now damaged. who was the calm reaction to listen Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of the urge for knowledge rather than apportioning blame and shame will be determined.
At the Genese of Herta Müller yesterday, which has received the Nobel Peace Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Championship
It was as if dressed as a smart Außendienstler of a very nice Christmas party at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange Plastiktüte of the operator of a quarter of an hour after midnight in a cause ¨ C-Klasse rose.
The man with the distinctive Glatze left him because of the chauffieren foreign city.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive themselves, alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before luck was the 55-Jährig any more.
Was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work on.
Or first right away.
In the words of the first three days earlier Swiss: "we are committed to the achtel# final achieved, namely" in the Championship, thanks to the 3: 1 Erfolgs against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we should not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal battle against the decline."
The "much more important task" is on the Sunday before.
Then, in Mainz the royal second-class performance in the league lives again.
And the very once again exposed weaknesses in the fast three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots to appoint
The achtel# final of the Champions League (Hinspiel 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / return match 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) on 18 December in Nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers.
The joy of the brilliant commencement of the Nachfolgers Babbel was up to.
Not only in the case of the alleged hope of salvation, which the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the brief time, confidence, dedication and given to enjoy the game.
I have received on the players and told them that they have on their strengths, and have urged them to be bolder in mind, said klempner Gross just sounding recipe for success, with no effect but therapist Babbel had ceased.
It has sparked a certain magic, Babbel defender Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus in football, sometimes things happen that you do not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira after lengthy injury break, thanks to its dynamic equal to the best player in the room, has the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new boss: "he is a man who demands and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had apparently been there.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain sports executive Horst Heldt, warns
The VfB Stuttgart needs but especially constancy.
As Gross proponents were very careful not because players and managers, the victory against a spare weakened and completely overwhelmed defenses of the Romanian guests.
You might have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen in 0: 4 the rude awakening came to bear in mind, Khedira.
And sports executive Horst Heldt reminded that a seasonal objectives have been achieved, and the other is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
The fact that Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not feeling, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a just before the beginning of the game in the TV interview broadcast by Torhüter Jens Lehmann fresh auflebten.
There are decisions that others take, and not the Jens Lehmann konterte Heldt the harsh criticism.
It accused the board of directors had shown weakness and change of coach who have decided to put pressure pubertierend fans.
The fact that his free day after Games had been withdrawn, Lehmann took as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmann statements were "of pure egotism," keilte Heldt, consequences for the final countryman.
You have no friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all the others agree that without the preparatory work by the team of coach who replaced the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann all - and also the man with the Plastiktüte agreed.
World Cup fight in the heavyweight

Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and sought only make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings, the world champion but rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo hoffe# countryman in the year 2000, which with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had the fight in the Swiss capital, for some.
He has outraged Klitschko as "ugly zombie," which is "not right".

Supposedly, whose doctorate society is planning now, the fight against Klitschko in London wembley stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition, Green Party leader, Mr Trittin, Defence Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and the Left sought explanations of the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin, according to the latest information on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition, Defence Minister Charles theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister to the deadly bombing of two tanker lorry carrying liquid in September "knowingly speaking the truth," said said Green Party leader, Mr Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD Nachrichtensendung "television."
It is called the popular: he lied.
The order for the killing was in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was revealed that, in the attack not only a destruction of abducted vices, but also about two Taliban leaders targeted to kill.
In the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein sought US Luftangriff, the NATO report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Greens, the Social Democrats and left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to express to clarify what Guttenberg really know about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the Chancellery, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague, Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm had the criticism.
The chancellor did not on specific operations of the German armed forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of General inspectors Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the mirror, the two Guttenberg correct and complete on the background of the Tanklaster Anschlags informed.
Officially, it was told that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and the Minister of sensitive details.
For the environment of the two top officials said, however, that the defence ministry even on several reports have pointed out, including a two-page document of the command those Colonel Klein and a field hunting report.
Wichert is now in a letter to clarify the issue, reported to have asked the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
He has not had a response, it says.
On Saturday, the ministry said no to the accusations and pointed out that this in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag resolved, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Dream environments
Some people see in alert status pictures and hearing voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge in blurs the boundaries between Imagination and reality.
As long as it is happening in their sleep, all is well.
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should have exacerbated the wildest imagination and fantasy creations.
But anyone who dreams in a similar situation be seen things and does not see, or hear in the modern Western world is as crazy or drug addicts, at least as a special presently.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental illness or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or novels, sometimes to ensure that the borders between dream, delusion and reality become blurred.
Similar changes can Wachbewusstseinszustände dreams in a variety of forms, at best, we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Although cause and effect may distinguish the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Binge, the Drogenerlebnisse of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanisch Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations but on similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural chemical mediators, headed Dopamin brain, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin - perverted and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The force of gravity has no power over him
The connection of delusion and dream, philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle term hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, noted 1861 "a great similarity of misleading to dream," for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a climate of fear, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such."
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic# figure.
His body is two dimensions and squeal colourful.
The force of gravity has no power over him, he is hanging on to the President ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him saying vicious gestalt+s with Mr Fratze distorted, zähnefletschend.
You are hunting him him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Although, vicious voices roar from walls and Radio.
He can no longer bear the votes to attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cables from the stereo, knotet a noose and fortified them in a hole in the ceiling.
He is rising on a loud speaker and is tightening the noose around the neck.
Is there.
The noose does.
This should be a lesson to you shout the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "Walk in the clinic and let you cure."
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, the past is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
She was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoide climate, he is also bi-polar, he takes medication against depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In the climate of fear is the worst I have seen and deepest despair, he says.
The obsessions are cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population at least once in a lifetime ill with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is the second most common illness after depression.
As an acute schizophrenic climate of most of those affected can no longer between internal and external world, they are caught in a situation to hallucinations, benefits, relationships or paranoia.
The vote is particularly widespread hearing voices, who comment on command or dialogisieren.
Even visual hallucinations are not rare.
The patient is not important to separate more trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disruptive signals, the consciousness of impressions flooded.
As the dream to the climate of opening the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies that deeper awareness classes come from.
The perception of reality in the climate of concentration level is, says Professor Thomas fox, head doctor of the clinic for general psychiatry in the Universitätsklinika Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic lies at the heart of what has happened, everything has a significance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, it will, like the dream of the events overwhelmed and it may not active.
The schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A technical adjustment is not possible, most of them in to the mirages are up to the cruel reality.
Once in life to have experienced a Halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says, "left guard but the voluptuous and geographical structure of reality that is perceived in the climate of principle."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in reality, the Verfremdung of experience will take place in real terms.
Why is our brain researchers antics, is still a mystery.
Exceptional conditions for every human being can lead to the reality that he loses a short time, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers believe that involved minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain in an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, guard explained.
But it remains a mystery, as the disturbance of the neural system, which is, furthermore, first of all manifestiere over many years.
Even environmental factors play a role, stress or trauma can be led to a climate of fear, if the choice is there.
Halluzinogene drugs can also cause psychosis, as they are in the central system.
If our brain hot runs
The madman, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines to get rid of them, others money for drugs in order to get to them, says the Lübecker psychology professor, Erich caste.
Whether fantasies as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Box for ten years, is collecting reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen, last year, his results in the book "the unreal world in our head," evaluated.
Hallucinations are, of course, among the typical manifestations of psychosis, but also by an astonishing number of other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as on-board line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain circumstances, hallucinated the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from memory content, which would normally be held back.
They arise when, in which areas which have sensory processing, hyperactive or less inhibited and if our brains are hot, or even if stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or a climate.
But even sensory deprivation, stress, love kummer or other mental exceptional situations.
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said, at least once in life to have experienced a Halluzination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended high school there.
A normal girl, really.
If the images and voices.
In the pause, it can happen that a schlaksig boy with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he says, see the classmates surprisingly - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the timid girl for a stop Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it knows it.
It is awake, she hears and sees this boy, as well as the girl in the bank and alongside it.
You can even feel his presence, at least for the moment.
A pleasant feeling is it may be the boy.
Am I crazy, they sometimes asks.
But they know that this boy and the other fantasies is not real, and then disappear again.
Late night are the things most frightening
Often, the obsessions is a burden.
If it sits in the schoolroom, it can sometimes do not follow the curriculum, because the teacher in their eyes and ears just a new Mitschüler while he presents for all the other well and visible from the bar of mathematical equations.
Late night are the things most frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, they often do not consider whether it is already dreaming or awake, whether the images that they see the Fratze or the girl with the bleeding wounds, cuts in arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me out in a calm, the figures.
Parents and friends told them they would not gain the barking mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has in the past year, insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologist caste, knows it well that they are not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is social isolation or sensory deprivation, has it with great likelihood, hallucinations, says box for a while.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a small girl fear of other children, often, she played alone.
Your hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they called dad, since they can think of, not her biological father.
As in visual and audio hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah K. serious, fantasies and reality. "any experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, why are they so real. "
Even night-time images of digesting caste as a form of Halluzination.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from the time of acute climate.
In contrast to the schizophrenic mentally healthy ones are in the situation, their fantasies as unrealistic.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as special ability wertzuschätzen.
Border state between dream and Halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience, unfortunately, most pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A climate of fear is a difficult and painful disease, but it also has positive, creative, fantasy is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt Degenhard, the so-called oneiroide form of erlebnis# researched, a special form of dream type of modified of awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex and detailed virtual dreams of the Erlebend for real, and which he subsequently also distinguish the convoy of emergency.
The oneiroide state of awareness in trauma or illness, for example, in extreme situations Polyradikulitis Patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person of self- and loss of the world is threatened by continued, total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening real situation by means of its own, imaginary world of the reality of decoupled, says Schmidt Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and Halluzination.
Since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible, a world of letters, but the real situation in the Imagination.
An intensive form of good Foundation and meaning in an intolerable situation that allows us people own ability, not in a nothing of the Bewusstseinsverlustes.
Everything is real, later in the memory
Even the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen its Oneiroid Erlebnisse describes in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart klappe# operation, followed by a heart transplant for days to travel somewhere, while his body to the intensive care unit to Bewegungslosigkeit condemns it.
Claussen, a in a world made, other times and places to visit: he is seen as a bettlägerig, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in early middle age among dignitaries who narcotic from blood.
If a Greek on the motorcycle, whose own country, kidnapped, surf in bed with his hospitalized Firnschnee of the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined events, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel differ fundamentally from any dream for Claussen.
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys and even after years in the minor details.
And even more bemused than real experience.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other living weltlich experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard.
At the end of the Oneiroide show, psychosis, hallucinations and drug binge how fragile our internal Abbild+s of external reality in the guards.
Any change in the Bewusstseinszustandes, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be enriching.
The snow will fall can
Burda
Children should the publishing house to play with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda company wants to be in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The Holding will also in future to 100% of the family.
Hamburg, the publisher Hubert Burda, his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Two children to inherit with 27 years and have the firm will to enter into the company, said the 69 Jährig the mirror.
The details we have regulated as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot swallow his children 7 500 staff, if they are not enough.
This brings the children, and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is in January by the board of directors, and paul# bernhard Kallen appointed to his successor.
The 52 years since 1999 Kallen is a member of the board of Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury, the responsibility for the corporate assets, and after the departure of Mr Todenhöfer the direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time that she is not a family member in the forefront of the publishing house.
Burda children are 19 and 17 years old, his son, Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is inexplicable, "10, 15 years," Burda to bridge.
The Holding also should be 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases and Burda Schickedanz Schaeffler said that family company is not in the fall are safe, "that was always families who have contracted by a capital that have completely verspekuliert and thought they could rise as the major player.
My strategy was never the case.
He had "never World Dreams" had such Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor Springer this country, as it was, and I do not want to in the World League with "Time 'play the game, these shops are too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Äuerst Peek is limited, a device, which can only be his Email read, without a chance to see some annexes or through the Internet to surf.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is on the Strae to see is more unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate an iPhone.
After the company that has seen the success it has two new equipment on the market: one, which is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, unlike the Peek, at which it will pay six times higher.
Fonpeek yesterday in Le Web is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits, as his American counterpart, however, was a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming across Europe.
Those with a Smartphone travel the world, already know what it means to all of the data have to surrender his Email+s in order to be able to read once you cross the border, or if you are desperate for a bar with WIFI Addiction (or a means of access with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already special contracts and prices for placements, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission on affordable roaming prices for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auerhalb of own country has always afraid to read his Email+s and rightly so.
The fact that a small machine as FonPeek (which it always amazing is that the name Fon, although there is no Wifi / WLAN) this kind of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers are slowly but surely to rethink and start to consider various ways of how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the Downloaden of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without a catch.
This is a internetfähiges equipment, and it is only one single occasion, buying, and not every month.
This is exactly what I also of a day of FonPeek expect a purchase option with lifelong access to the Internet as the Peek already in the United States.
And not because I want to buy.
I read my Email+s with the telephone, thank you.
Rather, I expect this, because I believe that there is a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to have a computer with the same system to be able to see.
The fetisch# colours of Michelle
Gelb is without doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even with the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions: auer borne very similar models, that it is almost the same colour was - a bright green yellow - the clothing from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same textiles, and it was something groförmig gestickt or a chain.
It even goes as far as the first sight, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothing differ greatly in the Stoffart, from which they are produced.
At the inauguration, she was wearing a dress from head and from gemustert Samt in Oslo.
Even the accessories were different: the first green shoes with six high (and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair style every time was different: the hair were in this cause than hair wreath ambitious, in the previous, the hair.
75% of the working mothers, because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This result is the of CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women study "fertility and careers of women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of the working women see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted because of their motherhood.
The study is open, that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work.
Those of you who auerhalb of the House, do no other work only half day work or for a fixed contract of employment, more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, the women postpone with a permanent jobs, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and have fewer children.
"the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years ago with a permanent jobs their first child, on average, only 3.7 years, a number that grows to 4.1 years for women with permanent jobs, which have taken longer to achieve this and draw it together, and the first child have achieved until much later.
Auerdem also has the kind of work a groen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of the contraceptive readiness, "declared the CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that in the age of the women in marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey is the age at the time of the wedding, and the first child even higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they only the main education or higher education, on average, each with 25,1 or 32,1 mother for the first time.
There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before their first permanent employment marry and have their first child, make it the women with an intermediate or high school exactly the opposite and seek out first a permanent employment and marry later and receive their first child, Delgado.

Auer, that this book is a delightful reading consumption, it is also an emotional call to reading and more reading.
Here are a few extracts from the book.
In addition to Albert Camus: "reading its pages I found that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous drive, just as I have always felt without words: the pleasure to have found, in contrast to the disastrous fate, the morality without guilt and innocence without a God."
In addition to Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he is in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a devastatingly poetic, without any sense of humour, such as the one blade to etch that almost killed him."
In addition to Graham Greene: "our man was of this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, dermaen seized in the meat, the emotions on grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse to human rights, a spiritual privilege was in the sky, on the basis of the destruction."
In addition to James Joyce's "Ulysses", was in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. this is one of the 8000er summits in the world literature, you have to climb to the northern wall, on the wall, where again the best mountaineers to try. "
In addition to William Faulkner: 'it was a strange Kauz.
He said sometimes about himself, that he is the legacy of a Gutsbesitzer of the county would be and still other times, he said that he is the son of a black and a crocodile.
Two dreams won by a certain Gröe. "
More than of ferdinand Céline: this writer, the mad cry on which to build a bridge from of the figure from Munich was playing outside, so that its response to deep in the night of the 20th century on the literary way hallte out. this he made during a visit to which he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the worms anflehte posterity.

In addition to Virginia Wolf: "in her luggage they had their depression.
The husband took it with complete normality, when it said that Eduard VII it between the Azalee ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek.
It is not the only other case, where the man known as much patience and in a Neurotikerin was in love, the literary talent much gröer than their craziness. "
More than Pío Baroja: "what was otherwise martín santos, than to try to inspire in Joyce's Baroja.
As far as intended because Benet Baroja, if he is not in the arms of Faulkner was used.

Cowardly aggression
My 70-year mother was last week by our city in the town of Fuenlabrada, while a group of young people between 15 and 18 years herliefen alongside their and our dog, the dog is a compound of which we have pulled from the animal sanctuary and just six kilos, and then goes out of the blue failure to kick him two ritt+s and injure him so hard.
Our indignation, one can never capture in words incomprehensible to us, because it is where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which is, of course, to the leash.
In addition to the attack, in which a woman who was walking comfortable when these people because of the incident to chastise, they even feared for their own lives, because if such a crazy a dog attacked, it will be the same, perhaps with a woman, a child, an older Mr or probably even with every turn weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet urban area at 5 p.m. on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog geheult all day.
We have, of course, in a nahgelegen police department reported, however, we have great doubts about whether anything will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation that has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what is in the minds of these young people that they have to be a cheap attack on a helpless animal to find fun on an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people are.
Michelin and Fesvial common for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs especially among the younger motorcyclists as both companies announced today.
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the Helmgebrauchs, since it is ultimately the only protection element which head injuries or even death in the event of a power radu if able to prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the road safety, which is "far more than just the idea and Herstellen+s products with every day more and more secure" and confirmed that they will continue with other action educational and informative nature contribute to this goal every day is a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' is, in a first phase posters of about 500 motorcycle repair statt+s, so as to achieve the best possible spread.
Finally, the Michelin, stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company is, and it is precisely for the reason that they are manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles is obliged to do so, which one of its main objectives the development of always safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again slightly
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks to a light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles in November in Spain have been registered, a rise of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase even after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, gemä the constructors' association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam figures presented.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with groer genieen caution, as compared to the November 2008 reference data, which is a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% over the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the overall approval of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous business year.
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles were sold in this number, but all vehicles, from which the small transport market, it is: descendants of passenger cars, Pick startups, light commercial vehicles, small supply vehicle and lighter small truck / bodywork.
It is still the same storm clouds in the sky, what the demand will suffer most, because even if some of the vehicles bought by private individuals, the Groteil of sales to small and medium-sized companies, which almost 100% of all cases, the purchase with a third financing.
This is the way to these restrictions, which are the result of the supply to tap the credit institutions, with einschlieen other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this situation, and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial aid to buy a vehicle of the plan 2000E little helped.
This plan, however, is not only for private individuals, including self-employed and small businesses have a right to a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, which is not 160 grams per mileage more than to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Only yesterday Ganvam had again reminded that it is required by the state, is also a special attention on these small vans and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealer association for the 2010 predicts a similar year just as the last one, with a sales shortfall (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now duty
What then was the blockieren# ABS and brake system as it now with the stability control ESP happens, the aid systems on the brakes in emergencies a mandatory requirements in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, for the rest of the vehicles was a transition period until the end of February 2011.
The decision by the European Union Manahme aims to improve the protection of the Fugänger, but these braking systems because of their operation also help to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the notbremse# assistant, is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system on the basis of the driver said braking starch on the brake pedal acknowledges.
However, this system this pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the bosch# fahrzeuge+s research, a third of the drivers to be involved in an accident before the collision even more on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Until 1.100 accidents
The braking assistance against, with maximum force in the braking system and reduced the braking time and therefore also the braking distance that a car back in the braking process.
According to a study in the EU could each year to 1.100 fatal accidents in which Fugänger hurt, be prevented if all cars with this sort of notbremse# assistants would be equipped.
It would even be fewer accidents, it is estimated that every fourth accident with injuries could be prevented, as soon as the so-called intelligent Notbremssysteme+s popularity.
Then there is the vehicle equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles, and the driver warns it at the same time, with a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helped him in the system, the pressure on the brake pedal, if it is necessary to increase.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision already is unavoidable, the Brake Assist system the maximum pressure on the brakes, so that the damage as low as possible.
General Motors, the plan for Opel postponed until January
While the workforce of the Opel plant at Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new at the Figueruelas factory in the first week of April will probably start on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturers point out that more time is needed to the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wishes to ensure that the affected their approval of each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, can it be that the final document, which the workers first and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be put off until the beginning of 2010.
Demented against by GM assured that in the next few days a decision on the sale of Saab will take.
Since it is not surprising that the Swedish government pressure on the American car manufacturer has increased as soon as possible, so that a decision.
GM, too, with some possible new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper Sportwagen, which the Russian group Converg backing, more and more.
If none of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM some assets to the Chinese BAIC sell.
The decision to schlieen Saab end of the year, if not by then have been sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel was used by the engineers the Boxster S as a basis and slipped him really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilogram.
In order to create something confirmed it as the first on the automatic aufklappbar roof of a tent line migrant roof has been replaced with manual accord, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms; thanks to the Aluminiumtüren used in this model, like the GT3 'disappearance' of a further 15; by the exclusion of the air conditioning again 13; auerdem one has the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, was reduced to a further 7 kilograms, were saved by the installation of sporting Bacquet Sitzen again 12 and with the easy 19 inches Felgen five saved again.
Then we had even without the audio system CDR increased 30 again six kilos less and the exchange of Türgriff by Griff+s from substance, the lack of kilograms.
Although he also with the double kupplung PDK wheel is available, the trial navigation with a vehicle with 6 gängigen small wheel, mainly on the smaller Landstraen of California, to mountain routes, which were really very kurvig.
During his driving, you can only give him the note was impeccable.
The reduction of his weight, but does not mean that he is no longer so sure would be on the Strae.
Rather, the opposite is the case, for a long time, we have no longer such a small and light model test, which is a but also a sense of groer security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete,, his muscles in a low gear in the time required to warm to him until we give the orders to slow down, of course, to recover and then all over again from his engine to get out...
He makes everything he says. the car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its management, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The Sound of its V6 Boxer with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can still raise it with the 'sport' -Option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which already was the first time the Panamera.
The beschleunigung# capacity is incredibly brutal, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration.
The Federung are strong but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraen where we were with the Boxster Spyder was already somewhat damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps good.
The electronic assistants have had on the entire route to do almost nothing; and, although we in some of these curves ice in the early hours of the morning and Rollsplitt.
In conclusion, it is an ultra light car, a car, with which it has an appalling road passport, as it would otherwise rather rare, and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car is on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 euros.

The Baskonia is itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral story, despite the many lost players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, a great triumph with 82 91 in his visit to the complex Fuballfeld of Maccabi Electra and is in the first place in its group after the groartigen appearance of Mirza, who Teletovic with eight three fachen+s the best of his team was (29 in the assessment).
The team from Vitoria, the significant shortfalls of countryman, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a very broad sense of commitment and teamwork, even if it is to the bitter end to its victory seem to wait.
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 rated three fachen+s mageblich wore on her final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten which, from the very beginning at the top of the screen.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Perimeter came out, it was already that it holds on to the pitch with good reheated wrist.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18 to 20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava for a domestic side tritium game of Barac chose and for the game of Eliyahu, who in his return to the team with Pfiff and applause was received by his home is to their advantage before the break to further develop (34 43).
Teletovic began, as the best of his team with 13 points, including wennn "minus six" assessment of speck can already guess lieen that this is not the best night of Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game despite the clear advantage into the break has not yet decided and the Makkabäer Vitorianer wanted to remind you, not on their pitch, and thanks to the constantly attacking 'hand of Elías' they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini wore central to ensuring that the "gelb+s" of hand counting (50 49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, had to take a few opening gambits with accuracy in order to prepare again and one of them came from the gun suddenly Mirza, who Teletovic with three almost successive three fachen+s and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that again on the scoreboard einberuhigender gap of (54 67) been notified that the host at the end of the third quarter with (57 67) beautiful.
The Alavesen last quarter blog#, and English and San Emeterio (60 75) already announced that they would not allow them to victory in the first dreiig minutes honestly earned had taken away again.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, who resigned itself to the best of their team, their team and tried not once again by three points from the line (70 77) force.
Nevertheless, and despite the Foul+s motes because the place was asked, was not on the team of Ivanovic, argued good and even though the Israelis in the last minute aufholten (85), had the game has already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time this season.

Thank you!
According to the most enticing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets was the uncertainty in the markets back again, which is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The stabilization of the market Manahme applied, it was the debt with the direct sale of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly free hand on interest rates, which is moving to zero, so that in this way Abrechnen buy assets to the banks.
The central banks have already confirmed that the Direktkäuf of assets as well as have ended and that without their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to question, to be a small bit of grit, as the BCE näc already giving respect with its annual auction, the next week.
That is why the investors doubt the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox Manahmen alive and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the differences in the corporate bonuses will rise again, even if it is still far away from the Garden of normal amounts are, which they did at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, resulting in an increase of the differences of the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been hard hit by this episode of instability, but then we had the Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a degree of uncertainty does not harm the defenders of moral hazard to silence had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy, for which an awareness of what had caused them to produce, since the devastating effects of the restriction of credit to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, it is a new day to thank beschlieen action should have been.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai on a tribal war between the emirs out for power in the Emirates and restore the development in Greece was also previously forecast.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after DurÃ£o Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the failure to meet their Auslandszahlungen+s saves and therefore a euro mitgliedsland gives its commitments, not more.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens to the need for auergewöhnlicchen Manahmen with the duty to the stability of the state money to maintain.
Yes, we are as expected from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after having tolerated some excesses to large sums of money, would now within the Erwartete.
In the case of Spain, you need not worry, as long as the differences of the public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn ethnic further increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. during the absence of a Groteil early indicators of market research institutes to forsake their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 tightening, including the OCDE and of the European Commission, which, again, with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy all the promises to come along, despite warnings not a long life span.
Once again, it seems that there is an excellent opportunity to purchase Spanish stocks, although at the moment, 'be careful driving ".

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sanchez Galán, resigned as first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where these days the strategy in relation to the supply of energy to Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, in which the chairman of Gas Natural Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, was followed by a few key points Galán the press about what he versschlossenen doors behind the subcommittee.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola Spain must 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion to invest from that date until 2030, under the promotion that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, then the needed investments to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it is no longer in increasing energy production capacity, but that it would invest in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020 will change the question and we should increase the performance.
