The lack of snow in the mountains tracasse hoteliers
Deserted tracks pose no problem to lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people book their holidays to ski in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Users travel offerings, asking price, but does not dare to commit themselves to set aside for the moment.
"And if they call us, they ask immediately if there is snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, Spindl.Info information portal operator.
If one wants to spend the new year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better is no longer too reluctant to book.
If we give priority to the economies and quality accommodation just then, then can try waiting another few days.
The hotel Špindler offer currently only stays of a week for the new year.
I think they are going to try again a time place, but they cèderont they also and accept shorter periods.
"And then the number of available rooms will rapidly decrease," estimated Jandura.
Ingtours du Vrchlabí Tourism Agency also proposes still free for all periods of winter-bed.
The week of Christmas interests us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It remains still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
"This is why we have already prepared some last minute Christmas trips cheaper," said the Director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also propose new year at Reisen, but there is less free places.
The first 14 days of February as well leave, the remaining winter trips sold moderately.
This year, winter stays relevance was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow at Reisen.
People expect that she come fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
"If tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be full," think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont to Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We are still a few remaining places for the new year for Christmas.
"There is great interest during the holidays of the Polish January and February sells well also," informs Karel Rada, Director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel close to the central parking Jánské Lázně is also complete eighty percent during the period of the new year.
On the contrary, half of beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent Hotel Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already sixty percent occupancy at the present time.
February is a little lower than at the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, stays in the Reisen relevance still certainly become indicated Omnia, hotel Director Erik Sporysch.
The Reisen hoteliers should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and there is precipitation, they should be neigeuses mountain.
But subsequently, time should heat up, informs Jiří Jakubský Czech hydrométéorologique Institute Hradec station.
USA: Repeater is the mother of wisdom
It becomes the same comic, assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, President of sage, reputation reproduces policy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he considered himself as simple.
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so strongly expected, it was copied that it it was back to carbon paper since Bush Iraqi scenario for three years ago.
Not content to use the same text several times the phrase "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of the speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech Bush: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized the idea of sending new reinforcements in Iraq consumed as civil war being Bush "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
However, the following month showed Bush policy came from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success that logs currently speak any of Iraq.
This has enhanced the reputation of Bush, it said, objectively speaking, he has left his successor a much more favourable could not expect final situation.
Barack Obama hope that Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
These again are commanders campaigns which have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander General Stanley McCristal, who has even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House in spite of the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the most favorable situation.
The President has hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, it has at least defrauded the General 10 000 soldiers.
He was able to extricate the promise of 5,000 additional on the part of Europe, even if it had about 10,000 originally.
That brings the most problems in the policy of Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this process within three years. The doctrine of Obama brings more questions it provides answers.
Many doubted that a half increase will bring the same benefits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders honour agreements.
The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - you can rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader on the day the day depending on which suits them.
Well, political institutions that officially based does remain of the powder eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is singularly complicated to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity regarding reports, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a "prompt for action state", which is the goal of basic operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama strategy makes bemused by his resoluteness.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has done worse and it is currently on the edge of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent in the turmoil of war in view of their "speedy return home" will bring a real miracle there.
From a political point of view, set a date for withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it as the American defeat indirect admission.
The last NATO Summit showed the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European policies don't know or don't want to explain to their electorate what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, Americans will meet to the very difficult issue a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It must answer for example at the time where, according to Obama, America to come to the victorious withdrawal of troops to Afghanistan.
However, each solution of this type will cause a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are still three years up to the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to spread it on a new policy, where it is révèlerait to be a total fiasco.
The Goldman Sachs Bank leaders receive more cash rewards
Employees executives high placed American Bank Goldman Sachs will receive more this year bonus cash.
The company announced in response to strong criticism regarding its wage practices.
Group of 30 major leaders receive actions instead of money, that they won't be able to resell for five years.
Actions may be withdrawn to leaders in the cases where they would take too many risks.
From Reuters, Goldman Sachs arises thus top leader of the effort to connect with performance rewards long-term on Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the overall direction that must be taken, said the old Douglas Elliott company JPMorgan investment banker
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after running aside almost 17 billion dollars for rewards on the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year total amount of premiums will exceed probably 20 billion dollars in spite of the announced measure today, according to Reuters news agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, high premiums of the banking sector has become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it had to assign a single fee of fifty percent bankers exceeding 25,000 bonus books.
France prepares similar measures.

The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota weights his stay in the Government because of its disagreement with the budget of the State for the next year as it was passed by the House of representatives
Estimated budget and perhaps Janota position with the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday appointments.
Klaus also critical budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which more hollow financial crisis.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat which has informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss its Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer function.
According the budget will be submitted to the signature of Klaus, legislation is a 163 billion deficit that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies has posted Wednesday proposals left to transfers of money and increased the rewards of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government attacked the fact that they would increase the budget deficit indirectly proposals of Social Democrats.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between left on the one hand, the Government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of the firm Fischer had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that budget, as voted by the members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Government of Fischer and that should he reduce state debt.
Klaus, who may ratify the Statute on the budget of the State, but nothing there requires, said today during a breakfast discussion with contractors, policies have long neglected "serious problem" of "irréfrénable disability" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, not favourable solution.
Only a strong Government could make an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the President.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is appalling and that the Government should affect its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said to the ČTK the idea of an Administrative Office supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly stopped working.
In its response, Prime Minister Fischer has described such "drastic verdicts" lyrics.
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted towards Topolánek, saying that prepared this year by the former Government of Topolánek budget deficit is appalling and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday, the ČSSD has qualified successful ratification of the budget of the State for the next year.
The people's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood
In spite of criticisms that the leading roles are played by American actors, the South African claim that new Unvanquished Hollywood Invictus - film will expose to the world and lot about the country, its struggles and his victories.
History speaks of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor award at the Academy, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, indefatigable fighting against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and first Black President.
Freeman said that this is a quatre-vingt-onze years old Mandela who asked him to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: "If I have embody you, I should be able to see you personally.."
72 Years old who has won a prize for his role in the Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood in the middle of the boxing drama actor has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery became itself slave, a fictional U.S. President or even same God in Evan Almighty movie but never someone still living and also important for many people it is Mandela.
27 Years, the ex-homme of South African State was imprisoned for his work in the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It has been released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
Film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and South Africa François rugby team captain to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows his country resteencore and always divided racially and after apartheid economically.
He is persuaded to join his people through sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring the history of Mandela on the big screen.
I had no other goal otherwise play this role to move it closer than reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was of course speaking like him
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, it would have tried to meet Mandela to dine with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important to him was of him shake hands.
I went when I shakes hands, I gets your energy account, it transmits and I had the impression of know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become someone else.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the master of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players in the film.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar to his home was a surprise.
"I remember when I've come to the door of the House, was opened and the first thing I have said to Francois Pienaar was: ' I have much greater air in the film".
Despite the differences between actual models and actors, under the leadership of Director Eastwood Invictus received positive notices and talking to ambitions for the Academy.
Todd McCarthy of log Daily Variety film critic has summarized his assessment in these words: "This is a very good story, a very well made film."
In films on rottentomatoes.com site assessments, Invictus received 76 percent of positive assessments.
The aura in Norway mystery is solved: the Russian testaient a rocket
It was observed a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry acknowledged yesterday have tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian border.
Launch however still was a failure and the "Bulava" missile which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of the Russian General and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its presence repeated tests of the rocket had no effect expected on successful test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava disappeared, or it is damaged in full flight.
The Russian newspaper "Bulava" as of "missile flying does not" speak
A missile which does not fly but that shines
This 13th test was initially proceeding normally.
It is at the end of the flight that was again on the equipment damage.
It is clearly the third stage of the rocket exploded that engine.
This time, "Bulava" rise of the nuclear submarine — Donskij sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely a boat moving fire and submerged
The reason why mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely it presumably was by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegian have not doubted a moment that it's a Russian rocket.
The generals contend that this time, it was not talking absolutely fails.
The first two floors of the rocket have resisted and the damage did not receive only the third.
In previous cases, engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Even if none of the test launches does went smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of defence considers that only six to thirteen were failures.
This almost fifty percent success rate thus fills the general optimism and therefore they say always that one day "Bulava" volera without problems and that it will carry even ten nuclear hypersoniques nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed a contract of one year with CSKA Moscow to 51 years
The legendary champion Vyacheslav Fetisov will present again in a professional match for 51 years.
The old world, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup champion will assist his team CSKA Moscow in need and will make entering probablementdéjà Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is currently the President of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash what we urgently need a different Defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and shall agree to help the team.
We still need a few details on the form, says the coach of club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP Agency.
It was not specified if the comeback of the legendary hockey player not only concerns a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who are capable of strengthening the mind of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.

Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
Nošovice Hyundai plant management development agreement with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that unions have declared a strike Monday emergency status.
Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai spokesman confirmed.
Management wants however still get agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked this year yet.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, it is for that that voluntary overtime have been proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz site said society has proposed a bonus of 400 Czech Crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be allocated also has postériori for the day worked 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change how to motivate employees in exchange for overtime.
They receive the supplement for more hours either, they can ask leave replacement December 28 and thus extend their year-end feasts aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all Saturday present employees will receive compensation for transport costs and their lunch.
Given that the overtime were more urgent and warmest in comments, and trade unions as employees who ceased spontaneously production last week claims point, direction decided immediately cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, automobile plant employees were forced to work almost every day two overtime with their eight hours.
Trade unions have undo state strike after signature of the agreement.
Following negotiation between automobile plant management and trade unions should take place on Friday afternoon.
Petr Kuchař union leader said Wednesday that they were ready to strike if agreement on their claims and signing of a joint document status.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when close to 400 employees began spontaneously on strike due to incessant overtime.
They were also protesting against poor pay and so-called bizutages.
The direction is defended with the fact that employees should work in addition to fill production automotive requirements.
When strike Monday announced, unions have also asked that have ceased production employees are subject to any penalty.
Unions require the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a 5,000 crowns compensation (209 € approximately) for them.
Nošovice Hyundai Motor plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production year in November last.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on the "endurants" also HIV virus
A team of German and Czech scientists tests new combinations that can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also about viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
In some cases, this reality takes top on the fact that the combination is not as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as certain medicinal products already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS today.
Can however extend radically the lives of patients through a mixture of medicines that prevent the propagation of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption causes a series of side effects.
More repression of this multiplication has the effect of what development called resistant viruses that drugs have no effect.
Experts from the three institutions, the Academy of sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg work paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes Act on protein responsible for the propagation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an Assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
This combination blocks development virus differently all medicines used until now and this is why they may overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers work leads them to discover new "enhanced" substances, based on their knowledge of their links on virus protein molecular mechanics.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
Traître and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is indispensable to the virus life cycle.
Without division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would not birth of mature infectious virus particles.
If it stops HIV protease, one stop also spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain researchers in a press release published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the e.g. HIV protease was tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants of HIV-infected patients.
On the version current enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as clinical drug, however it does not falters on resistant versions against which current medications are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique action mechanism and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are so interesting to examine more combinations to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, Director of the laboratory of structural biology Institute of organic chemistry and Biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Academy of sciences Institute.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is takes to Fischer, who defends
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek has described as "sheer" ratified for the following year and in his budget, the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question his existence.
Prime Minister called the words of the drastic verdict ODS.
He will take time to analyze.
The ODS Petr Nečas spokesman said that the idea of an Administrative Office supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party did clearly more work.
According to Nečas, the head of the Government should decide if ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to fight against the growing deficit, or is concerned to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warns that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposite.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with however proposals for amendments to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased money for salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The grievance of the Government towards the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, obedient and desire of the Government as what a modified budget is a less bad than an interim budget Variant.
Disappointment and necessary
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of necessary, Prime Minister Jan Fischer stated that the Government will still reflect the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave its functions on ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According the Czech television, Janota took appointment Monday with Premier after its passage to the Government:
At the same time he indicated that he wondered whether he would remain in his position.
Why is its disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer decides to continue to combat the budget deficit, Nečas believes that imposed changes in the budget, the ČSSD, representatives do not have their place in the Government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit as for example those that affect insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not at issue.
It is the Chief Government Fischer and the Government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing of injurious, said Topolánek in a textual release from the United States.
He recalled that some departments Deputy claim of TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas noted that if Fischer decides to resign face the fight against the amount of the financial deficit, "it is quite logical and correct based on the majority left that is currently in the House."
However, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have have not thought and once it is the order of the day then I me consacrerai, said from the House to journalists, the Defense Minister Martin Barták, elected Government rightly by Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer envolé in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS was reversing at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed along with the ODS would probably voted Wednesday against the budget amended if it had not expressly requested Democrat members allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel orphans, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS did not suffer reproaches on behalf of the President of the party in the House or in the country negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
I knew already at the point where I have abandoned my mandate that what would follow in the next months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that there was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
After new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The chemins de fer Czech will remove or restrict certain express or regional trains from December 13 less loaded and to reinforce instead some others.
Total coverage of transportation lower on the day of entry into force of new schedules two percent compared to today.
Most pricing won't, including basic rates and reduced the rate.
For example the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava that will have more links to the capital, railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
It will also less rapid trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, direct line Prague - Letohrad line is drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the greatest reduction in transportation concerns of Hradec Králové eight percent total region, however Prague and its surroundings can rejoice increased.
Two night on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line trains are also cancelled and some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line traffic will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among major transformations, you can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: at this time the inhabitants of Milovice must change Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line commuter Esko, system whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Remote lines towards the capital have their final destination at the main railway station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and Šumperk/Jeseník destination trains partiront at intervals of two hours.
Passengers will no longer take the Pendolino until Bratislava on 13 December.
The invoice this year for the regional railways: 200 million of additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of transport and shall pay railways next year in all four billion crowns to adjust visible losses, either the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for their a total eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate almost three billion.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
Railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the period was always a year.
Railways like system, which also explains that they have not resorted to an increase in price of the vast majority of the tickets.
Changes will only affect one day tickets NET ČD and internet eLiška discounted tickets.
For travellers without discount card, the net price of ČD will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on travelled route, while until there was between cities region choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
Filipino rebels still retain more than 50 persons, children were released
The rebels have removed today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers.

It reports that approximately 19 rebels have used the hostages as human shields to leak to the police.
Local negotiators now try to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to agency AFP, the rebels belong to the new army populaire (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According the AFP Agency, the police first continued abductors due to violence caused when a settlement of account between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province South of the Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the administration of Governor election it y avait30 journalists.
The Governor of the province of the southern Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential lineage of the Ampatuan.
The Mindanao Island also includes any active Muslim separatists.
They have however renewed talks of peace with the Philippine Government Tuesday.
The history of South Africa for everyone, as Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in American classrooms in the coming days, the title is Invictus (Invictus is Czech official title: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of former President Nelson Mandela South African.
The role of the fighter against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role the legendary South African Rugby Championship was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of theatrical film, return of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Nelson Mandela Rolihlahla, born 18 June 1918 at Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Prize in peace alongside of de Klerk.
He was President of the Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes as it is presented at a time where firstly South Africa is in full preparation for the Cup World Cup, and secondly because the media are agitated by worrying news to increased racial conflicts and discrimination of people in the share of the black majority in power.
After the Agency AP, reactions to the new film are rather positive currently in Africa, despite frequent them reservations towards main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is taking its own terms, proud of the film.
I've dreamed of this role for many years, and I myself am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover energy, he said of the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think that is a good thing if it has the ability to remember via film personality and message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this applies to each individual has added.
Wearing the Jersey national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel writer's British John Carlin title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part which gave its creation to the South African human rights defender depicts people during his tenure as President.
Morgan Freeman tries therefore during the film to pick up two racial groups a long divided population and similarly that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between wearing the national sudafricaine on the lawn of the World Cup team Jersey that South Africa had won then.
To will be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is considered South Africa something sacred, Mandela had been extensively ovationné fourteen years predominantly white public and was recognized by the white people.
Hope the football championship will succeed to unite people in a single nation, said Chester Williams, rugby player who was in 1995 the single "black" national team.
It remains to be seen if the tense sudafricaine situation will improve.
However, South African white are sceptical as it recently told in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, who has fled to Britain rugby fan.
The Championship began on 11 June 2010.

Jančura will complain for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will deposit today complaint for defamation against three Social Democrat prefects.
And in practice against Michal Hašek region of South Moravia against Radko Martínka Pardubice region and the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura has indicated in Dvacet Radiožurnál minut.
The complaint is related to trying to company to exploit regional railway routes in certain regions.
All regions but eventually sign long-term with the chemins de fer Czech contracts.
All three us have attacked and say that is the fine mouths, while it only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway path which is not true because we know the price of the chemins de fer Czech signed last week.
So it does us remains to defend ourselves.
This is slander on society Student Agency in Exchange, said Jančura to the Radiožurnál.
Similarly, it indicated having evidence that no region has made in agreement with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura complaint represents suite of its media spectacle that serves free advertising for his company and his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to demonstrate clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulate public opinion and uses false, untrue and arguments relating to regional railways, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement which mention unfavourable approaches regions.
He said to Radiožurnál that the campaign will stop after Christmas and it intends to resume after the new year.
He said the campaign will aim to corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions themselves are put agreed to entrust to Canadian Czech railway operation of rail links for an order of approximately 150 billion crowns, without issue tender.
According to Jančura, a way to act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of justice.
He, his criticism of rail transport in regions even led to threats of a member of the ČSSD Jančura.
The only threat was that if it is not stopped, could lose our licenses bus.
He appeared as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I will not say his name, said Jančura today at Radiožurnál.
Against the pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Against the pneumococcal vaccination renversera old habits as early as January.
It will be be the first to be free and with optional for families.
Voices are already, saying that a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against the pneumococcal busy.
Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum price that will pay insurance for vaccines.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against the pneumococcal.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If began vaccination last year or sooner, should pay yourself following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine must be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year already a quarter families voluntarily vaccinated children against the pneumococcal.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kronor in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children may require.
So far the State spent approximately 500 000 kronor per year for the vaccination of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
The pneumococcal are the cause of the middle ear inflammation but also serious infections including the inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According surveys in hospitals, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible obligation of vaccination in future.
From January, it should be settled by insurance and optional.
For example the President of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association promotes since long vaccination against the pneumococcal.
Our association has attended international conference, experts were not really satisfied that we have an optional vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to be able to impose at least this.
I think that this is a direction that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of health does not want to change the process against the pneumococcal vaccination.
We did intend it absolutely not for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of paediatricians, specialized society recognizes that a vaccination based on the volontariata its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, could consider decreasing immunization renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs one such sum I understand decision making optional vaccination" said however Cabrnochová.
Specialists provide that next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will do to vaccinate their infants.
Against the pneumococcal vaccination marks a break also that it is the first vaccination of children which is funded by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for the prevention, they économiseraient and on possible future medical care.
Physicians will need to purchase their products themselves
However, this relates to the worries of paediatricians practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving the same way as the rest of vaccine provided by the State.
However, some members feared that this would allow insurance "deduct health insurance amounts".
Thus, physicians will have to buy products and expect that reimburse them them insurance.
According to estimates, paediatricians should individually invest close to 40 000 kronor per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted to this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), elegant and well documented study on an issue that has divided and concerned since fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book of M. Bowen has a frame much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, it does wish to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that provide now in France this queM. Bozen calls of "Muslim spaces" for the 5 m - 6 m of Muslims.
He knows very well to listen to and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
Must a Muslim marry in a mosque in the Town Hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and the rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-musulman?
Can a Muslim use interest-based banking system to get a loan?
What are these practical problems, he says, are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim, born in Switzerland.
This generation is attempting to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Lesconservateurs believe in the idea of a French or European islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by M. Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers a puristic Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia counterparts which today constitute a small portion of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen estimates that values of Muslims and the French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise cannot be obtained with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how the French politicians (and the elite intellectual secularism so virulent guardian) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been coddled, with Catholics, Protestants and Jews have also had to make historical compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "Yes, but not yet."
The darker world view
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
Ice which comprised is melting at an alarming rate, taking with her a life which cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fisheries operate in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers, and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and Illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the North, the polar bear.
Appreciative of history and complicated whale fishery policies, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their hunting the White bear.
Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiration of 14 years who had to fight than the tip of his muskets, meeting certainly is a myth, but the rest is true.
The young teddy bears, captured while they nageaient along with their mother, just tuée were caught and sent in zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.

Ironically, is in the water more North of these two nations hunting that ice will remain as long.
In his new book, "after ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening Arctic Science Digest and captivating a preview of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
The atmosphéristes or the océanographes cannot accurately recount the speed changes.
It is not lack of trying.
Late 19th and early 20th, pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen travel gave early information about the melting of the ice cap.

Marines, among 6,000 people who filed crowns on the tombs to Arlington
The first class from ' Angello Robinson, 19 years, made a journey of seven hours by bus to deposit single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had ever met.
For him and the other Marines who made the Johnson Camp trip to Jacksonville cemetery Arlington National Cemetery North Carolina to decorate the Tomb, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we will be in place, said Robinson's fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, is why I try to just show of respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers in will be gathered Saturday morning to deposit on the graves of veterans, crowns in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company at Harrington, Maine, has launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill, and his wife Karen, are each year journey, stopping in different cities on their path to arrange commemorations in honor of soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded an association non-profit, Wreaths Across America (and crowns across America), which is intended to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16 000 crowns on the tombs of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, cemetery in Battery Park in New York City and the site of the Memorial to the victims of Flight 93 to United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given over $ 150,000 to purchase and carry crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years, Westminster, said that she had made the journey to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who were sacrificed to.
A small gesture that can do civilians to support our troops, she said.
This is like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitouflée in several layers of warm clothes, volunteers walked between lawns and extended hills cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old graves, dating from the first and the second world war, as well as the war of Vietnam, because they do are not also often visited that new graves, organizers said.
The mood was the optimism, while children were playing and couples stood by hand, with crowns of fresh pine on the gray tombs.
Each round Crown had a green color dark, with a small red bow on top.
Nearby, Hung silence on section 60, where most of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars emplissait area.
People cried without hide other prayed, families and friends are supported in the cold air.
Some lisaient aloud names engraved in stone while other slanted to see small information cards black and white, in the wet land for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has arrested a u.s. national distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said u.s. Foreign Affairs Ministry services.
The national, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.s. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The precise charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of "dangerous".
All activities so-called revolutionary, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-gouvernementaux graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers more large, led by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are husband and she are followed and harassed by agents of the Government.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but the him have always been denied permissions.
The detention of a u.s. citizen might increase tension between the Communist Government of Cuban brothers and Obama administration continues a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
Announcement of arrest has been first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban Government advances through concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US could make the favor.
Mobile phones and laptop computers are allowed to Cuba, although this is new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an officer is $ 15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for the text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of wage.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available for foreign visitors and luxury hotels in the country, as well as in some buildings of the Government, such as universities.
The Cubans who want to connect often must give their name to the Government.
Many websites access is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, linked from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana Press.
Berbena has said that she could not provide information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity which, in any open society, would be allowed - distribute free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, same Cuba", program referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his elder brother ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, past judgment and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably political and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, at the time where the two countries are beginning to initiate a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified a supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this matter would dismantle a network of terrorists who écument Internet for young men radicalisés recruiters organization.
Investigators said that they hunted personality insurgente hidden, known as the Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after have discovered them when one of them has been approving terrorist waves on the video website YouTube site comments.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the region remote tribal belt of Pakistan, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret service who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of al-Qaida that these men do not attending the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate terrorist network.
Therefore, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from forbidden mountains of Northeast become a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
This is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke provided that remain anonymous because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to get the entry in the al-Qaida camps where they were arrested by Pakistani forces of law.
The case of these five men - who remain in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI - emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of terrorist potential and perhaps more importantly, in the determination of persons who give confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have priority infiltrate men in the al-Qaida network.
Recruiters organization play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who show no serious commitment and those who may be be spies.
According to analysts, potential u.s. recruits are discussed by al-Qaida.
But they are also very appealing to the group because of their potential to American targets access and their propagandaire value.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert Foundation NEFA based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also be more attention, these last years in the choice of the people that they accept because American secret services have become experts in regards to their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate anyone in these groups, what better way to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is that more and more on the Internet.
Thousands of protestants at Copenhagen require "action" climate
Tens of thousands of protestants walked the streets here, Saturday, requesting a larger action on climate's negotiators in the palais des congrès Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of the demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25 000 according to police estimates.
This event was held relatively peacefully, though a few hidden activists has lit a few explosives near overview of government buildings in Center-City.
"Where little has happened during the discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations today, thousands of activists walked by city, deploying signs in English saying ' there are no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says that it has enough".
"Several celebrities joined protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the homeland of his mother, Peru, opened her eyes on déchirants problems which is facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring."
This is one reason why I decided to join the great walk - to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world that they are fair, ambitious decisions and engaged, she said.
Is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters coming too close to the Bella Center and said that it had stopped 19 persons on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of Pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters coming too close to the Bella Center and said that it had stopped 19 persons on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of Pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the discussions on climate activists who wore masks and black clothing, have on several explosives near to the main channel of Copenhagen that is surrounded by a few departments.
They launched them close to the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, then followed by "a few large explosions".
INSIDE the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around to television screens to follow the running of the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to wake up awareness of the key such as Su Wei, authorities representing China climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on the international deliberations, he answered in English "in fact, is something I didn't consciousness."
It then continued in Mandarin, declaring "the event is significant, I can't hear what is happening outside".
He observed that walking could seem harmful or helpful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or impair freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal stubborn gaps between races
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics has brought good news for the public schools of Washington D.C.
Although the district is still far behind head, the report shows that grade 4 and grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are far more great progress during the two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York institutions.
But latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (national assessment of educational progress) is the gap persisted between the results of the afro-américains and white, on both local and national plans.
Average results from white children in grade 4 (cm1) at WashingtonD.C. increased during the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their Afro-américaines classmates have increased from three points of 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Progress of African Americans in grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only to a point, 245 to 244.
The average result White has been included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overview over a period of six years is more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between black and white in grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP du district report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in the two groups increased in this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by Michelle a. Rhee and the Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) academic Group Director were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have high aggregate whereas elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that promotes equality in education district group.
I do not for a joy skips or two points earned, said Kwame r. Brown (related Democrat), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical Rhee management style, Brown said that test results message is that middle schools (colleges) of the city have desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see positive signs, and I respect.
But what makes fear, is that we do spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the district should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of classes in the elementary cycle end and beginning of College who not have integrated databases of reading earlier in their journey and school are fairly late relative to their peers.
Every day, the program of mathematics, for classes from Kindergarten to grade 6 (maternal) (6th) focuses on games and experiences of real life, as they have been implemented in the district by the former head of Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I believe quite simply that we need to continue working to provide better interventions at these lower level than the class students, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the General results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less well to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer education at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the results of tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and your management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighbourhoods in Washington.
Also this targeting may have political implications which disturb this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other Superintendent of schools, it tries to use the middle class white and black.
Our focus for the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhoods schools so that all families, regardless of where they originate, be assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one key to close the gap of success étaitla duration of traditional today of 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with Charter schools public school.
Get about 200 days to force change, Janey, which came to an agreement with the Union of its teachers a year said last for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" for even an increase in the next contract.
Make a promise for the future of higher education
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistling.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years in descends and cligne a time eye view of white columns, brick facades and verdant lawns.
Graciela parents were only able to finish high school, Salvador àEl.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring, and lives in Riverdale, had never made the feet on a University campus.
Also, while she and other students in grade 8 (4th) Group explored Gettysburg where tuition expenses of $ 38 690 per year, his attitude was less than a new impressed that enthusiastic student.
Super this is where I'll discuss! It is exclamée Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide headed them toward the entrance of the science building.
Yay, really? She says songeuse, when it reported him low right - student teacher ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh visited children in their journey of discovery of three days and now, they were completely integrated message: the question is not if you go to the University:
The question is where.
Although that this question is still largely for the large number of children born of parents Hispanic immigrants who left high school where became parents to adolescence, they are also the hundreds of thousands to receive university education that allows them to enter the middle class Americans.
In fact, "a Hispanic"second generation"on cinqpoursuit his studies at the lycée - a significant if we consider that both immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, came to the us without completing high school success."
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for following generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers who study the leaves claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set aggressive goals to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important to help Graciela and millions of children like her to come to University - in particular, if efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of the low-income families with relatives who do not experience and skills to help navigate through the system, any services, at any time, does not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied students Latin American.
We need to think about offering a network of support to these children from kindergarten to high school.
The Federal program which has funded the universities of Graciela visit is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides more than $ 300 million annually to local school systems to organize University preparation programs that start when students from low income families are in middle school (College) and continue until the end of the high school years.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering University, according to the u.s. Department of Education.
Gets the Iraqi oil Ministry deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government was able to attract significant to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty in two bids oil companies ended Saturday.
10 Agreements obtained by the Department of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, struck down by decades of war and sanctions.
U.s. companies are allocated with participation in only two of the 10 fields auction.
Seven American companies had paid to attend the second bid which began Friday.
The only one who had placed a bid was lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for fields auction in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies are European and Asian companies that pave the way, said by Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a news Web site forum.
It will take considerable time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by a coordinated bombings massifs, Tuesday, and while the u.s. military troops withdraw political instability have braked u.s. oil companies, preventing them from enter with more force in Iraq that has the third largest reserve of oil raw world, say analysts.
Companies American were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and the other energy companies controlled by a Government, labor costs were markedly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips have maintained strong links with the Iraqi oil Ministry and brought it their technical advice, are allocated empty-handed.
Lukoil and Gazprom Russian companies have been two major shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more bid on contracts of other companies and is repartie with significant interests in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major, economics as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, Ministry of oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
Companies preset to submit bids made offerings that were then compared to the price per barrel that Ministry agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, said Friday the counter-intelligence American authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murderous attack against a terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, close to the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have stated that missiles had been taken by an aircraft without driver type used by the CIA in the anarchic tribal boundary of Pakistan.
They drivers a white car, directing to Afghanistan, border when the car was under, said a Pakistani civil secret services, Member speaking phone Miran Shah.
The authority representatives reported suspicious local activists rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained "completely shredded body".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but two us anti-terroristes representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military organizers managers of al-Qaida directed terrorist operations group outside the region Afghanistan-Pakistan.
Its role was to organize and conspiracies in the world, said one of the authorities who wished remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes in Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic policies of al-Qaeda leaders and has translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second American authority representative stated that Somali had progressed quickly in the ranks of al-Qaida ' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
Perhaps it is not known of the American public, but this does not decrease as the threat is there for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, along with three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the CIA drones decreased since the summer, approximately six operations per month two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, moderated by a non-profit group Web site.
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to diminish their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The Special Envoy of the UN in Kabul retires
The Special Envoy of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted extended during the presidential elections supported by UN corruption allegations.
The departure of Eide occurs while the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN Envoy said that he supported this increase but he expressed his concern about the calendar of the us for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months, and that would require the other Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
There we must accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans, and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
Increasing military should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he does not resigned, but that he would simply respect the commitment it had made towards his family, in March, spend two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that it was time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to begin investigating my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the start of my predecessor and I arrived.
According to the United Nations representatives, ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Representatives say that Staffan di Mistura name has been mentioned; it is a Italo-Suisse citizen who has recently chaired a UN mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former Assistant, Peter w. Galbraith, it was charged, in September, encourage President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied these allegations, but said that accusations of Galbraith - who has been thanked-"have prejudiced the mission because there was already a healthy dose of scepticism with regard to international observation of the elections".
Eide said that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of u.s. forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted to the Executive Board of the United Nations that they allow successor to hire more staff from United States and other Western countries it does is assigned to the Mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence on how their money is spent.
EIDE expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy hiring UN regulations interfered its ability to bring new talent.
UN rules are such that I could recruit one person since may, said.
It is disastrous, and it can take.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "of important additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a floor of 300 American soldiers in the North of Iraq, on a visit to a week in the areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such outcome. ¨
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I learned something in Iraq in the last six years, this is the inherent war unpredictable side.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions was the military elite and politics of Iran, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also assign the Iranians Street.
"He said that a"set of motivations and punishment"might be necessary to persuade the Iranian Government that it would actually be less good security with nuclear weapons"because"its people would suffer a lot ' of these penalties."
Friday, in a declaration of the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face to "probable" consequences if it does not take back its nuclear program in full compliance with UN Security Council and its body of surveillance, the international agency of the Atomic Energy (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva, October 1, he said that he reprendrait the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its storage enriched uranium fuel Exchange desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, average develop confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears if attempts be agreed - partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided out to engage or not with us.
Frankly, I think the stiffening of Iran face some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact given their agreement to the beginning of October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese to join on what they were not intended, in terms of important additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama fixed December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, until it turns to other options, including further that the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls "of unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday, encountered the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, prior to fly to the rich oil region of Kurdish to managers of troops at Kirkuk, Kurdish, and Hawlēr derencontrer.
Tensions persist between Kurds and majority Arab Iraq, particularly concerning borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays u.s. plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates wants also to ease anxiety concerning the withdrawal pending Kurds. U.s. authorities cited Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government saying: "We préserverons your security, your prosperity and your life with a unified Iraq".
"We will leave you not."
In the aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by displays of sermonnant them propagandes, "The mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby and more, is a grave and more".
They were so well learned the lesson that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmées by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: ever.
We have already given our time and our energies to one child.
We have no second, said Wang, 31 years, Director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child in China, creating two generations of children known to be unique with good cheeks and spoiled, so-called policy "small emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, average birth rate has fallen from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy has been implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents age 60 and more explosera, of 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 at 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people age 60 and more represented close to 22 per cent of the population registered in Shanghai, residents while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (of the Shanghai municipal population and family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples had to have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
A progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, China of one-child policy is to this day, without a doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who violate this policy may have huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women a second child to an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high.
Over recent years, the public authorities have gradually snub their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule - including for residents of the cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which man and woman are already unique children - and in 2007, they have softened their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research (Research Institute for population), Beijing University, said that central Government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allow couples to have two children if a partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encourage families to have a single child were replaced by copies of rules detailing who has the right to have a second child, and how to request permission.
The City Government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, their home, and drag flyers under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although managers in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say that they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wishing to a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban district reported that there was no change.
The commune of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, is still only four to five requests per month.
Managers of Shanghai, disappointed, argue that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is always provided will be of approximately 165,000 - slightly higher in 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Committee on family planning in the commune of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, said that they adoreraient have two children, and only legally authorized.
But like a lot of Chinese, they only minimum health insurance and life given by the Government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Westerners believe wrongly that of one-child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, engineer under construction which the woman is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
It is true that it flies we lucky enough to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
This is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, head of human resources, said that it did only a single child because she was an itself. "We were family centre and used that everyone takes care of us."
"We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company says more crudely.
For couples working two, middle class, which are lower birth rate, he said, should be selfish pourbien pass.
People of 20 or 30 years grew up seeing their parents to fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have themselves this lifestyle, said.
Even a single child asks long time parents, he said.
A mother must leave at least two years of social life.
Then there are "We you must change your apartment" - space - problems and planning - "When your child has only nine months, you should write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen said, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a standard of living higher, said.
We do not make too many sacrifices.
The Group of the United Nations has plans for emission reduction projects
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN - characterized by disrupted assignments and mutual recriminations - far came under the spotlight on Friday due to publish a document outlining ambitious in the next 40 years, greenhouse gas reductions with nations industrialized supporting most of the load in the next time.
Text which could provide the foundations for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases noted obstacles remaining, as it has informed the path to take.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arrive the week next to Copenhagen.
Written by a UN special working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to withstand climate warming, course and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for keys, including the way issues developed economies and the new emerging economies could reduce their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that officials would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative of the Sierra Club àWashington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied negotiations of 180 pages text to focus on what has described the Executive Secretary-General on climate change, UN Yvo de Boer, as being "complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement would in which industrial nations reduce collectively their emissions by 2020, of 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels then that major countries developing, in the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 to 95 per cent for 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations Friday, promising to provide $ 3.6 billion annually for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the climate - change impact to withstand floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the United States climate negotiation rejected any discussion requiring gases reducing greenhouse by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of major emerging, if they were not funded by the developed economies.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder towards China that the Bush administration has been, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major countries developing, said Stern which also regretted that the text does not stress enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern has made her an hour after He Yafei Chinese Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister has declared the American chief negotiator, is lack of "common sense" comments, either was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the U.s. does not help financially China to fight against climate change.
With the economic future trajectories of major world powers involved defects appeared both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more individual economies as the rescue of the planet, with China and the US rescue querellant on their respective duties courageously while poorer nations insist that the two dozen of the most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica stated that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make large emitters responsible for their actions.
This is really a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Adviser on climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure for a forcing Treaty legally, at Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a political agreement at least.
The Alliance of small island States which includes 43 members, wrote a proposal for a Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part by what they are now unified and they ask to economies such as China and India, emerging to act.
Debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most problems pending until the heads of Governments reach an agreement.
Managers of high level such as the Minister of Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister disembarked from their aircraft and rushed in the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in huis-clos and meetings information, in order to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The true image of gathering - in which 13,000 people come and leaving the Convention Centre every day - guitar players activists have nightly performances moquant countries who felt that reveal and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by email - is a true challenge.
The intensity does that increase: almost all important ministers are here and that Wednesday not later, 60 heads of Governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering in the great court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for global Conservation International policy.
Heavy arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
AT 5 h 13, Monday morning, a whistle blow percera night to report which will mark a revolution in Britain transport train departure.
The first high-speed country commuter rail reaches 225 km/h, while it filera Ashford in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes the first train commuter Javelin outside of London.
Hopefully the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international train fast and reliable network and will link the major conurbations in the Midlands and northern Scotland to London.
Lost small holes become flourishing of suburban cities, travel times will be much less long and passing aircraft and train car will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties acceding to this project.
But the ten billion needed to build a new railway network, the battle inevitable schedule and fears of dangers to the environment may hinder British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January for a feasibility report to Government, will its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow for a detailed map of the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn in five meters from the urban area and sites where environmental impact may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres final itinerary.
It is also anticipated HS2 has three options for network high-speed more large, ranging from North.
Lord Adonis meet spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will separate into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch to West of àManchester Pennines and Scotland and other going towards Northeast, to Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option for performance ' said professional rail."
When it is finished, time travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which open until 2025, will allow all passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to currently hour trip.
Proposals will enable the train to travel to 400 km/h, making it the fastest British network world.
The initial path is designed to allow trains to 400 m in length and that can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal can accommodate 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
View science space constraints, it is anticipated that an existing station will be magnified to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks or not that the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision is not taken before a general election.
Even if it starts the machine, the network should be constructed in part by part.
Trains will first be forced to roll out of the lines at high speed on existing track North of Birmingham, retaining durations of travel between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage of aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of the rail.
Taxpayers to repay the loan of 75,000 GBP for the Orangery of the Tory
Alan Duncan, senior member of the Tory, Parliament did pay thousands of pounds per year taxpayer to reimburse the cost of an Orangery was built in his house in his constituency.

The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask 1,250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan has lost his position as head of the September, shadow cabinet after a journalist under coverage has supposedly filmed it stating that members of Parliament were to survive "on budget" after the scandal of expenditure.

I asked the direction of the prison administration to implement without delay a set of measures aimed at what this situation born of a poor assessment of the amount of overtime reoccurring in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
December payroll will be lean, except for personnel management with famous premiums functions and objectives, regretted the Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good back".

Staff do not come work on their Sundays and holidays if those October are not regularised in December, Ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône Alpes-Auvergne.
At A time where it increases our jobs and our missions without increasing our staffing, it is more that regrettable dare attacking money staff, considers the CGT-prison of Bordeaux.

But anyway the account is not found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.

Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors hospital Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection resulting from the operation of a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had réopéré the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of significant injuries resulting from this speech.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning at the lycée français de Los Angeles, where their daughter is school jade, to attend a school show, found an AFP photographer.
The head of traumatologique the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital orthopedic surgery Yves Catoné, announced that it will render Monday in Los Angeles of singer.
The producer was violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who made singer on 26 November at the Monceau Park International clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons have said that they were outrés, Mr. Camus stated.

Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "advantage without drain, nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic milieu.
It had made a few days before his death, the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, in Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he practised at the time.
In 2007, it had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a hematoma from a cerebral hemorrhage.

Mr. Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples"continued"regular" before the Council of the order, and who is "not recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday by counsel, Mr. David Koubbi.

Operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.

Obviously a resumption of 8 January tour (in Amiens, ed.) as expected, it seems very short, Mr. Camus stated.
Association UDF rising tone and sum new Centre no longer to use his initials
Association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday at the attempt to the President of the new Centre, Hervé Morin, on the initials of the giscardien, ex-parti OPA by remains no longer use it on any media, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to retrieve the acronym UDF, deeming that François Bayrou does not deserved defending his political legacy after extended hand to the left.
The Minister of defence, whose party is partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this Saturday strategy with the national Council of the CN.
To support his approach, he received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (ex - UMP passed to the CN) claiming ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to deposit it in 2004 at the national Institute of industrial property.
But Friday evening, controlled by François Bayrou friends who do not intend to leave depriving, UDF, association Office came out of his silence to start placing notice to the Minister and MP, summoning them no longer use the acronym, and they convey ownership of the mark, on pain of prosecution.
You have multiplied, these days, statements indicating that you will offer your political movement to resume the acronym UDF, written the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez's MoDem, along with Senator Jean Arthuis centrist Alliance.
You have also thought fit to follow your militant equipment and on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the new centre, the slogan the UDF today, also find signatories mail.
As know, you do you no right to the use of initials, explains the UDF Office puts notice the CN removed "immediately mention of the name of the UDF all media as well as (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "pass the property of (the) mark in his legitimate successors".
If you do not did, courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, prevent signatories.
In their email, they indicate that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had"choice" to leave in 2007"is to create a competitor, movement as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
New Center has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy).
They also remind that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an Office responsible for defending "material and moral interests" training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continues the Office, "when he filed the mark", was "more Member of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
It benefits disgracefully and fraudulently missing deposit acronym UDF to do it on his behalf.
This indélicatesse is transforming in tort, denounce they, of ironiser on the CN policy: "It seems that in politics, as in life, it is most worthy to be a name by oneself to try out of anonymity fraudulently taking a name that is not right".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be considered for abuse of weakness
Nanterre Court decided Friday to judge the artist François - Marie Banier to determine, if, as accuses it the Liliane Bettencourt, billionaire daughter took a State of weakness of the octogénaire to the spolier part of his fortune.
62-Year-old photographer known for his photographs of stars, will be held on 15 and 16 April 2010 to abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and 375,000 euros fine.
This decision means that there be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families the richest in France, where mother and daughter to shred all taking the reins of the empire of L'Oreal cosmetics.
But the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be undertaken collectively by the three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the terms proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor in the investigation.
Physicians designated Friday will have a report before March 10, 2010 including saying if Liliane Bettencourt could be located in the State of weakness and at what times.
I think that it is to submit.
I am going to talk about, said out of the hearing counsel for Ms. Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For its part, counsel of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the Court.
This is great news (...) expertise will demonstrate that it (M. Banier) has handled this old lady that shall be protected, he said.
Since two years, Liliane Bettencourt single daughter undertook actionable criminal of François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist hands-on, which it accuses of having benefited for many years the weakness of his mother to get donations in the form of cheques, EUR 1 billion contracts of life insurance or master tables.
Meanwhile, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted have been manipulated by the photographer, which it regards as a long-standing friend.
While the Court had to consider the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the argument of counsel sometimes turned to large family unpacking Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt counsel reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his solicitor, in which she said to be wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In mail dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, counsel: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years."
"Françoise, I was never able to speak to him since his marriage".
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor again believed that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a the guardianship judge refused these days to request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to act in justice, it is not under protection and has no guardian."
"No one else has to act in his place", said the representative of the Crown, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The Court finally decided to decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of enterprises towards employees, recalls the position of the companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to join contributors identified at the top "values" as it was formerly, impose consumer products designed by plant technicians.
Putting the customer at the heart of the business, marketing revolution gave the markets strategies where... Although authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences of clients come back regularly!
A demobilization employees can lead to a mortifère demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are that part tip of a much broader phenomenon which affects in particular frames.
This demobilization seriously undermines all intellectual capabilities of the enterprise, including the R
Indeed, the IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment of authoritarian management revenue expansion completely on the part of employees.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would be to put people at the centre of concerns as the client company.
Usefulness any opinion surveys concerning internal
The internal opinion surveys - as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - will encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
-Firstly because that I saw that, faced with a situation new, any structure is finally, after many of the detours, to priority... what it has always done. !
-Then, because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic vision of human behaviour.
From large engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, old behavioriste, recently reactivated by "neuroscience" états-uniennes and widely distributed, unwittingly, by research institutes and media theory.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr confirms leaders in a posture of mechanistic, inadequate governance in today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
Instead, the necessary to the functioning of modern companies managerial revolution assumes adopt a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental fact: for employees, business commitment is possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from motifonctionnelle scan adopt this design of the motivations for employees.
These studies have demonstrated that they deem their company based on a predetermined doxa enabling them through their perceived corporate image to assess what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business executives can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance", and give their human resources management "the place".
They thus create favourable concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence terrain.
Speech of Oslo: "war fair" is praise right at Obama
The right American welcomed Friday the speech the eve to Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Prize for peace 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the us.
Conservatives, who had brocardé the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for Vice-President election 2008.
I've liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, USA Today, daily Muse adding itself have addressed the theme of war "may need" in his memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing I think that Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists while there, felt.
M. Obama, who has inherited two wars predecessor George w. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of M. Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the view that the President had in Oslo "of the very good job".
I've found that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former President of the House of representatives, which has particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statements.
By some side, I have found this historic everything-in-fact speech, said Mr Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
Former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election, 2012, is said happy having seen "a President left" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they are not free and could give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For old pen reconverti George w. Bush to the Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson M. Obama gave "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting in "citizen of the world" as "it does always", "he spoke as a US President", recalling the Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security that they were not created and are not big thing to preserve", M. Gerson believed.
Among the few right to be not convinced, a Falcon era Bush, former Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, called "dull, ampoulé", and without inspiration speech on National Review Online site.
The President left, Democrat representative Dennis Kucinich is alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When one envelope war in the concept of justice, can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The press centre-left remained however complimentary to the place of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to suggest that the Nobel has been awarded prematurely to M. Obama, characterized his speech "Super-production" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide decisions international conflicts, poverty and oppression", it is burned the Daily Californian.
M. Obama "gave the speech he had", felt the New York Times, deeming it "both dark and inspiring".

The RATP stretch short of Aisne and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne - la-Vallée.

As Thursday, there has not been of cohue wharves, Franciliens is being organized.
Thus in the morning, Aisne station (Yvelines) was much less crowded than to ordinary, particularly because of the absence of College and school students.
AT Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer explained will be lifted "a 30 hour earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The station Saint-Lazare has known saturation, said the railway, which had provided guidance officers and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by SNCF to Cergy-le-Haut or coming arrived or assumed the station Saint-Lazare to join the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will take place Saturday and Sunday, which will review results, considered "lean" by trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RSP offers to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, conduct of career etc.
This is not what want drivers, who are calling a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even its proposals of premium parentheses, it is shocked the CGT, stressing that the direction "no was not dead problem is done at the road and the railway".
Another meeting is planned for "a broader examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession" Monday, said the RATP.
What did say unions that business "is moquait of the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment Committee at Headquarters in Paris.

The Turkish justice dissolves the pro-kurde party, decision heavy consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country, a decision which was immediately followed manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and Istanbul main pro-kurde party.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the Government, which just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The party for a democratic society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become a "household activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit", said to the press the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously 11 judges, while a majority of seven votes was required to decide the dissolution, said M. Kiliç, adding that managers of the party, including its Chairman Ahmet Türk and MPP Aysel Tugluk, 37 are exiled from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity had M. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury property of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave Parliament rather than to sit as parliamentarians without label.
The ruling follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, accusing the DTP to obey the "guidelines" of the Party of Kurdistan (PKK), regarded as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many workers.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the lawful political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures however that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refused to characterize the terrorist organisation and calls on the Government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court occurs while the Government has just reach out to the Kurdish community by offering a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to dry up the support of the Kurds to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had stated that a dissolution could cause an upsurge of tension in anatolien Southeast, where many demonstrations against the leader of the PKK Abdullah Öcalan detention conditions have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Upon announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, large southeastern city inhabited by the majority of Kurds.
Security forces have fired tear grenades and used cannons in water, while protesters launched molotov cocktails or stones, with some slings.
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, M. Türk stated that the decision of Justice would "deepening despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ed.) against a party, he said to the press.
The Government formed by a from the mainstream Islamist party also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
It only solves nothing, said the Minister of energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpillage democratic opening launched by the Government, political analyst Ahmet Insel said.
Can be expected, of course, a reaction of the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most devastating of recent months.
The new "Silicon valley".
For a long time it had secret city reputation prohibited Western visitors.
Under the Soviet regime, Zelenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow, was a place search secret arms, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216 000 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the commune was known as "Silicon Valley" Soviet.
Some important places of production and research in micro - and nanoelectronics are located.
September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have created links with Riedberg, rather than francfortois science - with academic institutes and societies innovations of Frankfurt (FIZ) Centre.
There was a mutual meetings and last Wednesday of Zelenograd and Riedberg representatives have ratified a "close collaboration Protocol".
Signatories were the vice-maire of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Anatoly Smimov prefect of Zelenograd to the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section for Frankfurt project manager.
In 2010 the FIZ and SMEs, representatives with a strong point of scientific research, partiront Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It's a lasting scientific exchange.
But also of economic relations.
It will allow the FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
Unlike the Russian scientific societies require contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research companies and institutes.
There are large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika Moscow, Electrotechnical Institute.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as "Socialist city scheduled" armament research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green Town") takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which research centres are located.
S21 project: a brake to Stuttgart
Cannot place enough up the scale of the project Stuttgart 21.
To his supporters is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21, is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a project of colossal construction that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in discouraging chaos yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head, with tracks that ended in full city stations were known at the time the relics of 19th century transportation which formed the modern railway brake shoe effect technique as because he had once time-consuming to move locomotives back in front.
Arrival, short stay, departure - that is that it must be.
This is why the head line stations should disappear: Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a passing train station located at halfway around on the Magistrale Transeuropéenne rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence slogan "heart of Europe".
S21 project will really begin, visions of the 1980s are more compatible long to reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost to bury railway station in the respective capitals, Bavaria and Hesse was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head line stations are more truly input and output issues since there are reversible, modern trains with railcars and car driver at both ends.
However it now launches the achievement of Stuttgart 21 next door to the new path of the cross-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is part, because it is the taxpayer costs of risk of the greatest project of the Federal Republic and non-public business.
Urban development point of view this project will leave relatively well justify.
It gets an urban space which - according to planners computer - generated graphics will be very green.
The S21 is harmful for rail transport system.
Crossing station and expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of persons to which it gave - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first concentrate on building traffic of goods for transport by rail is much more friendly environment by truck on the road.
But the new path with its gradients, not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious concerns indirectly well other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be englouits in the Swabian project.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money be missed for other junction and congestion points in the network.
List of the Department of transport mentioned in all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the good 180 kilometres Rhine Valley.
From 1987 this line is built to idle.
It would be really urgent support here for background on the head.
But the S21 project a hoof braking effect.
Route of the Rhine Valley is becoming, and international goods traffic bottleneck in the heart of Europe.
The Government looks at the judgment concerning airport
The regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government has raised the possibility to appeal the judgment of the court administrative of Hesse, concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had loaded experts to examine from the legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Tribunal administrative and which is a document which includes more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court was justified in writing that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights where the Northwest aterrissage trail from Frankfurt airport construction project able.
Attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., permission as contemplated in the Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided for January 4 if it wants to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment delivered.
The opposition critical time and tries to put pressure on the Government representative that the cirenonce to the appeal of the Administrative Tribunal Fédéral of Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel parliamentary group invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, and that was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure in a given word.
It is really difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir alluding to the éléctoral of the FDP slogan "we keep our promises".
Dieter Posch Minister rejects accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Government is attempting to still allow night flights with "avocasserie and roublardises".
It takes time for a specific legal review.
The coalition is unwilling to take a decision on the basis of fast "first printing".
Should the decision be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Interpretation of opposition regarding the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
U.s. banks reimburse the aid allocated
Large u.s. banks, very affected by the crisis, defeated their links to the State.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid fully Treasury 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to aid in the Tarp rescue plan.
Chain of American television CNBC reported of a report that Citigroup also envisaged to repay the aid received.

The Bank of Americaa launched an increase of capital through the sale of Securities Investor reported money $ 19 billion.
The rest of the sum comes from Bank funds which are properly fulfilled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday, Kenneth Lewis CEO of Bank of America held specifically to thank American taxpayers: capital injection greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The Bank had assumed its capacities in the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup intends also to obtain money financial markets to free themselves of the guardianship of the State.
The u.s. Bank could start as early as Thursday a capital increase of $ 20 billion, reported the channel CNBC citing banking circles.
Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything still happened faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking redacteur station chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already named.
The Committee wished to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin drafting of ZDF was the great favourite.
The chain did however not want - officially - confirm the vote of does not anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the willingness not more damaging to the intendant of the ZDF Markus Schächter where the proposal is not accepted by the Board.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the 9 members of the Commission on 14 vote.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter had proposed to the Board to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were expressed support for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The removal by a vote of Brender was knowing that predictable for Schächter failure.
Indeed, the CDU is majority Board had already left hear several weeks before the vote, do not want to renew Brender to his post.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of Land of Hesse, who had organized a League against the editor-in-Chief.
He had denied that the contract of very estimated Chief redacteur is extended on the grounds that listenership emission information for ZDF had fallen under Brender.
The reason for which protests were still held virtually at the vote, fustigeant the growing political influence on the ZDF.
End there even 35 experts in public law who were immiscés in the debate, and who felt that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional.
But this has served to nothing.
Peter Frey: which is?
Peter Frey was born 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied science-policy, etles Romance languages (Spanish) pedagogy.
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio authority) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became editor in first with the news magazine "heute-journal" ZDF (log today ' hui).
Then his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was writer-in-Chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, Assistant then and until 1998 he was Chief and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly information presented the morning show); until 2001 he was the ZDF foreign policy department head then head of the Berlin editorial.
After the disgrace of Brender, while it had be elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium magazine, the Greens have announced that they deposits a constitutional complaint
The opponent of the Board, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, Koch said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF intergovernmental Treaty so that intendant staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the personalities of boards of ZDF monitoring policies.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manœuvré of the Board in criticising the commission vehemently in its decision of limoger Brender.
Through this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to offer for writer-in-Chief without losing face, and that the Board could elect him without it the soupconne place to position a political supporter.
In arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Large cleanup in academic studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike of education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder Ministers decide to show more conciliants: during a meeting between Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the Bachelor or Master students working conditions should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They particularly began to accordpour lighter weight examinations: a single examination should close the module of study chosen.
In addition, workload should be reconsidée to ensure "acceptable and realistic proportions".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to organize more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, it should not be different regulatory from one State to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of education of the Länder and rectors of universities have constantly to mouth fashionable expression: "étudiabilité".
But first, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
Accreditation Board decided to considerably reduce the number of certain examinations: "each module should normally be held by a single examination", can be read in a document thirty pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of accreditation declares that significantly reducing the workload of examinations should be able to stop the skids, which greatly interfered with the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should also be, in future, the decisive test organization of studies.
The modules all as the background should be examined carefully to see if it is impossible to avoid this feeling of choking sometimes we feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - based on past knowledge of RAID to Kunduz, opposition believe the Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) Defence Minister is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the ability and the margin of flexibility to allow and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will affect access to the new university cycles but also will be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means however, that this is that by 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 accreditation competent agencies throughout the Federal territory created by the Länder Accreditation Board-dependent.
In October, the Ministers of education had exercised some pressure on the Länder so they weigh on agencies so that the programs are not too loaded and not too strict examinations regime.
In certain Länder, universities and specialized colleges already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only State to have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, the universities must organize tutorielset programs strengthen educational guidance as well as the examination offices and international relations service offices
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million for this.
Early 2010, the Government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Due to this it more will need to pass a single review to complete his studies.
Organization of studies should be more flexible, more must be able to ensure the recognition of transcripts of other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, l "étudiabilité" of all university cycles have been examined.
Last Thursday, the Government and the opposition again discussed the issue conditions studies in the country.
Décisionsont been popular but criticism made themselves heard.
Federal President of the union of Socialist students indicated that he would like that the Organization of the educational policy will happen more in the future "behind closed doors" with Ministers and rectors of universities.
Later after the educational strike students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
Future diplomés higher education it received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students we is useful" she said Thursday in a meeting with Ministers of education of the Länder with the HRK is working on a joint project of reform.
For the Trade Union of education and Science (GEW) Bonn decisions do not go far enough. It calls for the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to sign up for a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller Steering Committee member of the GEW request also Länder provide today's undergraduate students, there will be tomorrow enough seats for Master studies and studies as well as possible conditions.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of education have not raised the possibility to ease access to the Master.
More than a footnote at the bottom of the page on Herta Müller
It is through these words "arrival in Germany and is beautiful, almost more control...". "that begins a work of Werner Söllner, poet where he thématise in snippets of troubling phrases, experiences a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost with its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first Professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, Director of collection in a youth Publishing House before settling in Frankfurt / Main.
Söllner has received various awards; in 1993 he was the coveted Chair of poetry of the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he is Director of the literature of Hesse Mousonturm artist home forum in Frankfurt.
He made many mention him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, in a Conference in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania" in the mirror and the mirror tweaking your Securitate folder.
Clearly unstable and shy, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before its germano-roumains writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer colleagues that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the German language together with some of the participants.
Tests of enlistment had insidiously started in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "someone who has not sufficiently known resist auxessais intimidation of the Securitate.
Werner Söllner poet is reporter Walter (Walter IM).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his best literary conflict with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular community of Romania, originating in German authors by a case that clearly shows abîmes and especially a system policy, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as to say according to current knowledge, not only convicted but deceased.
In its own folder Securitate, IM Walter played a role, provides specialist Michael Markel literature after the confession of Söllner and returns it to the positive influence of IM Walter had intercédé in favour.
"He had drawn from every difficult situation at the time", according to Markel.
Markel has felt the moralde need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made its Declaration and before the public was unexpected, however admission a former dissident of its cooperation with the Romanian secret services is indeed not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages in its own folder.
It can be assumed that victims have been speculation and will sometimes guessed what actual names hid last names Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowing.
Instead of Germany where Meanwhile consultation of the Stasi records is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate folders is still very confused.
Systematic clarity has been constantly frustrated and braked in past years.
It is in 1999 that a national Council for the Birthler institution created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the folders has instead dragged from.
There are since 2005 a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by the interview with a former manager of the Temesvar Securitate who, after the delivery of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, is expressed very dédaigneuse way to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately it does had queried it only once.
The stigma of power was thought to be expressed here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, many questions inéluctables associated where Söllner as happens so often in a context of hidden conviction.
Why now? Who has been spolié? Weighted response from listeners, to the admission of Söllner, leave hoped that later in this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge by charges and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote at the bottom of the page.
Uproar in the Champions League
There was the impression that a representative arrived here, drawn four coming straight pins of a nice Christmas, where sporting goods manufacturer had spread its goods when the new coach of VFB Christian Gross monta midnight feast less quarter in a Mercedes class C, that it had just call a handmade provider orange plastic bag.
The man, whose skull chauve drew attention, let himself be driving in town that he was still foreign.
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could take himself flying - he only had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk nor happiness.
He spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow he had to return to work.

The "" great work"awaits us Sunday."
Here, it's repeat the everyday champions League results in Mainz.
Need to overcome the weaknesses that have rebuilt surface after three expéditifs Marica goals (), Träsch () and Pogrebnyak)
Draw
The eighth finals of the Champions League (game go 16 / 17)   23 / 24 February / return match 9 / 10.   16 / 17. (March) will be chosen by lot 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the commencement of fulminant successor of Babbel was moderate.
And joy not was not moderate only at one that brought luck, which had passed to déstabilisés Stuttgart, a motivation flawless and the pleasure of playing professionals.
I have been see players and I told them they were to focus on their strengths, advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so bienmais that was more effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, avowed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel-, "in the foot when there is a new pulse happens sometimes things that one would have ever thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the player through its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" recorded by a proverbial "fresh air" and the working method of the new leader: "This is someone who is taking action and requires discipline."
"This is what we need in the current situation.
But apparently Babbel in had failed.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed Cape, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs mainly tenacity.
Just as Gross, players and the manager will keep well of surévaluer victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before to have had four days later a bad clock to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, manager, himself that they were well achieved one of the goals of the season, but they are other remained far.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
Heldt its 40th birthday does not have the heart to the feast, even after the first victory at home for three months, is the events of the weekend in a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, contrecarrait Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had charged the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change a coach under pressure of pubertaires fans.
Lehmann was also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele that his day of free games after it was deleted.
Lehmann statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" enfonça Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without prior work by coach replaced group, strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large share in the success" rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann chorus - and even the man in the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight at Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger caused ever verbally and gestuellement Vitali Klitschko world champion.
But after 12 rounds difficult the Ukrainian defended his heavy after version Federation WBC world champion title.
A unanimous decision of the judges is imposed in points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retains its title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on the night of Saturday 38 years champion had won a victory points to the judges against Kevin Johnson (120: 10) American unaminité.
For the third time Klitschko defends his title from his comeback on stage in October 2008 with honour.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the federations WBO and WBC world champion title.
Unfortunately he failed the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, came out winner 39 times in 41 Professional fights, was twice its defeat due to injuries confess.
The Johnson challenger has of accepting his first defeat at the 24th fought.
In the Bern arena before 17,000 spectators, large Klitschko especially wanted dictate the combat, the top of its 2,02 metres, by its left against.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller before the duel, had announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid strokes champion, empéchant thus Klitschko to come into play against his right dangeureuse.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried moving the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko words and gestures in its shots reached only very rarely champion.
It is still the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, a have exceeded with Klitschko distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had lots of noise in the Swiss capital before battle.
It insulta Klitschko traitant "vile zombie" "is not really capable".
During the Friday weighing, champion could not refrain from causing Johnson him doing down his sunglasses nose "in order to see his eyes".

"I've just taken a blow in this fight and am in perfect shape" told Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His rève is trying to unite the four most important titles in family.
His brother Wladimir is federations WBO and IBF champion.
But British David Hague who, having large Nikolai Walujew-2,13 détroné meters - in November, is the WBA belt.

It would seem that his company promotion plans now play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz affair
Frontal attack opposition: head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of defence Guttenberg lie in the case of Kunduz case.
The SPD and the left (die Linke) parties ask Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examination of the latest information on air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has complained to the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "formulated an untruth" on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday in the issuance of the ARD "Tagesschau" (8 p.m. log) string information.
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the international force in Afghanistan (ISAF) security assistance.
This is, in substance, the content of the report available to NATO, and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, lafrappe lens consisted of reality, not to destroy the stolen truck, but was good to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According a report of NATO, 142 persons had been killed or wounded in the American aerial attack which had been launched at the request of the Colonel Goerg Klein, German military of Kunduz Commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have prayed Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as soon as possible to the Federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of Renate Künast Greens Party are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must state clearly if targeted massacre policy is part of Afghan Government fédéralet policy if the Chancellery, military and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejected these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant to the return of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, real reasons as this had been presented by the Department.
According information log SPIEGEL, the information that they had given to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of NATO's report and hidden some clumsy details to the Minister.
In the entourage of two senior officials it is yet suggested that they have informed the Ministry of defence of the existence of several reports, including a Colonel Klein as a military police report two-page document.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, it did not answer
Saturday, the Department has not wanted to comment on these charges and returned to the Board of the Federal Parliament was to constitute the next Wednesday to dapporter light on the facts in question.
The dream worlds
Some see, while awake, pictures and hear voices that no one else sees nor does not intend to.
There is not only among psychiatric patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between reality and imagination blend.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going well.
When we are long in our assombries rooms, we indulge us unfettered wildest fantasies and dreams.
However one, awake, experience of dream, status and sees things that others do not perceive means soon has the reputation in our West to be mad or drogué, or at least be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear among psychiatric patients or under the influence of drugs.
This is our imagination is concerned: it is the same neuronal activity enables us to design houses, painting tables or write novels, but sometimes inducing the boundaries between dream, madness and reality will melt.
A State of conscious wake, taking the form of a dream might be forms the most diverse in the best case it is called visions, the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are distinguished, visions of mysticism Hildegard von Bingen, the Prophet of the new Age Carlos Castaneda, seconds States drug experiences chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when equilibrium, brain - first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and the achétylcholine - neurotransmettrices substances breaks and interaction between different parts of the brain is affected.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts arise very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Terrestrial attraction force no longer has power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awake; Wilhelm Griesinger, was one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and the dream", for Sigmund Freud dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions, and sensory illusions that it".
We are in the autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional loud colours.
The terrestrial attraction has more power to him, it hovers at the wave of the ceiling.
It feels a coup.
Behind him Devil creatures winged, grimaçantes, ensanglantée, showing teeth mouth.
They pursue it, give him kicking foot with heavy dazzling boots, they throw it against the walls, it feels pain throughout the body.
Tonitruantes, méchantes, voices howl, unrelated to the walls and the radio.
Can no longer have to bear these voices who insulted him and it humilient.
Henning t. snatched two his stereo cables, actually a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It mounts on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck.
It jumps.
The loop stands.
That this serve you lesson, shout the voice in a choir to him pulling the tympanum. "Va in a clinic and do you treat!"
Today Henning t. 40 years, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective, paranoid psychosis, moreover it is maniaco-dépressif, it takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During psychosis I lived the terrible fears and deep despondency.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
A percent of the population suffers from at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in clinics psychiatric is the most frequent disease after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the persons concerned can no longer distinguish between inside and the outside world, they find themselves in a State of hyper excitation, who may suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voice that dictate, which comments or who converse.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned cannot distinguish between the important and the insignificant, brain cannot filter disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks a tidal ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation at a meaning centered on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, as in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is the reason why people with schizophrenia feel often threatened, controlled, and handled.
Generally they do not have the ability to adjust reality illusions are a cruel reality, wake is excluded.
Experience once in his life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, as Fuchs, "sensory and spatial reality which is collected during psychosis, structure is fundamentally preserved".
Thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of the lived in a real context.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles, is still a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everything everyone to temporarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins showed that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers assume that the persons concerned are fine lesions.
It assumes that neuronal brain maturation is disturbed at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained rest, is how the fault occurs neural system and also the fact that it does not occurs for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, but if there is a predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs may trigger some psychoses because they affect the neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
Which is crazy, we said psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the psychotiques suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to will undo while others buy very expensive for to get drugs.
Pleasant or unpleasant illusions perception is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten gathers for ten years reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are well typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses, but also a number of impressive for many other diseases.
It is among these psychological disorders as the borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, sclerosis, Alzheimer or the injury disease.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even brain healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally suppressed.
They take shape when dealing with sensory perceptions, brain areas are not sufficiently refrénées or hyperactives; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like a brain injury or a psychosis.
But the lack of stimuli, stress, love chagrins or other exceptional mental States.
In recent studies, one third of participants recognizes have experienced at least once in his life a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah k. has 16 years, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg and Pomerania earlier, and she goes to high school.
A young girl everything to normal indeed.
If there was no images and voices.
During recreation, he arrives as a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, her address speech.
When she meets him his comrades watch, surprised - anyone else sees nor does not intend this boy.
They think that this timid girl is a lunatique rêveuse but Sarah K does not dream, she is certain.
She is awakened, means and sees this boy just as she sees and means the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even collect its presence temporarily.
It is a pleasant feeling, it is this young friendly.
Am I insane?, wonders t - it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real, and they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are generally, scary.
Often the visions are so.
When it is in class, sometimes it can take the course because the Professor is just being present a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and that the Professor is clearly explain equations to the table.
At night the appearances are generally, scary.
When, in the darkness of her bedroom, it expects sleep arriving too seldom and far too late, it often cannot distinguish if she is awakened or dream already, if the images it sees, grimacing faces or the girl with sanguinolentes gouges on the arms and legs are before its eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, cries out t - it to these creatures.
It does not tell his parents or friends, they take it for a Madwoman.
Autumn 2009. Sarah k. is now 20 years old.
She had her tray last year and saw with his friend.
A year ago hallucinations ceased.
Since it came into contact with the psychologist Kasten Internet she knows very well that it is not mad.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or insufficient stimulation, the probability is high that hallucinations for some time.
I assume that the brain is not quite busy, is such that there is the animation.
Sarah k., single girl was afraid of other children when she was small, and often played itself.
His hallucinations began when she learned at age 13, that the man she called papa, since it was age thinking, was not his real father.
Are the same brain areas that are active for Visual and acoustic, hallucinations and impressions and sounds real, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "occurs in the brain, the reality is formed from there."
Hallucinations are also formed in the brain images, this is why they seem so real."
Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally differ from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike people with schizophrenia, mentally healthy person is able to recognize the fantasies are not actual images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients of treasure hallucinations as a special talent.
There is a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too centered on consciousness tends unfortunately soon make imaginary experiences for pathology, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and head of clinical Psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital doctor Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious and painful illness, but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of so-called oniroïde, a particular form of éveillée by the dream consciousness changing experience.
Oniroïdes experiences are of very complex semi-rêves which are perceived as real by the person who lives and it can differentiate the same dream when he is in the waking state.
State of consciousness oniroïde occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme as patients with diseases of polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience of motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by loss of self and world, due to total and sustainable incapacitation move, it replaces this actual situation which affects his life by his own fantasy world that is separated from the reality.
It is a State of mental limit between dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the reality is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact intense form of means and interpretation, a situation itself unacceptable, an organization that is given us capacity men, for not descend into the void of unconsciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Peter Cornelius Classen, historian of art Zurichois also describes its oniroïdes experiments in his book "Change of heart" as the soul backup action.
It has 49 years, at the time where his conscious hand for a trip of several days after the operation a followed by heart valve transplantation; during this time, his body is sentenced to stand in resuscitation.
Claussen immersed in a world he created from scratch, foreigners, travel site visit in time. He sees in old man alité in a sanatorium railway, a robot to his bedside ensuring on his health.
He lives in the medium age among the nobles who manufacture blood-based drugs.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle that takes it in his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the névé of Alps and encounters a Korean mafia.
It absorbs it completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream.
The dream is a completely different State, he wrote describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mentally travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real life experience.
The intensity of this experience is explode the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions oniroïdes, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how our internal representations of the external reality are fragile in sleep state.
Any change of consciousness, summarizes the Kasten psychologist "may cause distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be also very rewarding.
First snow can fall
Burda
AT age 27, children will take home publishing suite.
The appointment of Kallen to President and CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: longer-term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take the press group, he said the Spiegel log.
The holding company must remain 100% family business.
Hamburg - A long term, Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
Two children will inherit 27 years and are firmly determined to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69 years, to the Spiegel.
Details were resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company later arise.
We must also see if they are able.
It cannot impose its children 7500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with.
This démolirait children as well as business.
Burda did know last Thursday that it removed the President-Director-General post since January and his successor was Paul - Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is member of the Board since 1999.
It was first responsible technology sector.
Subsequently he looked treasure sector that is to say that it was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, foreign industry, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time is not a member of the family who is head of Burda editions.
Burda children respectively have 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who would now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
"Kallen nomination is also used to make the link 10 or 15 years"
Burda States that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins were still held in families that are left will result in a capital, bulimia have been huge unfortunate speculations, believing they could climb above.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had a universal power rêvede, Burda said.
Do I have absolutely not as Preceptor of the country as could be Springer and I do not intend to participate in these international leagues such as the Time, these companies have taken far too much.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it's a device that can only watch his email, without the opportunity to do would see certain types of attachments or Web surfing.
It took her five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine appoints it as a product of the year.
In truth, it is harder to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers very low priced and a monthly subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, the subscription data to the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, one with a free service data to life, to six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its American big-brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes the roaming throughout Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what represents due to waive the data when it crosses a boundary or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a Fon connection) in order to check his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and done long should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as for me, I will need to have a theory in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
Reminders to order repeated by the European Commission to provide affordable roaming throughout Europe had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside his country of origin, is reluctant to use the data, and it is not wrong.
A small device such as the FonPeek (it always curious that it's called Fon while he lacks the WiFi) offers this type of rates, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals to maximize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes download papers and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
It's a connected device and it pays for their purchase and each month.
And that is what I hope one day to the FonPeek: option to buy with access to life as Peek already proposed in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I want simply because I believe that is a formula more just for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle is preferred color
Yellow is, without doubt, color preferred the first lady of the United States.
If it came to making function Barack Obama to the Presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat color, it has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of his life: discount in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a very similar model on these two occasions: addition ressemblante colour, a yellow to green with bright reflections, pulling the twice, holding consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the mantle in the same tissues, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So although a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States to follow the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to deliver the same outfits.
But the tissue in which both sets are carved makes them very different.
For function making it was a thick lace, however, it was Oslo a printed velvet.
Accessories are also different: Green shoes to average heel for the first opportunity, and a similar, but Golden, model this time.
The hairstyle she also changed: hair are now identified while them was released, causing the last time.
75% of working mothers were professional problems due to their maternity
The discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young people who want to be mothers.
That reveals "Fertility and career women in Spain," study conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women 15-75 years, leaves no room to doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their professional career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning early life in torque and the number of child, if the woman is working or not and busy job type.
Those who do not activity outside the home, part-time or have little stable work, begin earlier couple have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children.
However, women with a stable employment, mainly in the public sector, repel entry into life pair and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Between 35 and 49 years having a fixed working women have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after will be installed in pairs. This figure is 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable employment have needed more time in their life for it, which led them to push the union and the arrival of children".
"Moreover, type employment exercised influence largely motherhood, but less common life starting date", says the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The educational level is another factor that widening the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the training level is high, more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintains among women a same generation.
For example, in the group having between 35 and 49 years, those who were elementary and higher studies respectively were mothers first 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"A different disctinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education."
"Then only those who have made basic studies are married and have their first child to find stable employment, those who have done studies of medium or higher reverse this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child", says Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L'Oreal Paris has just added a new name in its list of Ambassadors jalousée: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress demonstrates multiple products of the brand image entonnant universal currency "because I well vaux.
Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant of the international scene, actresses protagonist is thus joining other celebrities listed at L'Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.

Men's brand of cosmetics account also luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
The British fashion Awards
The British have much say in the world of fashion.
Its major representatives, designers and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual discount prices, which took place in London at the Royal Court of justice.
Person breached the appointment.
The ex model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger elected best model of the year.
Poker ACE Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer (Alfaguara, Fernando Vicente illustrations) æsir thirty "x-rays" writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his life).
It does not as predictable and arrested genera (biographical summary, life and work), but looking for something similar to the kernel of ignition created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent keeps the fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation reads and replayed.
I leave here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse that even that I ressentais without name: pleasure against the baleful destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without no God.".
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihiliste, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, devoid of meaning, as the blade of the knife that was nearly kill him.".
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman passion which lasted 13 years, in the flesh which he conjugua emotion of adultery in the pleasure of remord, a spiritual privilege which was to reach the sky by the path of perdition.".

Itself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner County and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were quantity. »
On Louis - Ferdinand Céline: "this writer whenever the mad cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to bear its ECHO to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did in the brain itself and by invoking the postériorité with a violent speech to the maggots.".
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she began to knees and prayed:" beloved God, I beg you to do that I no longer write like a woman. "

A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years, is promenait in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent in next to it and our dog, a blood-mélé, rescued the spa and weighing not more than six kilos, and without saying a Word, they assenèrent him two his legs laid the seriously injured dog.
Our indignation is immense, because we do not see that there are fun to abusing free small defenceless animals which, moreover, was on a leash.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who will quietly promenait and that, when it only injuria these individuals, in arrived to fear for his physical integrity, since a énergumène attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man, or ultimately anyone smaller than him.
The episode took place to 17 hours, Tuesday as another, in a usually quiet area.
The dog gémi all day.
We have of course filed complaints at the district though we doubt that this serves to much and do not touch the sensitivities, we want to just specify the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is youth so they are fun free abusing an animal without defence gives us love, friendship and US company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people is passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the headphone port
The manufacturer Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage port headphones, mainly among the young motorcyclists as indicated today two structures.
This initiative is intended to raise awareness of the importance of the headphone port because it is the only element of protection to prevent injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that this campaign was in the lineage commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of always safer products" and said that she contributed to this objective by other actions educational and informative nature.
This new campaign encouraging port headphones in two wheels, with the motto "to be or not to be", will include a phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the enterprise, because as a manufacturer of tyres for vehicles with two wheels, one of its main objectives is always safer products.
Advance sale of light commercial vehicles
After almost two years, light commercial vehicles market begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
9 425 Vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the figures management Union manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
It should however be qualify good news, since the reference used in the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Accordingly, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if one adds all vehicles falling within the category of commercial vehicles light (derivatives of passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and trucks to Lightweight chassis) 95 853 were sold.
Large clouds that affect most asked are for all dissipés. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, more restrictions involved by the limitation of bank credits, should add other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation, and unlike the passenger vehicle, aid for the purchase of the 2000e were little used.
In addition to consumers, the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a carbon level that exceeds the 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit from, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it again recalled the need for the administration attach special attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
Dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, it calculates a drop of 19% sales (tourism and 4 x 4 vehicles).
The emergency aid is now mandatory
As this occurred with the ABS the ABS brake system and this will take place with the ESP stability control, help emergency braking systems constitute a mandatory element in European cars.
They are also already required on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a grace period has been set up to end February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union has to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if by its mode of action, it can also help avoid many rear shocks.
The wizard to the emergency brake is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintain pressure until the end.
According a study by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car, one third of drivers involved in an accident could not press brake before the collision, and half of them had taken advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires maximum brake system reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
After a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of items up to 1,100 fatalities that pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of intelligent emergency braking systems said: calculate that a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is fitted with a system which, thanks to a camera or a radar detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, help by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it doesn't, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercise maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
GM pushes the plan for Opel in January
While the Opel de Figueruelas (Zaragoza) factory workers have been notified by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the Meriva new production would be launched during the first week of April - probably 8-, after Javier Ortega, American manufacturer has advised that it will need for more time to conclude the emergency plan of Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan was approved by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted workers and Governments of countries where plants, be postponed until early 2010.
However, at GM, ensure that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has tightened pressure on American manufacturer quickly so that a decision more.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sportscar Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, grows.
Where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab Baic Chinese company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster s and succeeded in amincir it of anything that less than 80 kilos, leaving balance only 1 275 kilos.
This has led to happen, firstly, automatic roof was replaced by a manual bâché roof to reduce 21 kilograms, using aluminium as the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the 64-54 litres fuel tank doors 7 kilos of earned at Mount bacquets sport, yet 12 kilos, and with lightweight 19-inch tires five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced to the audio system CDR-30, winning six other kilograms and replaced the doors poignéesdes by handles woven, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model are also using the PDK dual clutch, test was conducted on a six-speed manual box mainly model on secondary network of California mountain, with particularly tortuous turns roads.
Its behavior can be described as an impeccable.
Weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the floor with overhanging.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light which, at the same time, guarantees provided security in turns, including high-speed.
This is a small athlete, able to warm up its musclesà small speed during time, until we ask him sprinter, curb, retrieve, and again push its engine...
This is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also forthcoming States, car make what will indicate our hands on the wheel.
And it will do with surgical precision.
Sound engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option, or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether stationary or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard and uncomfortable.
Coating the road we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was sufficiently damaged, but the car well managed hen nests.
Electronic wizards were barely presence throughout the journey, Act while on some turns we found the ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, ultralight car more entertaining to drive, which is much more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.

But in this game, despite the fact they were on track to break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind that of Vitoria, that it does not so easily WINS on their land, and through "the hand of Elias", they succeeded in entering the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively that yellow take advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic, players injured but far from being dead, needed to some skillful to take air actions, and it is at this point that arises the Mirza Teletovic mitraillette, with three baskets to three consecutive points and using English and Ribas gave the counter to a score reassuring (54-67), and the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quarter-time (57-67).
The team of Avala was released to play at all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) avisèrent did tired person they take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team does not résignèrent and tried to support three points (70-77) line.
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for typos, Ivanovic players do not précipitèrent, défendirent, and although the Israelis are reconciled at the last minute (80-85), part was already played and victory coming in Tel Aviv for the first season.

Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, in which asset inflation was the dominant note on markets, uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where officers make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy employed by central banks to stabilize markets was monetizar debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving abundant rates close to zero, liquidity to financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalised, and without questioning their liquidity, non-conformiste policy begin to put sand in the inner workings, as did the ECB with their award for one year next week.
Therefore, investors doubted global economic capacity to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are currently attend one vice versa the reduction of risk premiums.
Volatility of scholarships and differences of business obligations increases again, although they remain very distant paranormal levels that they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialize the risk of private and public debt is again assigned.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were sanctuaries selected by investors, causing an increase in the differences between euro area countries and Germany.
Spain has barely been touched by this episode of instability, but then standard
Other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who were trying again cause a case of conscience at lesresponsables world economic policy that had held back the destructive effects derived from limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, then what should be done is to enact a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal fight between the Emirs to restore its place in power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A Government that conceals a deficit, elections, and a new Government that discovers the pot at the roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary for a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and enables a euro area Member countries do not abide by its commitments.
However what is logical, it is the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and render its coresponsables citizens of the need for extraordinary to maintain its financial stability measures.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardisation of transitional risk premiums after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In Spanish, as long as our differences debt increase measurement companies European, nousn bonds where ' not have to worry about.
If the European goodwill decreased and ours continued to increase, it would be then a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The standard case
Again, this has any air constitute an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish, assets even if "caution is currently parent security.
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the Subcommittee on the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days above the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.

To the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million in 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030, where today nuclear power plants in operation would remain open.
If such is not the case, the necessary investments will amount to 60 000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be devoted to increase the production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, question changes, and it will be necessary to increase the power.
His bet focuses on both stations to gas and coal, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, especially, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW are more necessary with with other "energy support".
Galán, who believes that the draft Act of sustainable economy that the Government has approved is in line with what calls for his company, did not want attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to fight against climate change.
According to him, there is "a clear bet long term" in this sense, despite "one-time", as qualified them the Iberdrola Chairman measurements.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are located on the long term, should start to be taken, because they put some time prior to reaching maturity, and that a stable pay framework is needed to address them.

The workshop involved is a tunnel estimated 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, tunnel that is option to allow to settle in the country as a dealer of highways and public works company Acciona.
The Mayor of the city wants it in to end 2014.
After choosing the collaboration of public / private (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, in a case under the tutelage of Erns plan

ACS has only just win a place on this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.

Their participation in the UEFA Champions League reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League became a source of income for clubs, since its inception in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and Barcelona F.C. won 467,4 million, which puts third and fifth clubs that have pocketed the more money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Win the UEFA Champions League provides not only the glory. It's also one of the main sources of income of large clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362,5 million EUR 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in 1992-1993 season according to UEFA information.
The F.C. Barcelona and Real Madrid have been well served in this distribution.
White club was the third of the continent to receive more money for its participation, and the only one with A .c. Milan, has won three times the trophy.
Catalan, current club taking the title and the last winner of former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, the two teams which, Furthermore, have charged the more money for their last Champions League participation.
And it, although they have lost to Barça.
Furthermore, Spain is only the third country with regard to money reported by League champions, although she has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won by four, three England and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1 090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will devote 413,1 million fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who attended games classification (among which the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each fought match.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those arriving in first knockout round perceive three million each, eight teams arriving in quarter-final reçoivent3, 3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion WINS 9 million to 5.2 receipts by the other finalist.
Thus, title fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and up 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million to have won the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are payments variables, which are 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attitrées seats.
The previous year's champion WINS 40% allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the editing of the current year.
