No liberating for Tymoshenko novella by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request, as part of a revision of the Penal Code those paragraphs, on the basis of the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted.
The new rules, paving the way for the release of the imprisoned would pave Expremierministerin rejected the Members in the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was in October due to the conclusion of a supposedly adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
The sentence has not yet been, in December, the appeal of the convicted man before the courts.
Timoshenko self-described the ruling as a political revenge of the regime, and also in the West, the process the suspicion of bias of the court.
The amendment to paragraph 365, on the basis of the Expremierministerin sentenced to remove from the penal code, was backed by 147 Members.
226 votes would have to be approved.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows their losers.
Muammar al-Qaddafi is due to an unknown location buried in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now, only the winner.
As usual, this region Islamists triumph in the elections, the only question is what - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council is known for the common law of Scharīʿa, which we are now has some idea of God.
Libya would the country without crime, because for theft hackt it in short the hand.
Women should also think of emancipation quickly forget any religious renegade are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the company from each other in future feuding tribes united by the Koran.
In short, in Libya will be an order, which almost inconceivable here and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively, probably not the best and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.
In this respect, it is rather surprising that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help at all.
In their defence, may well serve only the fact that NATO's bombardments not by any General from America, but from Allah self-guided, whose omnipotence after every successful hit was praised.
The winner in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We were only in a gun, served the interests of Islam and reasserted our politicians in the hands of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more of a military occupation of Libya.
This is a concern going on here - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
The oil companies but also without occupation of the black gold to the silver price?
Hardly, and so can the West once rightly his selflessness in protecting human rights boast.
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa-representatives.

The menu of a fat addicts child: It does not eat the evening frühstückt sausage and bread
More than a third of children between 9 and 13 have problems with obesity, with 9% of all pupils and 5 percent of children are overweight.
Current polls - obese children usually come from families with ungesundem lifestyle.
It shows once again how important for the healthy development of people the milieu in which he now and the examples that surrounded him.
On the tables adipöser children sausages until half more on the table, as in families where standard algae important children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the Enlightenment action under the slogan "obesity is no coincidence" Pommes for supper.
In families with thick Chen also include sports is not one of the favourite activities, but also the majority of today's students, only 15 percent said that their parents are at least once a week to find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The poll was held last year at the end of this academic year, there were nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
It was the second year course of action "obesity is no coincidence" that the general health insurance fund and the company Unilever.
So far, the project took more than 12 thousand pupils from 4-8 classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity.
"Only half of the surveyed children, for example, five times a day, in the mode breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-Vesper-evening bread to eat - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for supper
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as the regular breakfast time of family, important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic early pieces but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families frühstückt alone.
Worst of all was the observation that in every tenth family is not eating any breakfast.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of healthy daily diet.
The poll test, among other things, on the day that the families of overweight children more often unhealthy Pommes consumed.
And almost everyone, without regard to weight - drink every day sweet soft drinks (70%)
While driving more than 40% of the surveyed children sport, but less than half of their parents do, only 15 percent.
Deputy dir your own menu together
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and girls from 13 schools) 172 out opportunities offered to appetite and view their own menu together.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of food, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and, of course, fresh food.
"Alarming, especially the huge popularity of sweet soft drinks," will be included in the final report on the survey.
At lunch, the main court, pasta just before poultry.
Pulses almost never liked the children and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as the lunch was very low.
Hinkehr to health
At the same time, the survey showed, however, that the children are willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"The survey participants in the control group, after the completion of the questionnaire aufklärenden lecture" obesity is no coincidence "ausfüllten, in many cases, was a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy diet has" is in the results of the project.
This was evident in the sweet Limos, for example, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
Approaching the children in the questionnaire also much more poultry or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less Knödel or sweet foods to eat.
Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a bit gemeckert that is a bit too much fuel for the start.
Little did I not in the slightest, even more.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the "on the job".
There is worse to come.
The closer examination, the more information and practical tasks we have before.
But even if the rate each on Saturdays and Sundays, it is fully documented.
This time we debated with director "Ethyl '(the rate is not one man's), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And this is, after all, most of us.
Some have a short neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of Stylisten, broad shoulders look to conceal the neck or the need to extend hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got clues, as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great bosom, broad hip and narrower pretty slim waists and attracts figure emphasises, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between slim waists and Hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers really not fit, you should at least a little under schneidern.
This will certainly not regret it because, well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel is much better than in an off-the-shelf, and constantly verrutscht of slim waists absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, allow clothing with wrinkles, construction, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week, I thoroughly over.
And yet, I fear that in the face of assigned homework almost impossible to achieve.
Each of the course participants received a Promi allocated for which they should devise suitable attire - days clothing and Abendrobe.
This is the current design, fashion and style of the respective stars whose Figurtyp account.
I should attract Miranda Kerr "," you may be the campaign Victoria's Secret.
I juble internally, because this is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera to attract the last time has grown to hundreds of kilograms (okay, this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then grafisch first.
In "Moodboard", as the outcome is known, is our personal style and our relationship with the Count's design.
It is very important, even on the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist, the model is not only physically, but also in the so-called product side in the journal (for specific target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it was only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist have a good overall picture.
With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday lecture was equal three visitors from the industry seasoned:
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, from Jakub Polanka fashion designers and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
Stylist and eingeschickter can with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way to work.
The magic word is variability.
You can, for example, a business as usual on the Trenchcoat wearing jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, shoes and attract him to wear a dress.
It is enough, the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and equal, the whole look very different.
 "Is it," he said.
But most of all, I want the following advice: "First you perfectly know the rules."
"Only then can they violate it," said Jakub.
Finally, clear to me why we need all these theories loud fanfare, which you can combine with what and why, even if in Modejournalen often quite different to see.
Not to mention of fashion look.
Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now that a Stylist much more clothing options must be prepared when he photographed at the end.
So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared at least 15 to stylen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite different than in reality.
All of this must be in shaping the attire.
That image and Styl sometimes half of success, which also Jan Pokorný confirmed.
You only need to Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer, from the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a Stylisten rather wary.
Well-known personalities do often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I look at is secondary).
And if one of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is likely to have a very different (smaller) size on when he or she really needs.
Then we need only to subsequently googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding Promi again or have declined, etc.
Jan and Mario presented to us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the clothes "assemble" needs.
In his work he needs above all to communicate with the people he stylt and it must be a clever psychologist.
People, without anzubiedern and his opinion.
"If we have any manager in order to their clothes cabinet to look and beautiful pieces, then it does not eliminate the entire cabinet and say, my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few good things to which it recommends what they can contribute," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what such a so-called "seat pocket".
So a pocket in the slim waists zuknöpft and all necessary Proprietäten in itself.
No such clear things like scissors, Abroller remove the hair or safety needles, it contains, such as a Nylonfaden (so that helps the Stylist the photography products, such as handbags and hats), specific clips, which is behind the clothes gerafft, if it is too large (Stecknadeln or other klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken Nähzeug) and of course.
But we must not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to put right in shoes.
The photography studio, where the floor is, you can damage the Schuhsohle, let alone the outside.
Us o klebten and klebten we...
With the gap, we should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So we really must be sent.
Mario enjoyed me by my "creation" praised without restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is not just my strength.
All this was just a fraction of what we in the second weekend-continuation rate to hear.
One thing is clear to me now - the Styling to devote at professional level is not an easy task.
V need for speed, "the run '- the illegal race across America
Review
Originally, careless driving through a series of entirely preventable, dilettantischer error routine journey for the early shift.
It was, for the most part the ambitions, but what use is that, if there is clearly no one wish to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, inspired the new part with the title "The run 'high expectations.
He promised but already bejahrte games series' need for speed "a step in a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration in play, he seemed genuinely not only one of many Action-Rennspielen.
We were also curious to know how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But as it is already used in NFS is ultimately a lot different than it had expected.
Sure, there are potentially very decent Arkade-race, but overall the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series is more or less for a couple of years.
So it is not really a mistake more and more signs of basically incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First will be introduced in history, whose main character Jack certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you get wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is in ten stages and distributed more than 50 individual race.
This means that every race on other route will be fought and that the various stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
There is no moment the impression that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nicely, although the technical level of graphics than that of the previous sections of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering news.
But the journey through the desert, herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
Atypical elements and bring a little change in the individual race.
For example, in the desert will be surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts view.
In the mountains, in turn, should you need to watch your step that cannot be killed by an avalanche.
By the way, are quite good running built in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while it tries, the required number of opponents to overtake (in principle a classic race), you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then a still expects a personal duel with a single opponent.
And this is also the police who wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animation is a huge hit in which Jack before anyone fleeing and where the players must help him, at the right moment, the right button.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (specifically, only three).
Ultimately, this is the matter more benefit, because at least this element has no chance of being boring - it is in the context of the high point to the elements that make the game diversify.
The Fahrmodell Fußtapfen continues in the previous sections.
This means that from today's point of view, there is no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be bad.
Anyone who looks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But an action invited the European Fahrmodell Rennfahren will continue to play very well, although we could find better in the competition.
Until then, as far as everything.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
Unlike the Fahrmodell collision model is not quite OK
In a game of this type is hard to expect that complex disorders and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object clue as to how the car, then it is obviously not everything in order.
Case in point: The close-up or just to oncoming cars "scratches" in some places the other car only slightly, in another, almost identical situation but it turns into a tailspin and wild Pirouetten.
Or the Karre equal to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart-system which is nothing more, as it is always annoying.
The rest Arts are resolved, if total damage or remote ends up the line, then cast a the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race has only five rest Arts.
If it has exhausted, everything is happening again.
The rest Arts is more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it should be abandoned.
Sometimes, but not even the Restart helps, as does nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
Very embarrassing is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, to pass through very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, we met at the relevant point "civilian" cars are in the same configuration, whether it be the first and fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away, but before it even gets to the car in such a position that they must avoid or slow down.
And it does not matter when you get there, everything is designed to this situation is close to your nose.
The opponents have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you always at the same point being overtaken by the same opponents and again, regardless of the time.
This is the most insane at the end of the game on the long bridge in the direction.
The Kontrahent must here seem hell bent on overhaul.
And if he gets one, then of course it makes a point of view, so they started their own car a couple of times in Klump.
Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and exciting events but this intention is so clear that they quickly vermiest the joy of game.
And that is a pity, because despite the game as a whole sold Fahrmodell is quite entertaining and in places such action also charged that almost no longer knows where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what it is to blame, the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can prevent boredom, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car exchange during the race.
The stations we must not overlook the route, because here we can change the car, although in most cases the car enough that you just did.
The cars are split into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical operations, for example, at the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the way the game history is also the tasks-mode (challenges) - the race in the various premises, which we know from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for their own profile, which together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to achieve a higher level of drivers, must be open to different objects: The car started to Backgrounds for the profile.
This is the online operation Autolog, among other things, the results achieved compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here it is: The car in a subway tunnel (as), where one in the dark on the track long-rast (as).
Look at the Tacho points between 150 a 200 km/h (as), but there is suddenly from behind a subway and drive to scrap an uncompromising.
In our editorial we may still argue about whether a blackout of the game makers was or whether the authors is so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases very appealing and even brilliant here and there.
All the more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatically.
It is, however, specifically the accidents with greater number of concerned, where a continuous FPS is useless.
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste.
In a bid to as wide as possible scale more young audience, was a Sound Track a lá "of any more" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of need for speed: The run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game is not by the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors would have held the belief we can claim that The run the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game is somehow unfinished.
In for a klasse pleasure, but you should be prepared that one of these mistakes with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern sting in the eye.

EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon, the balance between the different institutions felt from the Lot."
I would not have expected such a hard war flares. "
"There will be five or six years, until the dust settled, and all of their new role will be used," girl Milena Vicenová began, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply its presentation at the law faculty.
How seriously they the motto "understandable and openly about Europe", they showed in the first part of her speech, in which it was the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations on such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of Charles University's law faculty can therefore would envy.
Madam Vicenová also praised the new permanent president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism that he was too quietly - a grey official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say that it has brought all of how well he has adopted the cause.
"He is a man who has 27 Member States patiently listen, communicate with and, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said it as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call? ", as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our Ölmützer Quargel
Madam Vicenová dedicating the agenda, according to which the European Union, and to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a great Negativum that the image of the Czech Republic was severely damaged.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador, said that it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis is not yet over, pretty hectic.
And there is still the seven-year EU budget be approved, which is precisely because of the current economic situation is much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget will be the priority sectors which countries more or less be encouraged - all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "Understandable on Europe."
"If I may not, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can I actually know as citizens, whether in Brussels or round really curly cucumbers and different large banana invented just or whether we actually someone wants to ban the Quargel.
They would also like to the bottom of the EU used to more Czechs in European institutions.
Two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs in the reputation of Eurosceptics, the more negative than positive aspects of the matter.
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian come to me and Slovaks in the vicinity, it believes the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is it because the heads together - is the back your V4? 'And it makes a pretty acid Face.
According to Mrs Vicenové expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of bestärkten cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate, who want it and who do not want to be left out."
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately to a strong" multi-speed Europe ', "Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues with impact on the whole of the EU will be discussed by all member states, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
Fire story:
The innovator IBM is into the second century of its existence
If you are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most accurate, it would be the word 'longevity. "
For the general public is IBM a synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although since its inception a century has passed.
The basis for this longevity has presented its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson first
He was already the slogan, countless global problems could be solved easily if people were prepared to consider a bit.
His slogan: "Think!" Was the trademark to the life of the future giants (and, at the same time, the title of the corporate internal magazine with IBM already publish began in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not shied away from using everything surrounding it.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technologies, the Business and also to transform society.
We hope that the next hundred years to create even more, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
Watson has been carried out in the 1930s social care of its employees, in a similar way, such as entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had to be one of the first American workers paid leave, an insurance through employers plus elegant uniforms and work clothes and a reasonable remuneration system for best innovators and traders.
As more sophisticated, the long-term relationships with customers by IBM.
The company was brilliant in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the head of IBM Palmisan next year by a woman, of Virginia Rometty abgewechselt.
It has been 30 years at IBM, before they took the position of Vetriebs, marketing and strategy.
IBM power in recent years, so-called online brainstorming session, from which many future strategies and innovations.
Not surprisingly, there is no shortage of ideas, the company is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakeable position in the business for the company and a strong image at home and abroad.
"From the beginning, IBM was the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist the professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a firm, the business through technology helps solve problems," added George Colony of Consulting-firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, there is a difference in the market to be present only by the presence or him directly.
IBM - in the states of their logos for family "Big Blue", in a century, is one of the largest companies in the world has come of age.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies have developed - IBM hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product broad - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.
With approximately $220 billion in stock market value (market capitalization) was IBM this year, the second-largest technology companies (after Apple), and for the first time since 1996 Microsoft obsolete.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - for example, the attempt was unhappy with its own operating system, os/2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not emotionell tied to the past," says to Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem, its basic walls on various platforms to build - and if they do not work, they also leaving.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, in principle, with its Windows operating system stands or falls.
Promising technologies
Part of the profits from IBM to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in each one-fifth.
It was 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profits for big assets worth $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in the shopping future technologies.
In these investment drive IBM after 2008, when the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept across the world.
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, in the middle of a major global economic crisis his investment volume increased.
So far, it appears that the company IBM emerges unscathed from the current crisis.
The value of the IBM shares rose raketenartig since 2008 by 120 percent and net profit of the company is growing kontinuell.
The company slogan of IBM is: Everything can change not only the values.
It is also expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis.
IBM history: The cheese Schneider to outer space flights
The one hundred years ago in New York-based company IBM (International Business Machines) was initially a very complicated name - Computing Tabulating recording Corporation.
The name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later society IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history until the 1980s, dating back to the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on registration of work and endes begins.
The architects of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930 also holds the presidency of the supervisory board.
And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson hit for him in the management of the company.
This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas until today the unbesiegbare culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name suggests, with the production and distribution of all sorts of machinery for trade - of sausage-and Käseschneidern to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company, finance and on all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he whole forty years head sat in the chair, he was only by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
IBM began under his leadership in the development of artificial intelligence work and developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped engineers and computer from IBM NASA flights into space over the Merkur and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System/360.
A classic PC, the computer-standard that time certain, came in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150 onto the market.
Twenty years later veräußerte IBM his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, however, they bought the consul aunts part of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose to fully in the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value.
The strategy, IBM in the last three years, pays is the concept of "smarter planet".
It is the intention of technologies to clever way has not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in the transport and in the cities of administration.
IBM recently in the trade sector led the platform "smarter Commerce", which is intended to help the dealers, the whole of the business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia at all - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR, among other things, a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe take up residence in Prague and there is also a top research team of world-class that with the technology of Stimmerkennung.

The worst female vices: What is it with you?
If the men calls for some typical female vices, then they all shake some promptly from the sleeves.
Dear women, you will see in the following pages, in which a few Unsitten review, the men of the blood Wallen (?
Shopping addiction
Raises them her husband, shopping addiction?
You have to buy at least one conflict on a weekly basis?
Do you like to go shopping in actions and there must also be a bit more?
It is in your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of their shopping mood and try to keep more or less under control.
But hand on heart, what is there already, in search of a good seated upper clothing only through a clothes shop on bummeln and does not include all (in all sorts of Farbkombinationen) in the booth to try?
Even if the shopping for most women is a hobby for the men, it is often the pure hell.
They consider just how often they have said her husband, you may prefer to stick out...
Permanent discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have at least five kilos decline - should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I heard you at all?"
They know that somehow?
Yes?
Then you probably also belong to the women, the obsession of them are, how they look.
That is by no means that you should go, but many men allergic to respond if their wife constantly upset about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed, with increasing frequency of complaints, women are always unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in first
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows, and dust Fliesen sweep, the Wanne scheuern - and it at least twice a week.
You rail with their partner because he once again with dirty shoes on the clean Fliesen trampelt to chastise the children, because it just gescheuerte Waschbecken dreckig again, and because the glass door of a living room cabinet fingerprints has once again when the the whitening so much trouble?

"Dirty Turnhosen come in the laundry basket."
"Do you want the old socks really attract again tomorrow?"
"A watery towel not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings to the Palme.

If the men they knew then took the women may not be so much to meckern.

Some women came to clap and Chen, as is behind the backs getuschelt or even slandered or we forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they panting like such issues, such as, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
Would any of us women has a bit of harmless gossip at camp.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
But that is not to be confused with gossip aunts most serious calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, the most everyone around them, scorn and especially for women collective, represent a significant danger.

Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized GOVERNMENT travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agents were mainly sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were at the time, only a select few.
And so Czech tourists travelling to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use.
A lichte exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then beat Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist era, it was that there are not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed under the socialist countries to travel freely.
If a citizen of ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union, then he wanted to go to a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.
Even then, the travel agents also travel to the West, but then we had to accept huge queues or sleeping bag before the travel agency sent, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter is far from over.
The so-called currency commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" gives people - the others are not allowed to travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not a free exchange at face currency without foreign commitment so it would have been impossible to make the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West to find.
Which is why most Czechs weither spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit that lasted until today.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 revolution was followed by a trip to the foot of the Czechs.
Until 1989, during a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.
An enormous paradox, whose today no longer aware, is the fact that one of the most popular holiday country the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century, the foreign exchange requirements in the neighboring West European countries, which is a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken were long time from their trips to the West simply cannot get enough, everyone wanted to at least a couple of days there.
So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would then have the money for a shelter in the hotel or a pension.
A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a canning, beer and duration sausages etc vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna, after decades of our tourists were finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and that the average salaries rose to 1997 in another important moment einmündete.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began the travel agents after 1997 prepare regular visits by charter flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already exchange unemployment payments with all the advanced countries in the world, which made it even easier travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-velvet" travel was in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country-cleared after Thailand.
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel in exotic countries every year.
Another important moment in the era of our "post-revolutionary" development marked, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirement for Czech tourists on which our country is definitely in the advanced countries in the world einreihte.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday destination more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.
The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again threatens a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know.
To date, there is still no agreement on the electoral law to be elected.
And this is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek of his role, and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to some and a strong personality, which could lead to the football in the future.
Only - in the post Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers again Association, which is not able to agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, as the new chairman should be selected.
The delegates to the General Assembly were free of the People's House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiations led to any outcome and it was not only about the election itself.
Indeed, you could not even agree on who is entitled to the full collection is only the statutory representative or with a power-funded officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion, a representation at full power base is not admissible.
Disputes over the electoral law, however, continue to take.
The Executive Committee did not more clarity on the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views in relation to the election changed a couple of times - the nerve centre remained the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The issue is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR firmly in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who expressed as the greater support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is reportedly ready to compromise that one candidate triumphs, the higher number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner in this prozentuellen vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"Then the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best to the election in order not to argue, but under current statutes.
This is also surprisingly Tomáš Paclík, even if it emerges that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta.
"My wish is that as far as possible the statute is elected."
"So as not to be invented nonsensical ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is standing for the first time in his comments and above all to abgrenzte Pelta.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his view, is the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidate will work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football only on the euphoric wave sunset, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten and this brings the most experience at both professional and regional level.
There is more circumspect Rajchl.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes," zurechtzubiegen. ""
"That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded."
"However, I hope that common sense prevails at the end," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties, not more.
Some allegedly direct negotiations should take place in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität until qualification is complete.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice should fly in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder and not as it sought urgently for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee but still at the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
In the end, then surely the meeting at ministerial level, which it said on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties within the country's largest sports associations to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: Benefits Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting ČSTV of the Czech Sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction.
Paclík goes in the battle for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would make a strong candidate, for all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) have been met, he would have no cost to the fight for the leadership agreed.
"If there were a good candidate, then I would fight for him and for the election."
"But in the current situation, we did not find such a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík into duel with Mr Jindřich Rajchl Pelta and, it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, at the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the role of chairman is only a year until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to hear a top managers, not too much in the football is done.
"With a number of eligible people I have spoken personally."
"Hard to believe that some have said that they intend to do not currently identify with the Czech football.
 "Such views would like to have changed," he said.
Most of all, disturbs Paclík Pelta's alleged links with the chairman of the Football Association novel Pilsner district Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of chairman.
"In his victory would today's state einkonserviert and the Czech football if it was not at all."
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem businessman, would get the football twice as bad," said Paclík.
It is also important that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with telephone to identify in a corruption affair, however, emerged from the Pelta with impunity.
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory of the (tsch Pelta.) football should bring."
"And as we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA position," said řekl Paclík, his former phrase, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman shall," but rather more calmly.
Should Paclík in Thursday's election win, but he could be a future cooperation with Pelta well imagine.
As is also another candidate - Rajchl, Paclík before the general Assembly in October had supported, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I would have him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is capable of, the association as a manager."
"It is not my nose in matters that I do not understand," said Paclík, raised eyebrows in September it had ensured that he was behind the recall the referee Commission Luďěk Macela at the top was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And holding up his skills in the direction of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with its support in May, the first triumph in the league was celebrated.
"I have the power to something in the football environment and to a degree of cultivation of this."
"The impact of certain interest groups which tend to disciplinary and appeal commissions to influence what until sickening situation deteriorates," Paclík led to no secret of his antipathy towards the Sparta, for example, Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, he saw the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, through which he among political leaders to evoke that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as the political parties to declare, then I understand their reasoning, then they must also make it quite clear where the money is," he said.
His link to the Pilsner Paclík club is also not a handicap, although he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR should "bipartisan".
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"It is my opinion but not much point in my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to transfer to a third person, in order to return again after a year and a half," said Paclík clear.
New statutes of FAČR Pelta promised a stalemate ausschlössen in future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the event of his election campaign that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law rule out.
The official from Jablonec is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in any success of the Czech selection safely defused.
Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he would, if elected to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided only at the last moment in the election before the last general meeting and didn't want him to take part in the two-month pause to help his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoted to the football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who, says the man who, especially with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and acted in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience, the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today's problems with the election euphoria is responsible, the days of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the General Assembly approved in June statutes, which were not as perfect as we all thought.
If they are not allowed to have different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman from September, "Pelta said.
The revision of the main document of the citizens association he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I were president, I take it personally and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental issue, without which it cannot be" Pelta said.
In addition, he does not try to define his opponent.
He had earlier announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also Tomáš Paclík, no longer, which in turn to Pelta no dry thread.
In football, he has moved more than a year and is already on some successes. "
"His attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"So now doubt many of his true character," Pelta addressed his opponent, probably remain faithful to its repeating proclamations that he already in September.
In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also like to put an end to all Affairen Bohemians - of fog, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would shortly after on negotiations with the private and public sector, with sufficient funding to ensure the whole football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football would mean no human cleansing.
"I would like to start with the job content of all employees to familiarise themselves," he said towards the Strahov where, because of the long anarchy has understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk not in vain.
"If the only point of contention is how, in the third round, then we come over."
"Football needs credibility and win it only when he finally has a new leader," Pelta, two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins
If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim vermiesen.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual football fields.
In addition, he promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA, more money in football and otherwise, to continue the work of previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate the football as a whole."
From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, the professional football, down to the performance of the youth football. "
"This is not to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member of a certain area."
And I will be hard work, so that the football in each segment with miles steps forward. "
There were many not just delighted because they, rather than just the work of other now itself should start to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered, no longer standing.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, which I am not constantly spanner and every step I do, in question," he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do."
"This is confidence that it must not waste," he said.
Also allegedly motivated him to be able to continue the work he has started in Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great deal of work and I will now not simply throw."
"There were launched processes that have to wait for a few years to come and I would hate to see that they stopp someone," he said, and now his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, especially people who would make the football so that it is only for politicians."
I can be blamed for some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to do is to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it all goes well and not only the selected," said Rajchl.
It also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I was really the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league into a Czech and Moravian part should be divided, whose winners will each in the first league felt."
"It might not happen today that only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," says Rajchl.
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the struggle for the role of chairman, has joined Rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he is elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen to its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor for unfortunate contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the association, not a single thing.
While he Pelta says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence to help," he holds the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"No one can question it in Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly not the things in its favour hinbiegen want, "Rajchl judgement on his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travel through Europe, may be black magic - and after a city tour or a migratory the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest.
A book shows, where promotion in the water on the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder over the past year and a half on a research trip was not in her luggage had one thing missing: Her bathing suit.
Rücklings on water, they looked into high art full-designed domes, they swam marble-Putten on basin margins on they waited, and was on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
She did a bad, they did so in their note book values - and to know details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools architectural historian Meder answer in this way - and it is now in its just book "bathing joys": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
They led by 13 countries' trip to the most remarkable bathrooms in Central Europe ": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture-Enthusiastin.
With sports have not much in the news, says Meder - only in the water is the different.
Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell must resign, while the smell of Fichtenwäldern Jogger betörenden inhale or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.
"One day I was asked why swimming pools are always have to be ugly," says Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to warm baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
The leap basin Geplätscher sauna and essential oils - the promotion factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the terms to be served, Meder.
And if the builders of trouble, can be a real Augenschmaus Schwimmhallen: "Instead of a foot soil in bathrooms, a water surface."
"It is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."
Doubles every look: High vaults, colorful Kacheln, leap boards.
The kleinformatige picture band "bathing joys" gives to 190 sides know value on the architectural and cultural history of historic promotion-havens - but especially appetite for a leap in the dark.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder in their research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent Heilbädern as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-bath in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with water in bottles shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many offer spectacular prospects beheizte Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: While the entire city of Zurich Dachbad has in mind, one can in external pool of Bads in St Anton am Arlberg look at the snow covered - and that there is a window in Dampfbad, from which it continues to monitor the ski yard slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expected bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
For three after the top open parings dampft there in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool, the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
After many Thermalbäder smelt sulphur, Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much for fuel oil, which hardly believes that landed in a bad health.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal water that almost black and whose silt a stain on the skin, once we are sliding into the basin, a promotion-experience of the special nature.
In one place, Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing, however, also disappointed, as they have the freedom and the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz Sonnenbad wanted to visit, it was a abgesperrtes terrain.
The 1902-designed by the architects Dušan Jurkovic bath has since been closed.
As Meder verwitterten look through the windows of the red-white-and-yellow youth style-building raised, saw it as weeds between Fliesen wucherte.
On the other hand, the decline was countered in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Palais in Wildbad thermal bath.
Three construction schedules, this bad already behind it; you can discover not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added in 1900.
Since the thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palais's favourite thermal bath of pool knowledge Iris Meder - and not just because they originally came from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement, so different Baustile at such a great unity to merge," says Meder.
In such a palace in Thermalpool Tauchgang is apparently only a sideshow.
Agricultural-speculation
German bank, commodity-related business check
By Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank is their business with agricultural commodities?
After mirror-online information, Josef Ackermann, a working group, the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group's chief then consequences.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents want even that Deutsche Bank and other lenders for this business, because the problems of the world's poorest people.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Food Watch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, the betting on the global commodity exchanges pushing up prices - and therefore the banks involved in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley similar.
Commodity bet were originally intended for traders to hedge against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts agree that the gamblers from supply and demand have - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism that he promised to look into the allegations and said that no deal was "worth the reputation of Deutsche Bank to jeopardise."
According to information obtained by Spiegel Online examines an International Working Group is currently the accusations from the Food Watch Report.
By the end of the year is expected to be completed the test, then the results presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation, how it should be handled.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will announce their consequences.
In the end, a reduction of the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann forge his image
Foodwatch-leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food, particularly sharply, as reckless banks today the common good."
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, where money for betting on food prices will be used," said Bode.
"Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people, or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann, at first glance, it is clear, however, that the group's leader, a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Board chief differently than planned in the supervisory board will change.
With a retreat from the contentious agricultural-speculation he could improve his image.
And potential losses, it hardly needs to end his successor - that would have to be done.
Every second would terminate commodity-related facilities
Foodwatch is trying to put pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday Bode published the poll by the Forsa institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 people questioned.
Just 11 percent therefore believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank offers facilities where wagered on prices for food.
Many bank customers would also personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Half of the poll would terminate all facilities where money into the commodity-speculation.
43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to reflect on their account to drop out and to switch to another institution.
21er house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: The Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels, prices in 1958, was at the museum in Vienna, was empty and verkam.
Now he opened an exhibition House.
If modern postwar architecture geschwärmt is clear forms, glass halls, courageous Schwüngen and new building materials that are typical of the faith to technical progress is the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a good and well-known example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy float along steel-and-glass-design.
The construction is up today as a landmark contemporary architecture.
He made it known that the architects of the next World Expo pavilion built in Austria.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich in 1973, he was internationally famous.
His as a temporary exhibition planned pavilion was built after the World exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, in 1962 and converted to open a museum of the 20th century, "the 1920s house" it was called.
But the building was not suitable space and technically as museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long, and the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.
The Belvedere museum opened Tuesday night at the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck.
The fresh start has prevailed Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, permitted by art historian with considerable career including youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and put to use.
No contemporary art, the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba issued by the eponymous Foundation, a café and a book shop, and it should be an office had to be built to house.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation was the ideal Krischanitz occupation.
Not only because it in Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrichs sensitively converted and expanded and won the competition, but because he Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna has studied and the pavilion for him an "incredibly important place" was that he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which has been in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
The current restructuring, there were far greater problems: The building was "a Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Bridges cold-steel makers are increasingly or replaced, refurbished and asbestos blankets were filled.
Two sub-shells room for the new use, a abgesenkter light gap between House and street provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer-pavilion.
The original external doors have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen rust-protection-Farbton removed.
And the cinema is even more exactly as it once was.
And all of this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small budget.
"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in Untergeschoss.
Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the building is flexible and easily.
It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "from Brussels than usual," Krischanitz has recently said that a typical "early-in-the-City history."
Such a structure would "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fortune happened: The Swiss around the garden is completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may still happen: The 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin Temporäre art hall bought, and we hear, they have negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter-crisis package in millions
The railway has mapped out a contingency plan, which is to prevent Zugausfälle in winter.
The staff number to be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related Zugausfälle and delays, Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report this year, more than 70 million euros in addition.
"The picture" Zeitung previously reported, citing a company internal crisis plan until 2015 are investing a total of around 300 million euros.
It should be a better availability of vehicles and rail network in extreme Witterungen.
Is planned, among other things, a doubling of the internal and external staff for snow removal at railway stations and rail rise to 16,000 people.
Goal is to start until the company Inter and 90 per cent of operating necessary course within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, rail chief Rudiger hole after a top-level meeting with government and industry from cancellations and delays also warned this winter.
Last winter, the rail passenger transport significant problems, as it, inter alia, in difficult weather conditions on reserves.
So many new regional trains wait for years for an authorisation from the Railway Administration.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE-trains.
The railway also makes for years that they axes of ICE-trains significantly more frequently in the workshop to look after an ICE axes in Cologne Central Station had a breakthrough.
German bank pays millions of punishment in the US
After the uproar about chief Josef Ackermann, new hardships for the US: Deutsche Bank must pay a million fine.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giant is now his past in the US: The Frankfurt institution pays in a comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to disputes over the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA raises a number of big banks, credit unions with false promises of financial products led to buy; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost heavily in value during the financial crisis and tore the banks with in depth.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties had to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank acknowledged no fault with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, the payment of $20.5 million committed.
The NCUA-Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concession of two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is for the US cooperative banks and is responsible for failures in order to protect the client no documentation.
The NCUA tried to replace the billionaire damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had iron and other big banks in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued.
In the mortgage securities is so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it was a great number of financial firms doomed.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, swung the US investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events of a few years ago, the banks are currently in the United States, a sharp wind.
Investors and regulators have brought numerous claims for compensation or to punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the biggest complaint wave.
It raises 18 international big banks, the two state-owned US Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions to the tune of around $200 billion to have taken advantage.
The Deutsche Bank, a complaint the FHFA, there are several deals worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The regulator demanded that the Frankfurt for "substantial losses" music, without a precise figure.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as groundless and said, trying to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IT companies IBM.
Since March, he shares with a value of more than $10 billion bought.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett always said, not in IT and computer companies to invest, as the long-term development of firms predict poorly.
Now, however, he had read reports of IBM's business and its opinion on investment in the industry.
He had much earlier must understand that IBM implied above all services and computer systems for IT departments beschaffe other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is a knight blow in the financial world.
Consequently, the IT primitive IBM now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed in the US business channel CNBC that he since March IBM shares with a value of $10.7 billion bought.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest shareholders of IBM graduated with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett said that not even IBM has something of the commitment is known.
He praised the management, even in the economic crisis had provided for decent profits.
"They have done an excellent job," said Buffett's strategy.
IBM, for a long time on the lucrative IT Services as the operation of data centres.
Of the more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting firms in and powerful computers.
Buffett had hitherto shunned technology firms.
He says that he only invest in companies whose business also understand it.
Instead, Buffett around with a freight rail in a lubricant producers or machinery farmers.
In addition to its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly 80 subsidiaries also own shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-olds in the 1960s the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and with wise investment into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle modest.
It is for many investors around the world a cult figure.
His almost unmistakable sense for money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett's investments, the IBM share vorbörslich rose by one per cent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is known, is in the stock market as a whole, worth more than $20 billion and is therefore along with Apple and Microsoft is one of the most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he would not.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of "Zwickauer cell" doubt Turkish media on German state of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which now auflebe again.
The killings of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background.
On this news will be in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German-Turks go back a long totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks.
In Germany, xenophobia, but was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network is revealed, however, proportions, whose dimension is still far from clear.
"Live on the bloody ideology?" Was the headline in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper, "Haber Turk."
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, said that one of the perpetrators of a V-man of constitutional protection should have been, and is concerned that German authorities in the extreme right-wing swamp might be involved.
Germany's Turkish community responded calmly: They reminded over the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In happy colours was the co-existence has been staged as a history of success.
As a slap in the face, as the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform, "Haber X," of the background of the series of murders speaking.
The German edition of 'Hürriyet' does not take these ideas together.
"It is beginning to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been killed, the taxes paid and their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done.
Is extremely critical in German-Turkish internet forums, the actions of the police investigation and their later success.
Why the German authorities do not have much more was learned, in extreme right-wing circles after suspects to surprise the authors.
Some shows to drastic measures prepared at least rhetorically: "Will continue to be a sloppy approach here, the migrants do nothing other than self-defence and the armed forces."
"This is probably the best self-protection."
"The quality of education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, shows up the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance in right-wing violence can lead.
But the attacks schärften the We-feeling on the Turkish side.
Not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was, above all, the failure of the German policy after the attacks highlighted the fact: Helmut Kohl, who refused to visit survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, was at the funeral in Cologne, but of his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was back in his speech on how many charges the local Turks.
As the value of a human berechne after the level of its tax deductions.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep distrust of many German Turks in the domestic law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs this time open words.
The scandal Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste Bank Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was nearly bankrupt during the financial crisis, and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.
Now it is a German.
It was certainly not intended Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was bekanntgeworden in July 2013 an almost as spectacular new job, board president of the Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected large and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly praised Switzerland's UBS whether their beauty and whether their newly acquired solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be very different.
A trader of UBS in London had all security systems of the bank and around EUR 1.7 billion verzockt.
UBS-CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go.
The Board President of UBS, also wounded since then - and all ask: When will finally Axel Weber?
It was already known that Weber, the bank advised by February 2012.
And the board before he takes office in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, the tough.
He is not a banker, economics professor and central bankers and would have had time to get to grips certainly needed.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again demonstrated that they have the title of "biggest scandal Bank of Europe".
Because the UBS is huge, until recently, it was the biggest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, for years has been reeling from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is the once-proud Swiss bank saves.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters had combined with ambitious objectives: She wanted in investment banking, a very large number.
It manages the UBS $1.6 trillion in 2007, on the one hand, high-net-worth clients more money than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, was an investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world have advanced.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: 'My students, I have the UBS was always regarded as a model of good bank. "
"From today, one wonders: How could I just so wrong?"
He was huge.
In 2007, for the first time appears to be that if something went wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising back, until such time as high intellectual and equally ingenious bankers.
A few months later, you guessed what, why he had gone.
The investment banking division had with sub-prime securities verzockt and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs.
It was indeed for investors, but what about the many until shortly before the nose gerümpft: A non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which it said was that it was not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there was worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, following the disaster, the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation, six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which the bank they Miteigentümerin.
The whole country was shocked - because they said how dramatically it for a small country if it is so big banks.
After all, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says banks researchers Geiger.
The first disaster, the second.
A few months later, surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients, perhaps with the help of the bank being evaded taxes.
They also agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this kid Strafaufschlag.
This well-known the UBS more or less open to assist in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: The aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Board President.
And the exodus of clients' money.
The bank within a few months of their credibility lost in two key business areas: In investment banking by the false speculation and asset management assistance to tax evasion.
And just a little calmer than it was just when you thought the UBS will now get it again, as follows this unfortunate dealer-story: An individual traders verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notes that something was wrong.
And it seems to be: With the risk management in the investment banking work there is obviously still not.
"With the case of Adoboli, we find that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial management of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that they are not in control of the risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers took a long time ago, guardian of the major assets of the world: Not too many risks for security for money even beyond the Alpine republic in the world.
The coffers of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and particularly noble Sprüngli chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of sterling Swiss private bank - it is just a bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich railway station, the main train station from the Zürichsee leads directly by the snow covered summits of the Swiss mountains frames.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition shops like Confiserie Sprüngli.
Stay here for centuries, the Swiss banks, the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear.
The reception hall of UBS, one enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are thick marble disguised, leather chair, in addition to the bank's logo is a great sign for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking here: Security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name, he would prefer not to read in the newspaper, after all, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS is far too big, he finds - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS modified, their only received high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution in the subprime jungle lost as much money as the Swiss large bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million, the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros allocated the politicians, from bankruptcy in order to save the big banks.
How could this happen?
Talk with Swiss bankers, so they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks to a huge corporation.
There was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and increasingly grew.
It helped that the two different precursor-banks UBS supplemented: A rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they have a huge wheel.
Two names are on the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, group chief executive of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banks researchers Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, higher intellectuals, modest, a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man, who is from the bank lesson to top up."
But Ospel was finally left to Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake, "he thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Excess came before the fall.
Staff at the UBS will remember clearly to the leaders' meetings in which company chief Wuffli was always the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
They led the league with "in the rankings, the success of the banks that time documented.
Then, wanted to UBS, according to the top.
A few steps, she has managed to do so.
In foreign exchange business and the stock was trading at the top with them.
Corporate advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: International interest in the business, in which bankers language "surprise fixed Income," there is a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in mortgage products.
To close the gap left UBS in an adventure that nearly cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the Bank itself invested and above their established hedge funds in American sub-prime assets.
It became a huge machine, the securities on US mortgage loans packaged and far-reaching, but also risks maintained.
Also, as other banks have sought out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep.
A manager had to go after the other and clean up the experiments tested more difficult than thought.
Items in the UBS became the weapon and are still shaky.
Anyone who now leads the major bank, has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which lost all obvious business models.
Banks researchers Geiger already has an idea: Stop the investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the Bank may not (yet).
But that investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually intended only as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprising Grübel separated by predecessor.
Meanwhile, he has won: He is in the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to roll back the in the mid-1990s.
He cut 3,500 jobs.
But it will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.
So far only publicly he says that he and his wife, once a home in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart Krähen broad in cities from
Many Saatkrähen apply as "problem birds', but from the cities are highly intelligent animals no longer drive, say experts.
They may be the one to the other, they want to get rid of very quickly: Krähen belong to the city for centuries, but in many local residents is mounting complaints about dirt and noise of the animals.
This is a remedy for the problem birds' not yet in sight.
Saatkrähen are no longer out from the cities, said experts at the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen empty.
There when experts from across the federal territory on possible ways.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists have led the problems in cities to the rural exodus of overprotected Saatkrähen: The chemicals used in agriculture vernichte increasingly traditional habitats.
Hunting, increased building and the cases of typical Brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds.
Krähen are under protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaaren there is, among other things, in the Westphalian Soest, in the north-west in Jever to Diepholz and Achim in Bremen and empty.
In 2005, there was a controversial project to mass killing of Krähen in the district of disincentives built into the headlines.
Critics had the trapping of animals and birds are clubbing with clubs, a particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the vergrämen, brings nothing", the city and landscape designers Werner Klöver from empty.
Pockets of water wegspritzen or trees, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are soft, large colonies of divide and spread to other areas."
Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we no longer get away."
Without the periphery will solve the problem not resolve in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from empty.
There was a combination of vergrämen of animals from sensitive Wohnbereichen and being lured to resettle them elsewhere.
"Info billboards instead of chainsaws" was the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different approach to the animals, "in the face of a Pickel, we can best self-confident."
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Berger Krähen co-Lehrpfad warning signs about the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen information.
The project will now adopted by tourists.
The criticism of the noise of the birds Jürgens had its own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, which have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen not only use tools to reach a biscuit, but as a tool of their tool even themselves.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge in four Saatkrähen recently tested how far the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that it down with stones to a structure, in order to reach a Mottenlarve.
Without much training realized they purposefully what size and shape a stone must have the platform to collapse.
In a second experiment, the smart Krähen kniffligeres solve a problem.
In a vertical Zylinder researchers had set up a small bucket with a Mottenlarve.
With the Schnabel the birds could not achieve their prey.
However, the researchers had them pieces of wire.
All four of the animals that shaped a catch, which they then the bucket Chen angelten on grip from the bag.

On a personal level of mass slaughter
Peter Englunds begins sensitive and generous new book "beauty and horror: A History of the First World War, told in nineteen Schicksalen" with a long list of key personnel, a heart.
Here a typing of proceeding: Are you this side carefully and make it to your read signs.
They are these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and the main people than your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments where you like Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book that he not incorrect as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, reckless reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he said, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, ideas, experiences and feelings."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experience of 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, losing limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives on as the Votivkerzen future has come in a church, some are added, while other lapse.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrected the notion that the First World War was just the disastrous position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" ends with experts view on other war theaters: The Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.
This is almost from the beginning, a very moving book.
The war swamped the lives of these people as a natural disaster such as a hurricane Katrina, after Kordit smell.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You stay or take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being fought.
"Lack of facts," Englund is, "with suspicion, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumours aufgemöbelt."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stamp, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other things have already taken (material.
Their lives can be shocking or simply reports, but they are very alive in details in Englunds loses accumulation of small moments.
Many of them act of shortages and affordable remedies.
In the history of a German Schulmädchens told him: "Replacement, everywhere."
"Spare coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
He told more of the spare lunch in Germany.
He describes "meat from large compressed piece of rice and in Hammelfett gebacken (and most recently served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden besohlt."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food spare funds in the manufacture of sausages were allowed, 511 registered coffee substitute means."
Some stories act of honour and bravery.
An American acknowledges his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "It feels that, despite everything, that is, rather than for men was scheduled to sit in Lehnstuhl, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to act as a means to such a veneer of civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and beschlagenen shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier to die and that he probably nobody notice or would be done.
"If one of the idea of self-sacrifice, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is so terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations act of the old Europe, the fall apart, and on new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he called "a new species in the young century Bestiarium": "The eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderers in the yardstick, the murdered while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there are equally frivoles behaviour as heroic acts.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who are actively trying to a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front-line services.
"The grotesque expression of trade can be found with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope, to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who really have been desperate rieben him in the eyes, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
This translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is elastic and yet unaufdringlich and fits in perfectly with his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he the way, as the war "on unique way uncontrollable forces Unbound: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to ask why they fought for their leaders.
The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band is an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a Sachbuch.
I am no longer.
But it is as if he is with his book this side of the main persons in the face with a coup and snapped up wood lit.
After an early mistake a meticulously planned assault

The events of the past few weeks as the onset of has been blinded against protesters, which is against the rules of Dezernats Hausbesetzern and a huge increase in public sympathy, were not repeated.
And it was the police action on the removal of protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them when they saw occupations in other cities were handled.
A Katastrophenübung had with a view to Zuccotti on peripheral space Iceland.
Officials increased the so-called chaos-training, measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid displacing a large number of police officers - in order to focus on lower Manhattan.
The final training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to collect in the park, "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the existence of a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police officers who were involved, I understand, did not know that it went to Zuccotti Park," said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it went to Zuccotti Park, the senior officials of the portfolios."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October officials wanted the parking spaces, differed, however, when hundreds of Protestlern came together after they learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation Tuesday, including use of commandos from around the city, hundreds of mobile officials who would normally be used in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the park and, almost as commuters, 1 p.m. on the night is a good time with.
"It was appropriate to do so if the least number of people in the park territory," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiterlampen and, according to spokesmen were faced with the departure of the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages from the loud speakers dröhnten seemed to many protesters.
When the public officials in their bright blue Windjacken broke into the park, many protesters rafften simply their things together and walked out of the place.
The police said that until 1:45 p.m. no tents would be touched the Protestlern time to give their possessions to get together.
Other teams of officers were seen in the vicinity collected to intervene if necessary arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the police spokesman, said that it was for their own safety.
But many journalists say that they wanted to stop, the police actions in the park to see, and they said that the treatment of the staff was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that television vehicles in the Church Street on the west side of the park had photos.
When the police in the West by the great confusion in personal terms of the protesters, including suitcase, art and Tüten lawn with clothes, turbulent, followed by their workers cleaning the city, which removed, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go, were towed out. Images of even a short time later appeared on the Internet.
One of the main core of Protestlern was near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some erected barriers and the police began their methodological arrests.
Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp did ancient to their poor.
And two people ketteten themselves to trees, said Mr Kelly.
The civil protection officials were called to loszuschneiden.
As Mr Kelly said that, until about 3:30 a.m. no arrests in the park.
The evacuation was, according to the police after 75 minutes to complete.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came to it, as he said, because "joined and resisting arrest."
The most prominent local officials was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officers of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department Kriminalbeamten, was also there.
Despite its presence ', "Mr Kelly" Operation not ", as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should have waited a second group of officials on the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, were erected barricades.
It could be seen as these sites from the police to the area around the Zuccotti Park as well.
It was observed in one place, as several officials, many of them with protection, people pushed out.
Some 28 people were in the northern radius.
Some of the most violent actions of the night, in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m. south of Pine Street jumped a protesters on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators, the air in the tyre of a police bus.
The amount raised in one place a piece of Sperrholz.
In the end, an official and a hospital protesters.
Trade union of carers because redundancies will file a complaint against the city
The union, the hundreds of Schulbetreuern last month have lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence on schools, poor students, not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance, the trade union, District Council 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer, care coordinators and other staff, are among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for that last year the city of access to a health care fund, which had the working groups, had denied the budget gap should be closed.
These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, last month, the redundancies are part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that Schulhilfe staff would be made redundant.
Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had the Ministry of Education and warned against a complaint. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint, Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant, eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of which are of color or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city was not the case and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.
According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighborhoods of the city, a complaint for discrimination. It claims that poor schools more workers would have lost, because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there was no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in schools or TriBeCa's Upper East Side, 17 Schulhelfer in the District 23 in Brown Ville, Brooklyn, and 46 workers have lost in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx.
With the discovery of the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern, 36 in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighbourhood worried parents who can organise donations to budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th Distrikts 3.26% this year has been cut, and have lost money, as the city of their calculation method for the extra funding for any poor school enrolment changed.
The union also complained that the heads of the high schools through the language in a memo to mislead, which authorized the release of care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: Transfer) in the United States, usually the exchange of a teacher on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central Unit.
"Sechsundsechzig care coordinators were sacked, not handed over," says the complaint.
Mission ended, Congress prepared to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday approved the Committee for international relations of the Senate, a resolution the Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), and Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "courage" praises.
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, with the reconstruction of their country have begun," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer arguing lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission to NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain, a resolution before the limited use of military force in Libya, the United States.
The law has been in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties rejected and there was no vote.
But on the same day fell by this bill in the Senate and the House voted on a decision to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was raised enough, Obama's approach in the context of the mission to criticise, but not angry enough to him finally pull the rug from under our feet.
Then the indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be willing to take action.
The resolution of the Committee for international relations "congratulates the people of Libya on her enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their exceptional courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measures will have the full support of the committee on foreign relations or they will divide the legislator, as the law in June?
The final version is on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican on the committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that it has the final version of the new law have not yet seen.
According to the Capitol, the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term, the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, under the leadership of the Republican Bob good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other sector, which at the time of the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to Congress and a whole range of issues.
Some are twice - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate - others are slightly different.
There are only in the Senate at least 15 versions of Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung and another dozen, "federal spending control".
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie among Republicans who want to burnish their CV - the possibility to bluster that such a measure "written".
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both Senate and Congress on a change to balancing the budget vote.
In March, 58 senators for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
On the budget, some members want the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York) the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes, including the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment that bans on same-sex marriage, as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring documents.
Some lawmakers also want the lifting of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states that reject.
So assiduously, as members suggest changes, so far as they move faster in recent years.
In 111. Congress, lawmakers 77 such changes in 110 vor.. Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which more than 150 members regularly changes every two years, so the figures, which the Senate library available.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment, which is to say, 27, was ratified in 1992, but was already proposed to Congress in 1789.
", but not defeated," Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election rally in Tucson had fired on them, the Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening on national television. They sang alone on Broadway-piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover, is bigger than the one in the Congress.
As they, along with Diane Sawyer on ABC News "20/20", they struggled for words and needed assistance walking.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, who shared her skull, the left side of her brain durchbohrt and its head has broadened from start to finish.
Three months ago, she returned surprising in the Congress to vote on the debt brake triumphantly.
In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 injured, smiling Gifford, lachte and sang, and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" Specials that just before the publication of a new book by the couple was recorded, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos Kelly was recorded in the first few weeks, you see them in the hospital bed, with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on the stand.
They can only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged them.
Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists her show how they simple movements.
A nodding to the head.
A Zucken with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispering another word: "Toast." They want their breakfast.
Videos, which happened in the NBC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery was: You see the congressmen, along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have fun," and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin '" sings.
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy a day to remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that Giffords on 12 March, an article in a newspaper about the attack had read out, as it cut off and, for the first time in the six people asked who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and will compulsorily medically treated, while he waits for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Tough, tough, tough."
In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly told Sawyer, she said: "I was taken."
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you got to be vanquished?'," said Kelly.
You just got to be taken.
And you will see that you and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street-gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans collected in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue out collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, of the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, the chief of staff and former Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, was saw the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organisers are well intentioned.
I know that.
But there was no respect, really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members.
The public is increasingly acting as would do their people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean MacFarland, as the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan Law or free soon after.
"But it seems the only way of support the person is in the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is very sensitive for military leaders, not ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve to appear.
They have also acknowledged that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War encountered was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and Guided between war veterans.
After his two sons from battles with the marines returned, warned the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian they cautioned that people outside the military world its service from two different perspectives could see.
Some would it with a sense of awe, since they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic locations.
Others will wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," says Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and on his return, a senior government posts in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly erfragten whether he was able to immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you only talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions about it," says Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest on the part of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield in a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely singled out as praise.
"We as a nation value military heroism not more so, as it was in the Second World War was absolutely normal," said a lieutenant general David Barno a.D., the US troops in Afghanistan Law or free.
Instead, focuses the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of service members.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks, which they have endured, the number of friends they lost or the severity of their injuries.
The military is growing pressure to crack in rape
This week is an important hearing about whether 28 men and women for failing to intervene in a rape accused before the military court.
It should not happen, there are hundreds of prosecutor for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant at night, when she was raped by a fellow soldier.
It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, the one 12er Pack beer in itself.
He asked them whether they accompany a drink in her room.
"My alarm went on," Lyman said.
But the Texanerin wischte aside their concerns.
I thought: 'Oh what he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had in my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped her, she said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a complaint made against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, have admitted in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months to 28 increases: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to establish a proper jurisdiction to condemn or after the alleged attacks available.
Burke says that they have followed the top military leadership, because the problem there will begin.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation by the leadership."
Burke also says that since February has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future actions.
Their strategy: Instead of all claimants were lay their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints, in order to maintain the pressure.
The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to reject complaint.
The files of the court, the Newsweek, in detail, the lead defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military is not current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for violations that took place in the armed forces.
As a result of the Supreme Court Act of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government will not be liable for violations that troops on active service.
"The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs," states the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, it is the distinction only in name: Modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in the contact link with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: Between these two wars 150 soldier died, two-thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.
And it is not alone in their struggle: Three other complaints unless they are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran 'Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies, because of alleged promotion of women hostile atmosphere.
This independent collects the not-for-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military, which is on the diagnosis "personality disorder", the rape victims received from the service in order to release a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people viewing the said that the service had been sexually abused.
Nine laws have been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, a number of leads.
2010, according to the Sexual assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuses.
But most abuses are not reported and after its own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure included approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases, per year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: 2010, 20 per cent of recorded cases in military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of trauma.
Lymans case reported in the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, she was 11 times, the details of the rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders to tell.
She had a rape set and the blood of their aggressor from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, was heard by a judge Lyman. During this hearing, she was asked after the sex, before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people have said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which ultimately was acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman said.
"I thought that would go into labor. I ran from the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me in the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out to my commander said: That was not his procedures. This was my procedures."
Lyman was invited to a military psychiatrist, in the end a personality disorder diagnosed and unable to service said.
In January 2010, she was dishonourable, so they have no support.
Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other claimants have put forward, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, it says: "I think they should move forward."
What between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which criticized for the first time since it was called into question.
I am now lives a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military, a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, the liability.
He adds: "The odds are against it... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not their way, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We in this respect, the military will continue to fight until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever the first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watching you on Facebook
Before the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys, whose anti-immigration views online programs.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed in a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Despite Breivik acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has a lot of time until his attack on his computer, with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, the right-wing extremist groups on the part of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy - you only have to connect on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett, the researchers simply Werbetool side must use their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - as retailers for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then with Adds visierte, but rather than with a new band or a new diet product verlinken, have invited the Adds users to a survey in which according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to consult once had to leave her office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "their online activism offline activism combined with a more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health and social trends such as "Likes" text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, on average, three content per day, data generated Facebooks supernova explosion "a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title in the last five years was almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that we can study this side of people, which are normally in the street with his Clipboard not achieved.
"If you previously tried to people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and never have access to them," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is all that away, you will go directly to them."
Others say that the party offers an opportunity to identify and social health problems to solve.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who were discussing their full binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they too many status updates postet.
"You can't solve a problem if you have not recognised," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would have been found."
Facebook also constantly zapft data of its own people.
The data team of side has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a National Happiness index created (and primarily data have been used to access Facebook - the only master of digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great data mine of others for research purposes should make available.)
But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched, whether they like it or not, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, one of the side's own personal data auszubringen.
But what if the users of Facebook part of a survey, they do not even know about?
While researchers strictly defined guidelines as to how they collect data offline, anything goes online.
"I do not believe that many users are reflecting on the fact that the researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006 in which he public pages of students on Facebook studied.
"What concerns them, it was just about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and contributions are true.
"What we say and what you on Facebook outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best research tools -- that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and to talk with real people," he says.
"Social research must be the social care - and plenty of social life is still offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Different Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Different Behring Breivik, the man who stood two Amokläufe where this summer were killed 77 people in Norway, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighters.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple Knight of Norway," he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, since you have received your mandate of organizations that support the hate ideologies and because it has the support of multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he "wanted to give the possibility not Breivik this hearing to use as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused a pre-written speech mitbrachte, the permit, at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody maintains that he four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and the entire correspondence about eight weeks will be closely monitoring.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind bars.
All took part with the goal that all amounts to a wegschließen.
"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, it is a bit further, having seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and helped throughout the hearing. He looked calm and professional journalists and survivors in the eye when he re-entered and left the building.
Despite Breiviks bizarrem hint that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
There may be some like that the attacks on 22 July appears to be the work of a single extremists and was not a group of radicals.
But relieved that automatically the grief and confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he would like a monster, but it does not," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors.

This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the film "68minütigen Steve Jobs: The Lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the country Mark-theatre.
For someone who is known for his detailed interviews abhors, jobs are surprisingly keen to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtfully.
During the interviews, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds at home, where jobs are clearly weighing his thoughts and accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfect on days when he apparently impatiently awaiting him anschubst Cringelys questions and respond more quickly to issues or alongside acts of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the people interview somehow seems incredibly far-sighted if Jobs assesses what other companies make him right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to posthumous awards to read 'career jobs, but jobs here as the begierigen dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had said all this, and he made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews:
As he got a business to run.
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask:" Why if you do things? "And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, it is easy."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one in the business really thinks about things in detail.
I have noticed.
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline accounting for Apple.
Puzzled as costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs" on mere suspicion towards were quantified and then with "departure" adapted, he developed an automated factory, which ensured that micro-business costs could be determined.
As the Pope veralbert:
Jobs told of the blue box "with Steve Wozniak built a device to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls for nothing.
On the device much has already been written, but Jobs enthusiasm when he crossed the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box, a gebührenpflichtiges phone use and then make a phone call from an AT & T's network to another, while so many satellites as possible by them.
"We gave the half a dozen times around the world and if you into the phone grölte, there was a minute later in the phone next door," told kichernd jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something yourself, the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world can control."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them.
Jobs told further from a glorious d'état, Wozniak and he almost pulled out, as they are in the middle of the night in the Vatican via Blue Box ringing with the Pope wanted to talk, while it as best they could to Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope himself to the phone.
As he has in the technology verliebte (and unprepared Bill Hewlett dispute):
At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, in order to build a frequency meters, he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone call received a Teilzeitjob jobs for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"It has had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated."
Later, Jobs one of the HP-staff, the research laboratories visited the company in Palo Alto, where he "the first desktop computers ever produced".
He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with wide brown master and I verliebte me in it.
I would climb to the top as a teenager at HP and this machine, and programmes for they write.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs about how spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career when he some Platinen einbaute, he was asked by a customer, the entire computer to assemble them.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the Zusammenbau and the extradition of ready-made equipment.
Later, when Apple does he remember the problems in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember very strong arguments... you schrien me that it would take five years [in order to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I was on, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we could build for $15. It was incredible credible.
On large companies that continue:
Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants in Stolpern clashed with their vision and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better Kopierer or printer, so what?"
They have the stock monopoly, so the company no more successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so these people [are], which will ultimately lead to the company and the product with which the people are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products, eradicated art, craft.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
It would be ten times greater, the Microsoft in the 1990s can be...
They have caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is plenty of craft art between a great idea and a great product... if this great idea, they change and grow."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
We must votes, certain things that you can't do, but electron, glass, robots, factories.
We must see 5,000 cases, these concepts, and they all together...
Ultimately, it amounts to the taste, it is that they are trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to bring these matters to you.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always in stealing shamelessly grandiose ideas.
Part of what made great Macintosh was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health legislation, adopts a court case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors in order to end the political part to discuss whether it is a challenge to the health law President Obama will hear, two of its judges, and finally there is Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, at a dinner attended by the firm gesponsort was that the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care have been adopted by Congress last year, a law that the conservative activists across the United States was the buzzword.
The judges agreed the hearing. Indeed, in March a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion, probably the result will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at a time when the court decision is announced, will be in full swing.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that the annual dinner of the Federal society, a veteran group, which is dedicated to the defense of conservative principles of law.
Another company that has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the process is enormous.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, including Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health reform
The guests of Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges attend events of the Federal society for years.
And this is not contrary to moral rules.
Indeed, to judge by the code of conduct, the actions of the lower federal courts.
They were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can Benefizveranstaltungen law near and other organisations to participate, with the judges no spokesman, guest of honour or according to programme a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity ranged from Scalia and Thomas on two of the case-related firms and companies with a massive financial interest in this to moral-and-government activists to alert.
"This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code belies the complaints of some judges lie, the court seems to play by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges and dinnierten won during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trial on court."
Their presence and their support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little concern for critics who say they are legal matter too easily with groups that are on the agenda, such as the Federal society, mix.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
But the Conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan is a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance came to court.
Its critics have urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias because they too involved in the defense of the law is to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
Boeing has orders record of 18 trillion dollars in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-type Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option for a further 20 aircraft.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It really is a rare news that a company with a mission about 50 of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for this 50 aircraft overall in a record sum of $18 billion.
Equally unusual is the principals of Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a forecast that was published on Monday, estimates the Chicago company that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion needed.
Boeing announced over the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order shall: 50 two standard Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer mission came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also, Boeing announced it 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to buy 20 more planes that the entire list price rise to 26 trillion dollars.
Then on Monday ordered according to Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, the fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft stands at more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said produce Dihora, stock market expert of Morning Star.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft, but a rise in oil prices, which is usually the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost items is not so bad, because the country is at a higher price.
This is important because they are less than other airlines tend to aircraft orders to cancel or postpone when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
Emirates confirmed the appointment of Boeing's leadership position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus SAS competitors to contain the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence after the customers and reach a higher specifically requested.
The Boeing-shares rose by 1.5% to $67,94.
Sister of Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claimed that the drug traffickers Fausto Vallejo opponents of the PRI, in the race for governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently their bid for the Office of the Governor of Muchoacan lost during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday, drug dealers had the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, the race for the governor's office in the western state won.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral processes and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our colleagues in the polls... you have occupied polling booths, road blockades constructed... and people responsible [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they want a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon appears to have narrowly beaten in the polls before the election day still.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise the winner Vallejo.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party PRD, which currently acting governor, was ranked Three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left-wing leadership for the presidential election in 2012.
Also Aureoles refused to recognize the provisional results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels to marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is, the country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan, in December 2006, a military-led offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor, a week before the election during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon killed and many candidates are out of fear for the local elections.
A victory for the PRI strengthens the party, no matter how distasteful the elections appear in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI in the race for the presidency will probably represent is Enrique Pena Nieto, of Vallejo congratulated from Washington and said: "I think that this victory us look boldly into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to aid in the rescue of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis to support a long-term downward trend in order to prevent the growth of Asian economies will slow down.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies in the world, "everything in your power" must do the recovery of the currency bloc either by the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the "detached" to the problems in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leaders and European resources through Asia, a long-term collapse of the global economy helps to prevent.
"We are all in the same boat."
"Therefore, any helpful, which can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may to some extent be protected, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union came in recent months in a severe debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs rose to dangerous and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging heavy debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging countries should join forces in order to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that any support Asia will be channeled through the IMF, said, however, that mutual agreements, such as the purchase of bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners in Asia offer greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India is going to do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, as its economy from falling exports and the drying-up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro zone remains volatile and turbulent remains," he said.
"We are facing big challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is a task, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves facing major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the US Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult, the 1.2 billion people in India to sell aid for Europe, of which more than 800 million from $2 or less a day on live.
"At some point they will find that the Greeks with 50 in retirement and vacation on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, a similar asked why India's reserves should be used in Greece, the numerous and well-paid workers in the public sector, with jobs in bad geleitetet, losses einbringenden institutions such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone "significant knock-on effects" on all of Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with economic growth to 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/is now threatening "the risk of gradation" because of the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets should "contingency plans" to prepare themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital to protect their Wortschaften.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence sector
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, as he previously warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon's to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon is already through cuts amounting to $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts to $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress does not end in the spending can achieve.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham,.
He said that a failure by Congress in reaching a budget agreement, leading to a so-called seizure will lead to 23% overall cuts and a freeze of many new projects.
"Such a large cut, implemented in such ill-considered way would most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot make three-quarters of a ship or buy a building - and other modernization efforts seriously hurt," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We were also forced to involuntarily by a large part of our civilian staff to separate and that the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to achieve this goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
The cuts were ultimately take the combat forces, "said Panetta.
"During the war time quotas in the anti-terror fight by the seizure not directly affected, would be a serious violation of the basic budget adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Staff attitudes have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring, to supporting the war."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments to war-time dealers, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she published Panettas letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly none that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators on a compromise the pressure will increase in the budget or demands, the Pentagon will be exempt from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, even though he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon's, and knows that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, Defense Minister graphic picture of a gloomy picture of what could face a military with skin, but without nuclear.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"There is an air without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"It is a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our global operational and Eingreiffähigkeit, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those who already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike fighter, a planned new bomb plane, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
The further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 billion dollars, but advocates say that it is an important next step is to build-up, so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
As we revealed a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies in their daily lives.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is concerned with the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penh State is accused of my EID's, because it has withheld allegedly reports, after which a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, on an open microphone mitangehört, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama towards claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies ruin careers and shaking countries.
The New York Congressman Anthony Weidner and Internetexhibitionist made a fool of himself when he renunciations in circulation, the very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused in the campaign finance violations in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one forgets that it has experienced the media circus that President Bill Clinton as he has during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied.
Stories of cheating in school and college examinations are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers to their students took the exam answers so that they themselves in their performance on tests any good.
Mentors who teach the opposite should send a message that lying and cheating OK.
We have seen how much deception?
As studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as lies.
Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting lie.
Lies to recognize lies uncover "to learn is that for every human being is important, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as host Aden, where the goal is to "property you!" To expose the deception is a serious know area that is based on scientific data over the past six decades of prestigious universities, the wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies were revealed.
Look into the eyes of a lie.
They stottern, stammeln zappeln suffused with, and not always.
But we should not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A geübter Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, something about the structure of the claim that the subtle facial expressions, question and timing.
I have spent several years, the science of comprehensive and ever-growing area of exposing. And it is clear that the ability to expose the deception is a modern, which is easy to learn and we find in our complex world helps, especially if the suspensions or the questioning of persons or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liar are very good people to assess their interests and to control their own emotions, and they sense intuitively, how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that people are more likely to lie than extrovertierte introvertierte people that men are more likely to "self-oriented" lies are than women whose lies more "to other guide" - typically, they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people reneging on its partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if a person has been revealed as a culprit, others feel less guilty, this person angelogen.
As you can see whether someone is lying?
First of all, by the normal behaviour of this person.
It is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It is a point of reference for later assessment of changes.
You see the attitude, the laughter, the Stimmqualität their attempt person.
They should know better, usually when someone constantly with the foot trippelt, so that they do not unfairly when he during a meeting with the foot trippelt.
Then you look at accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as a warning bell ringing, not as evidence of exposing.
People who grind to a halt, perhaps, if they try to remember their history, perhaps, their feet towards the door or in the direction they are starting to change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the cessation conversation," this deep, entspannende breathed out by others and the change in attitude that if all the hard questions are over.
Often mistakenly Fragende signal that a recruitment conversation is over, just after this relaxation after the cessation conversation.
You also look at the language of your attempt person.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was killed on live and a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distanzierende language: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if a vexed issue in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" if it is a vexed question: "Now... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... in good faith."
This is the answer, rather than objectively true reference, which often set the alarm bells ringing.
There is no magic means to expose of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which a exposing is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can be a victim of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan an oil pipeline is under threat from late US approval review
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico to delay, the trade unions and environmentalists angered calmed, is that the pipeline bauende companies trying to plan the project, so that we can go back to normal.
Trans-Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive areas of Nebraska Sandhills in diverting.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of Trans-Canada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, the territory in Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large under water, meide.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, on Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered may defer a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and said his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline, Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
In this regard, the pipeline would pass through six states.
Environmentalists they hate, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas who oppose the plan, weighing the laws, a departure from the region in the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation,.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Department requested a separate probe of the review process, which is focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, the Trans-Canada, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that has been charged, the original study, an inappropriate choice, because it is linked with Trans-Canada.
Patti LaBelle sued because they fear a small child allegedly forced to Erbrechen
A New York family claimed that the discos any-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of a building Tobsuchtanfall Manhattaner, of her small daughter so in fear that they fear.
The tirade of "Lady Marmalade" Sängerin made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk such fear that they "Persönlichkeitsänderungen, sleep disturbance" and "increased fear of strangers' rise, said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year, when the stage scar ITER Kevin Monk, his wife Rose Anna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve to a family trip wanted to leave.

The baby cried so much that it had to hand over, she said.
Later asked the family LaBelle in writing for an apology, but received no reply.
LaBelles lawyer and representative responded to calls in which was asked for an opinion.
The complaint is no closer to a certain damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he did not charge fees, and the family plan, the money they receive to help give children's cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle assumes responsibility for their behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially if a kindergarten teacher being shown towards the an 18-month-old baby in the arm."
Climatic adversity bremsten the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez in government, rose in Sinaloa unemployment and undeclared work, while the foreign investment decreased and the economy stagnated.
2011 is in economic history Sinaloas remembered, it is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, the self-described as the initiator of change and high hopes on the economic growth fueled by the government, but as a result of the climatic adversity can be no question of growth, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of dollars in losses in agriculture, but were in addition to the growth of the state economy close borders and in the first quarter year caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent This is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 per cent, which bremsend impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to one of the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable ("Go. Mexico's Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the Frosts were 582,000 hectares of agricultural land damaged what 78.03 percent completely and the remaining 21.07% partially destroyed. Affected mainly the vegetable, maize and chickpeas cultivation.
The decline in economic activity until November, in the Mexican state unemployment continues to rise and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed during the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment, because from January to March had 55,053 inhabitants Sinaloas no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population.

Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is based on several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the policy of public institutions declare indirectly the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts through the legislation to combat money laundering in Congress was adopted, because those who amass $banned way, it is not easy for them to work to invest or to use for anything," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people in the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, left, is decreased. This is due to the entry problems on the one hand, and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work. These people here and stay here looking for work, with high unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, given the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes according to INEGI 60.38 percent of employees who work in the country without into the coffers of the social security will be paid.
About unemployment and undeclared work, the low wages, the lowest throughout Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Intergovernmental Authority for work and social care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa, until September 5352 pesos; it is much less than the overall national average of 7375 pesos.

The debt
In the face of the economic crisis for the provincial government in July at the National Congress a loan of EUR 3,000,000,000 pesos to the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities should be invested. The country Congress approved an amount of EUR 200,600,000 pesos, until November, but had no positive effects of debt in any of the industries in the country.

The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well collide eingestimmte government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, the economy slowed more difficult and development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the Frosts. One of the main impact is a slower economy in movement is not sufficient to produce an economic dynamism, an acceptable flow of processes, products and services could produce, so this year we will finish well below our expectations," he said.

There is much to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a future that the efforts of the government to better track.

He stressed that the current government is making progress in the government.
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more. What I can say is that it was done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work lies ahead of it," he said.

The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of analogue to digital signals in recent years is one of the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN), the constitutional complaints from the Senate and House were filed against the presidential decree, under which the switchover from analogue to digital signals from 2021 must be brought forward to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes, the challenge to the law are required.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, took the view that the President Felipe Calderón have not exceeded his powers when he the legislative decree with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial television provided.
With this decision was launched by the Senate rejected constitutional dispute, because he did not obtain the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court is on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality could decide the law remains in force.
The project for the action that the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was suggested that the law decree unconstitutional, since for the radio and television regulations affecting the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the legislative decree the hierarchical principles and keep the bill would contradict.
Only Zaldivar voted in favour of the project, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument ranged from both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the law decree. After the adoption of the complaints the Minister Sánchez Cordero the legislative decree and was no longer in all activities for the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the debate on the project, for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the prime minister, did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government is not with general rules the measures the public administration should take to regulate.
"I do not believe that, if you do this, the independence of the regulator would be disrupted." It reminded that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons the central state government is responsible, because this is the state of affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes in recent years around the world, and it leads to a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increase in the quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the conversion, they said, was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digital age, a decision which was in the public interest, not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, said, "were the actions of the whole system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they included a group of characteristics of the Constitution in the hands of the central state government battery."
It called to mind that many countries around the world have already implemented the digital switchover, on the government, even though they have highly specialised facilities.
It could not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested legislative decree in the powers of Congress great reticence, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, "she said.

The Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Official State Gazette within the designated time with the argument that still objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court ruled Mexico (SCJN) on the local legislature's constitutional complaint and keep the voice of the state to the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal," because it does not have the right to 'veto or to decide against it. "

On Wednesday the new Italian government
Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy, in order that the new government, the crisis that Italy to the brink of economic Zusammenbruchs led to confront.
Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy, in order that the new government, the crisis that Italy to the brink of economic Zusammenbruchs led to confront.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that the Sunday appointed Monti on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would make the government.
It is expected that a majority will present special cabinet of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will assume office.
Monti said he would give the president the outcome of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to express my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times, stress," said the former EU Commissioner journalists.
Monti not explicitly endorsed the formation of a government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
"The framework is now well defined," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against the political and financial crisis, the cost of debt in an intolerable level.
The new, the former EU Commissioner Monti-led government needs to adopt a tough austerity package by the euro was called for politicians to regain the confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush to Monti, accelerated by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years have been burdened with 7% interest rate, which is the state in which Greece and Ireland have forced to request the European rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti with: "We said we would support this government after all."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy emerges from this emergency.
The chances of success were Monti by supporting the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, on Saturday had to resign as a result of the crisis, expanded significantly.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far, many of its members against a majority of existing government of technocrats, the Monti just is.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks, with his reference to a failure of Monti was a disaster, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations and youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday night's sitting round is to be completed.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, as a response to the crisis, an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion.
After recent revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost to the Italian government bonds back critical borders.
A bailout of Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government should be up to the next election, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians to give him time to implement the reforms instead than the elections.
Monti said he would like to politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this only from technicians should be a reference to their concerns in the face of pressure from the financial markets imposed procedure.
Political sources suggest that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties the inclusion of persons from political life is complicated.

"In Costa Rica to play is a dream to reality '
In an exclusive interview with Viva says the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam that the band is prepared, next Sunday in the National Stadium one of its best concerts.
More than 20 years, they were expected, but the band assured that a dream for them when they play in Costa Rica.
The assured the Bassist and founder of the group, Jeff Ament, Viva last week by Brazil from an exclusive-interview.
The band is in the South American part of their Tour to celebrate its 20-year existence, and on Sunday, 20, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they come from 7.30 p.m. in the national stadium, together with the band The X in Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
Read an excerpt from the interview, whose full transcript in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rica niche fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what it means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream that is for us.
This is only the second time that we in South and Central America, and so far, it is great.
I am just once on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will stay there a few days.
For us, it is exciting, our music out there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely; they are the closest possible days before the concert.
What does your your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years on our side.
We have almost 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica. Thank you, have been waiting for so long, and we are very sorry to have taken so long before we got here.
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have in the past 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you Costa Rica and its waves to surfing got?
Many of our friend, a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends are always on the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the outstanding areas for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have heard about it.
With a view to the Tour you giant shows with many songs.
Do you have any plans for the event in Costa Rica?
We have never played there, we are also no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want a few songs from each album play and our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
She never repeats your repertoire.
Why?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play. Each like another song, so the decision, which we will play is not easy.
If we have two or three songs that we no longer have long played into the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and they come as a surprise to us, because they remind us of the reasons why we have these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this Tour celebrates its exporters twenty years of history.
If you look back, you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
First of all, I believe that none of us are presented in a great rock band to play, and over 20 years, which looks like a dream.
We are also continuing to this blessing and find it great to still be able to make music together.
Let us and we are excited about music.
We are lucky to be able to go places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What was it for you, at the birth of Grunge participated actively?
It has always been an honour to this group of large band.
We are good with the people of Sound Guard, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.
It is surprising and rather unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured, part of the Seattle-group.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guard at the Tour. We look forward, still to be friends with all of them and it is to our credit, part of this Seattle-Sounds that have arisen.
It is very unusual for a band like the companies with the same musicians together for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us. This alone is much more time than many band survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and we care about each other.
We are all close friend why musical avenues that each individual freedom to experiment.
The other is a familiar and whose music. It could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, konntet their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a.
How is a balance?
The way we are grown, has made it easier to find a balance.
We are certainly not too often on Tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
Until you consider that the people because of the music, it reminds you that you are the music and what it has created, must respect without hell-bent a famous rock star. It has never interested anyway.
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love bone?
I think we have very good songs written and at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never issued a record.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), with the band were friends, when I hear a song or photos, I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work together to laugh and music and football, and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that she knows their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and the band have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and the band liked best. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live. This is exciting.
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he chooses.
Bassist and by whom you got to be affected?
By so many +
Among the first to come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the Bassisten, I like to talk about.
How has it Pearl Jam managed to keep alive the Grunge, although it is not a fad?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the band that I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Guard, Nirvana and everyone else who was at the same time, if they still are important, I think it is great, because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem a bit lightly, but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe as a very dark songs, even though they have something positive.
Both came to me to tears when I heard they played as Ed. There are very dark songs.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happens in your life - for example, if you have a family member or a friend loses, it affects your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs embody the clear for me.
However, I also believe that it is a happy person and still dark music.

The 72-year-old Fujimori to 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his government (1990-2000) prison, has a number of diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal doctor, said the television that Fujimori for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas would investigate the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he would not because he is innocent.
It has been operated on four times for tongue cancer and he has lost 18 kg weight. Other diseases such as a serious erosive Gastritis, a Zyste in a person's pancreas cells, kidney stones, high blood pressure and Durchblutungsprobleme in the legs, was the doctor.
Fujimori is since September 2007 in the detention centre dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía.
In April 2009, he was to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people through the death squad of the Peruvian army, while his government was secretly.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by the Uruguay's President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneur starts on Tuesday her visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and the region to discuss political issues
Mujica is next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, which according to the Uruguay, president of the peak of his ausgebuchten schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the president of the South American country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica support for Calderón's regarding the incident with France, as the French leader Nicolas Sarkozy at the summit of the G20 in the French city of Cannes, the South American country on a list of tax havens.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to those countries that are still as tax havens, from the international community. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a question during his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has since November, the presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January of this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid the duplication of orientation with the South American country.
The government of Uruguay has, in recent years, the reality of agreements to exchange tax information to speed up from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to be deleted, are countries that not all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level since 2004, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, a growing freight exchanges between the two countries.
The plumber schnurrbärtige enters with "Super Mario 3D Land" the third dimension
Super Mario has worked tirelessly for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: In "Super Mario 3D Land", he is fighting for the love of the girls in Stereo-technology.
The game, which this month on the Ladentheken around the world, from the beginning to the properties of the 3DS portable Konsole Nintende, which played without special glasses can be deemed appropriate.
"Mario is the figure who have to say how the Stereoskopie works without glasses," assured Omar Alvarez, the person responsible for the Nintendo specialist press in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said, "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which from the outset has been developed for this Konsole" because, until now were success article as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations of existing title.
The spokesman of Nintendo stressed that, although it was deemed "Super Mario 3D Land" an "affordable" video game is that a rapid, allow liquid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games in an objective: The first part is "easy" to the less geschckten users.
After that, the experts on the various game levels, the increasingly difficult, "a second round turn."
Moreover, the user in real time between a "D" or an aggressive, only the depth of the action, choose to overcome the obstacles, without victims of "optical effects," however, is deemed to be played.
This foray into the Super Marios dreidimensionale world also means the return of the figure to a portable Konsole, which since 2005, is no longer the case.
With this video game zwinkert Nintendo fans of the saga and repeated the recipe for success of recent spending: The schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome gespickte platforms with threats to the Princess Peach.
However, the players on news of the movements of the environment, the guises and the enemies - and a "spielbaren" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillos extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced Tuesday that he would the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that it is in the United States for conspiracy to money laundering, furthermore, US $70 million.
So that was the end of the process, on the request of the United States to extradite Portillo, so that they can be brought to justice.
In a press conference, Mr Colom, his decision based upon the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision address court has ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he and his government has not interfered in court decisions and all extradition requests, of which he was informed, was granted.
But Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a government act that, if all legal and constitutional bodies to condemnation of former Staaatspräsidenten (2000 -2004) are exhausted.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth International Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was for the misappropriation of 120 million Quetzales within the Department of Defense during his government acquitted. This negotiation was the extradition, but the Minister, contradiction and fueled the case anew.
Trinijove has 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion helped
The organisation was to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of social welfare organisation Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter-century were 6,000 young, supported by the social exclusion of vulnerable people in order to overcome their difficult situation.
In addition, hundreds of jobs created for this social group.
To mark the anniversary was yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings by Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people, balance sheet.
In 1986, the city was Trinijove quarter Trinitat Vella launched with the aim of young people with low education, without work, with drug problems, the risk of margins were threatened, to help.
At yesterday's ceremony in Sant Andreu, many leaders of agencies and institutions involved in these 25 years worked with the club.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election time, documented the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the autonomous region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Mr Pujol attended the ceremony of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current Left-Green councillor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current resolution minister for social and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the social structure of the savings bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove in very difficult times, has been launched and that today's times no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far, "a good basis."
For the president of the Generalitat Trinijove is a model, the fight against difficult circumstances and people in difficulty is hope.
"The economic crisis is for the club and the work he does nothing new," he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held, was cleared
The homeowners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building of the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 House occupying forces yesterday afternoon left the building without resistance.
All the signs are that the nightmares of the neighbours of the House No 51 in the street Balmes an end.
Twelve people left the building voluntarily yesterday afternoon that they illegally occupied and huge festivals in which they had organised the neighbourhood to despair. The evacuation was made on judicial order without any police intervention.
The evacuation was replaced the door closed, in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on will be controlled access," confirmed the house manager.
The house occupants, 11 of the 13 homes had occupied the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply, and they had the walls angemalt and all types of waste, particularly cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors were huge parties, which lasted up to two days, and the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which also damage.
The winner, Maria Pantinat Europe Press said that their business since the beginning of the home occupation has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the House occupying their unfair competition, because they were selling the drinks three euros, while those in the disco 10 euros.
Moreover, the owner of the Freizeitlokals due to disorder by the neighbours have been reported, according statement of the noise from the visitors, but the disco stemming from the Hausbesetzern and especially the guests of the festivities, which had been organized, and according to the disgruntled neighbours in recent weeks longer and longer.
The leaders of the disco declared that the harassment was so great that they agree with the owners of the building, for the last nine months to pay no rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that they have in the last few weeks have received more complaints from neighbors.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to evacuate immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and come down the city quarter.
He said that before the summer just one floor of the building was occupied, but that the house occupants in recent months in all the floors of the building and almost all of the homes were in some, it was even thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the impunity and the anti-social behaviour to intervene in the building."
Yesterday there was another building in the city of quarter Nou Barris of the Catalonian police.
3.30 p.m. approached the police the streets Montral No 35 after they received a call from a neighbor, who had watched as four people in the building to intrude.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola again in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration on the promotion of their Schmähschrift Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York in comparison.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and below (Sea).
The classification Collserolas plays as a natural park with this idea.
Now no longer served as an example of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs.
So far, it was when the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola purported.
Undoubtedly, a gateway to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone has, gates to the countryside.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste in the lift,.
And it is this fact provides the fuel for a rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
"It is necessary for Roldán," after the attack on the coast on the "front in the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held.
"We should start from the principle that Barcelona largest park of the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "expresses the architect, for the title of" gates of Collserola "a" lexikalische case ": We must not" as access to a park, but as a limit of areas where action is needed. "
Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "some risks".
Risks due to the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today brings" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the Forum their "swan song".
The first fear is its own limits on what can be developed.
"Something is always limit, the next step down", i.e. to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [in response to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is close to the issue, says simplifies the side of Collserola towards Valle Ana, "can be understood as a park towards Barcelona not" for purely topografischen reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study of Patronat de Collserola which are not "should fall on deaf ears," even though he was grateful to the City, his body has given the opportunity, on this project, "from the first moment".
In addition, it says that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects of the debate, although his "doubt" to say whether this technical profile launched the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says, "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: "There were 16 contests in the cross-cutting tender," he says, "on the axis mountains and sea, but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
That, at least in his case meant that he participated in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors also collide.
In his view, the city should absolutely guarantee that the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so, a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal, is freed
After 72 days of silence Bevollmächtigte liberated of the casino Red the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal released after the Bevollmächtigte of casino Red him before the Second Criminal of Distrikts that the trial of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail, has awarded.
After the attack on the casino Royal, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the casino Red, a series of photos and video clips of Manuel Jonás, he allegedly forced to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration the secret operation of the betting House approved.
According to the complaint, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of panistischen mayor, on 2 September was arrested for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was at the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he was 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the officials of the Ministerio Público the offences of corruption and organised crime was rejected.
On 19 October, he was in the detention centre in Cadereyta because he allegedly the owners of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos had bribed, he remained only a few hours in the Mittelsicherheitstrakt because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to trial as an inmate of urban prison in San Nicolás de rid Garza.
On 25 October, he was the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of Distrikts, Jorge Yánez, sent to a prison regulation. This found that after nearly two months of investigations sufficient evidence to Jonás to speak for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to be able to offer this in return.
This Monday asked the Bevollmächtigte of casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez the Judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor sentence, which is why he is in the coming hours will be released.
During the court hearing asked Ramiro Arias, the officials of the Court affiliated Ministerio Público, García Gómez, whether the damage was repaired and the owner of the betting house his forgiveness. But the lawyer's name.
According to the Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal free. Also here cannot be lodged appeals against the process, there is no compensation.
After the hearing of the agent of the betting House against 3.50 p.m. Bretón Larrazabal was immediately released.
The justice secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the urban prison in San Nicolás de rid Garza, Jonás to announce that he had been acquitted and his case filed away.
He also informed him about the judicial order for the immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details on the plane crash, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y journey - SCT (Secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) informed that the findings of the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed, pointing out that the helicopter with all its unversehrten structure directly against the soil is absolutely, without the pilot to have an emergency evacuation.
At a press conference said Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport that the pilot had confirmed before the launch, the weather conditions are suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres altitude contact with trees, and the helicopter lost the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and it all conditions for the transportation of personnel.
He also said that the investigations in the area where the plane came down, no helicopter parts were found.
"In any aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the premium was the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and it all conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
It is a priority at the moment, the survey results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, maybe even a year.
For its part, has assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y public Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and ancillary services in Mexico) that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial premium air travel at the speed of the plane and flown to a soft Abhang had fallen.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the collision was a normal flight operations."
At a press conference was the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation.
View flight:
In accordance with the air standards, it was a flight to the rules of the term flight, which means that the team during the flight and on the ground have had sufficient view.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the long flight towards the border between Mexico City and the Mexico-state, some low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team because of the clouds lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley had selected.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps it has neither a far above the impact on the plane or a deviation from the flight route.
Verstreuung the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
To date the information available suggests that the helicopter from gerader and seitlicher aufgeprallt direction.
The pattern of dispersed plane debris suggest that the helicopter with his unversehrten aufgeprallt structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion.
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of an accident can offer either on fire or explosion.
The latest survey results indicate several soil contacts.
In the studies were on site at a height of aircraft parts 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is a Schrägung abschüssig and points from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to rupture.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several soil contacts.
After a minuziösen search in an area that is on the field at the scene of an accident abgesperrten went dispersed aircraft parts could not be found, on the assumption that the-bodied aircraft structure on the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity in
The Social Security Institution of Mexico is leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - Mexico's Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for medical research, focus biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro regions Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that an interdisciplinary team composed of doctors, Krankenpflegern, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud pública (INSP) and the Centro regions de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can on sports fields of IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 a.m. tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) began and since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue.
If the aim of 500 to 600 persons inquiry is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main town of Districts) and continued in Morelos (in the north of the main city Districts) completed.
He said that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people on the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents nutritional fill out questionnaires.
You will also be questions about their physical activity and their family disease in history to risk factors that lead to diabetes and renal insufficiency may have to control.
He also led to the investigation of the aforementioned Saturdays persons measured (weight, height, Taillenumfang) to control their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said, this would take place at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys to 77 per cent and the girls with obesity increased by 47%. The obesity has risen dramatically," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico from the other international differences.
He stated that a (e) (in) on average 65 per cent indianisch-American, European and 30% to 5% of African descent, which is in the genes, with diabetes and obesity, '.
More generally, he said the genetics of obesity in the inability to express the surplus of detainees to burn energy (calories), so that it will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefit for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of children, were found, whether such a degree of obesity and obesity.
It would even the presence in the neck and dark Hautfalten Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolism disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated.
All information will be treated as confidential and parents in writing of the doctors told the doctors say parents beat them all measurements and lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible, lack of exercise, the lack of movement in everyday life, for most of the day in front of the television and transport to spend, rather than short track walking.
The high caloric intake, which means that an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and total carbohydrate content (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and genetics in this research project is to be analysed.
Asphalt of the UNAM prevented blow holes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte resilient to the mix of weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Would the signs that the effective, respected, it would not be necessary, nearly 200,000 blow holes to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of Asphaltbelags if appropriate, the number of blow holes significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation "blow holes from a technical point of view," he to mark the International Year of Chemistry, he was aware that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing similar to the asphalt mix, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and the incidence of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene together, they give the effective his typical zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behaviour of Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, at 120 ° C, it is very tough liquid and nearly 50 ° C, while he is fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations changes," led the chemical engineer.
The researchers the FQ said, the streets of Mexico City had a flexible effective by a majority of six material classes together, of which the last three asphalt.
Among the top layers would wear a layer of asphalt from small, asphalt gebadeten there and then entrenched stones.
Each piece this decay class, whether in asphalt gebadet.
If the vehicles travel and forces that produced this class provides a good forces in the effective distribution.
"If it modified asphalt, would distribute the forces is even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the wear class," he tells us, "will make a final class, the so-called Tragschicht from tiny stones, i.e. from sand, also in asphalt gebadet.
Since this class in contact with the car tyres, they need greater mechanical power than the wear and it must produce friction.
This effective receives the most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is, must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular, humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into consideration, above all the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of wear class.
If the site is wet, filthy water in the class and is just difficult again. This causes a softening of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of blow holes.
If a blow hole occurs, "he said," will begin the deck class City during the wear class only then will be affected, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) said that the vehicle load another important reason for the incidence of blow holes. Therefore the thickness of each class of the surface is in relation to the vehicle weight, and it must be ensured that, in order to prevent frequent blow holes this rule is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research in coming, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries are already on the market, and the blow holes simply and without the use of high temperatures could repair.
What was the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that this sector that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia did not.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the winners podium, a silver crown and the band, expelling them as new Miss Colombia, on the show.
With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar in itself, it's Department is already at 14 Miss title and Melina is required by the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, almost in the hands of the crown. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question today, many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a big favorite in every projection had shown that they had all the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing the Queen of the police and the Rostro Jolie of vogue Mejor elected titles, including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.
The first factor, as it applies to the decision of the jury, they failed to appoint the first is that the answer to the question "What book has the most impact on you and why?" She of Martín Gómez Carreta Literaria Leamos by Murillo was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca the author replied:
"I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of become more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood," The small Prince 'is a very deep book.
At the moment, I read "crime and Punishment ', it is a book of universal culture that we all should read: I read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book that' passion 'means.
One answer, which met with skepticism, firstly because of the term 'more civilised' and, secondly, because it does not specifically said how each of them had influenced their 'book.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, calm and to feel happy with the outcome, "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all people: Please read a bit of 'The small Prince', it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle ausgebrannt.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite, all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to all prices was given (gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), "jealous of the other candidates had made what the Queen stresste, therefore not shine on the stage."
As we noted in its first presentation in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony.
Although they both appeared safe, it lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico display.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "como en casa 'in RCN Channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned the Miss," shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, but not Queen. "
In addition, Valle at the end of the press from the road - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, which ultimately could not persuade the essence of the National beauty contest.
There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were a woman for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the physical and social sense, insist that they even before the participation in the competition had worked on projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with its defects of Derriere and fibrosis, her in the stomach area noted, had sinned. But this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina not the best body that it better, "but the problem with the fibrosis belly, which for me, to be honest, hard to say was, put their point number on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca had the surgery, which they had been subjected to.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should let them correctly.

This was the work of the doctor, the corpse of Alfonso Cano Identified
A Lophoskopist from Cali, as the man who "Alfonso Cano" identified in history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On 4 November was a Lophoskopist of investigative unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Revolucionarias de Colombia Armadas - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, had Eliazar González call this week, a man from the Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations.
At the beginning of his career working in communities of Chocó González, where he often five days in the jungle had to go in order to achieve the place where the bodies were that he should identify.
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary courses specialized he Lophoskopie, this is the study of the skin, the friction is evident in the land.
In the week of the use of the so-called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out, put clothes for at least three days.
Nothing much awaited him.
Friday night, he flew by helicopter from Palmira after Cauca.
He knew he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, could be, so he should the ten finger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But with the Untersuchungste when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this was the images that he had seen in the media, not in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed as a pawn of the area, no glasses and was very much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a lamp and a pocket Pflanzkelle Eliazar compared with the fingerprints of the corpse on the Abdruckblatt.
He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano".
This was still the same night originating from Puerto Tejada men responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, say that it is the leader of the FARC.
Search for clues
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was the recognition that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano" paid, very important.
Not many people know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, a key factor in the dissolution of a crime can be.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support investigations into accusations of murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the person arrested.
In her arrest many criminals are false identity papers, or they are not.
We are taking the fingerprints and are looking for these in the database.
The researchers told us that he is in a theft of a piece of wall had to pull out of a house, because the thief had precisely at this point with his hand when he was a aufgestützt with jewellery and money full gestopften Safe herauszog.
"Walls are difficult because their surface for fingerprinting are inadequate, but in this case we have the imprint of the whole hands and the offender, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints can also be exonerated or murder suspects.
Recently, one death, surrounded by bottles of spirits.
The investigation was suspected that a family member tatverdächtig could be, and indeed was a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer, so it is with the place where the offence was committed in context.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen the object."
When they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a band on the carriage.
The prints are then sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to Personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it in the TV series presented SCI.
As gold is not all that glitters is not everything it touches turns to a fingerprint.
Nevertheless, it can be used, if you make a comparison.
The "outraged" call on the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters emerged in tents in the Zuccotti-room together.
A large part of the evacuation order came in and changed its location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement of Ocupy Wall Street this Tuesday called the authorities in New York, as they tried again with a court order, to enter the Manhatten-place after the dawn of the space had been evacuated and were trying a different place in the Big Apple.

"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to campen Square, we are in a different place together and the battle with legal means to continue the return to Zuccotti, sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Movement "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray said that the response of the "outraged" at the evacuation of their tent camp directly by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York had been ordered by a court, where the judge Lucy Billings to issue an order that the forced evacuation of the place, and the protesters' tents.
Moreover, occupied the "outraged" a new park, which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, and property of Trinity Church.
The place they could fill at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray no exact figures. He told the news agency Efe, including several journalists have seen in handcuffs.
The organization stated that it had hundreds of people here at the time, in which a group of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police arrived.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti-room (a site in private property) closed pending a court hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday, and where the legality of the dawn held clearance to be analysed.
Some of the workplace-driven demonstrators wore photo copies of the court order in themselves and distributed them. They gave them some policemen who guarded the place, with "some small clashes", as Bray reported that had reported that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities, members of Occupy Wall Street to the workplace and the use of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation and ban the protesters and their tents and other things that they had previously used in the park."
Mayor Bloomberg before the press clearly that this court order the re-opening of the place for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them once again with tents and Schlafsäcken in this place.
The mayor defended himself in the dawn's clearance of Zuccotti-square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and it was decided that because the protesters appeared "against the law."
Bloomberg said that he had the order for the evacuation of the place, because this is "in a place had turned to the people, not one, but to break the law and, in some cases, damage to other people," because "some shops have received threats" and "residents began to worry about their quality of life."
"The clearance in the dawn was very attractive and shows that Bloomberg basically on the protection of financial interests and not the protection of the interests of American workers is interested in," added the spokesman for the movement, the mayor anschuldigte "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought about it, "major action" on Thursday, along with community organizations and unions in the two months that the protests since 17 September now time to remember.

Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5%, thanks to the domestic consumption and stop the cycle of free fall from the beginning of March
Since the last March was paralyzed Japan's economy, which is still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake that einmündete into a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster that Japan has experienced the second world war.
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo rated the material damage to 300,000 dollars, a blow that despite the difficult global economic situation seems to weaken.
After three quarters of fall, the details of the gross domestic product between July and September, finally to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% for the year hochgerechnete rate.
The measured value in the second quarter of the business year starting in Japan in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly by the machinery sales for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami-ravaged areas.
Indeed, the company increased its investment by 1.1% compared to the drop of 0.9% for investments, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
Yet the real change based on the Japanese economy not only from Keynesian Anstößen who take advantage of the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.
Japan is particularly woke up, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by the increased spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen, Japan's currency - in one of the "haven currencies" of investors before the debt crisis in the euro zone and the bleak forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that as a tombstone in the accounts of the export business.
With a tougher currency are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy on the health of the major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September on the listing of the yen.
While the markets remain the peripheral EU countries under siege, Yoshihiko Noda, the government remains vigilant.
"We must pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very aufheiternd.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most of the Member States in September clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development had rejoined.
The indicator of the turning points ahead of the world economy, brought to light that the greatest economic potential would put the brakes on.
Because he fell by four-tenths to rid 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below the average value of 100, after about eight-tenths of 99.13 points has fallen.
Athens is again doubts
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the high-driven risk premiums of the peripheral countries and has become widespread insecurity early Greece further into the labyrinth that from the major European debt crisis hitherto.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine belief of the political forces, will slow by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that his appointment agreed a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, the new austerity measures and not support his call new elections on the planned date of 19 February will withdraw.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October have been taken," assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government will peak.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, to reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but nothing else."
The Conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the body, the 8,000 million, the Athens urgently needed, entsperren. He made it clear that he has no commitment on the implementation of the austerity measures would approve.
But the European Commission, which is due to the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum is still confused, confirmed again yesterday, at their request is here to stay: The economic aid would not sign if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" sign.
The economy ministry spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" to come back to Athens, in order to discuss with the new government, "what for the payment of the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million euro "is needed," although there is still no definitive date.
The Greek knot has for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope '
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain has a dominant position in the world in the role of Kleinstfinanzierungen achieved. "
The Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain in the last two decades in the world for the second donor for the means of international cooperation, whose "essence" is based on the fact that it is a "tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people."
The Queen weihte yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. It was convinced that there was "no doubt" that that these types of deals "absolutely essential" would be the United Nations set by 2015 millennium goals and "especially the goal, the number of people with incomes of less than $1 a day, live below the poverty line."
Spain "continues to" on the extension of the beneficiaries network "until the last corner of the world, and it is through this task responsibly," said the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have many successes" and "there are many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not just a forum for debate, but also a platform to push "two fundamental objectives."
The Queen said that it would seek, until the end of the year 2015,175 million poor families should have access to these services and that 10 million of these households exceed the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit is in Spain and the rest of the world by Muhammad Yunus' years initiated way ", the Queen Sofia as an" act of justice and recognition ".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "admirable idealists who is committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work for 15 years ago, when the Queen after Bangladesh went to the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed by a year later, the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At all, "we are seeing a steady progress," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project their yesterday the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as an "advocate of the poor".
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her presentation by the House to take part in the debate and the search for solutions in the fight against poverty animierte.
"Ethical imperative '
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, they stressed that it was a mistake to aid in times of economic boom, because it was a "lasting commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that the micro-credits "a serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty was", and that the governments of the industrialised countries are now "more than ever," according to unified criteria would have to work, and will not allow that solidarity falls victim to the crisis.
For Spain, the micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "success," "marginalized" people, "the always closed doors," "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, said the present in a city, "their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity" to be opened.
The CDU proposes that the EU president elected by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, in particular to those activists enough that the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The Bureau of the European Commission proposed presidential motion was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had just nine voted against ten had abstained from the vote.
The standing ovation lasted several minutes because of their Interventionserlässen first, Angela Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro-minded finance minister, no doubt.
The main idea of Chancellor - as well as the Antrage - following slogan: The answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe peace means, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly from the euro."
The Chancellor is "time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be through the control of the European Union, reinforcing the overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone, and this could be expressed in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote resulted "in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is definitely one of the request for proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 rapidly in this revolution some: Groβ Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority of the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing Board under the weight of individual economies rejected what appears to be an awakening of Germany's position.
To reassure the climate within their party thoughtful Chancellor has therefore reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has not tried to their Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty to win, which would criticise the arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the Euro-application of the importance of "Franco-German friendship" a clause, Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this recalls that Leipzig two centuries ago in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army.
What represents reports of fraud in sick?
After the family subsidies are now sick UMP and government reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, a family allowance to pay and a speech on this - since 2007, been recurrent theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
To accompany this attack by the desire, the economy is in a tough test, on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, wants the majority of workers ill reports.
Start with the economic objectives: The government is seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick notification of workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of their monthly income.
A Maβnahme which, according to the newspaper, "Les echoes" provoke anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.
And with a different Maβnahme rather symbolic nature go hand in hand: The state officials a unvergüteten Karenztag event for the disease (so far are there for them, in the three Karenztagen Gegensatze in the private sector, no Karenzfrist).
Meanwhile, in the discussion of these issues are also cranked up the majority of the fraud issue, this time on the abuse is associated with Arbeitsabsenz targeted.
"Checks will be far more important, and furthermore, these rückzuvergüten, if that is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent activity in the areas of ill requests a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, already the subject of constant observation since 2002 and political offensive operations, the most commonly have borne fruit.
The French are not sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
But first we dwell on the nationwide paragraphs.
According to the country were CNAM health insurance fund in 2006, more than EUR 237 million days compensation paid off.
Gemäβ of Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, the days of compensation in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of health spending.
This figure fell 46% on maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube that heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days.
An average of concealing certain differences: Another in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40,000, French workers said, no single Krankentag.
Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of ill requests in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than elsewhere, inability to work.
In 2010, the two researchers of the French, the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 global Absenzquote (justified) oszillierte away or otherwise, in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in ill reports is a tiny proportion of undeclared work.
With regard to the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ.
Since 2002, encouraging the legislation means that it controls on sick systmatische reports, the 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the lost 285 of past, short-term sick reports that heiβt in 37,050 cases, "unjustified or too long."
The systematic controlled ill reporting cases of more than 45 days in duration was 1.2 million 11% of "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, the heiβt 132,000.
Overall, this is 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who made an ill.
A paragraph that only a weak Ausmaβ compared with, for example, those of undeclared work represents.
According to the UMP deputies Dominique Tian, author of a published in July Sachberichts regarding this issue, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation at last.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece has a new adjustment programme to absorb its economy.
This has had on Monday, 14 November the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, add the fact that his government from the Union acknowledged one hundred days was not adequate for the job.
"The efforts to bring about a comeback of the economy to continue, we need to support our European partners, as well as a new programme to budget adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech in Eröffung the debate on the confidence vote by Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the occasion of the euro summit decisions on 27 October was the "primary task" of the new government, with the participation of the country within the euro zone "at risk", he added.
Consequently, M. Papademos planned, the deficit of the country "to 9% of GDP between now and the end of the year, after this in 2010 and 10.6% 15.7% in 2009.
The rights rejected the new Sparmaβnahmen from
Antonis Samaras, leader of the right-wing, had on Monday gave its approval to the approved Maβnahmen in terms of the already escape from the debt crisis designed attempt, however, said that his party is not an additional Sparmaβnahme erkären prepared.
"We are not in favour of new Maβnahmen vote," he said at a meeting of his party New Democracy MEPs.
He was the target of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as to the fight against the waste was hostile to any policy, however, the economic recovery would stop.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks betrauter EU Commissioner, which had prevented that the IMF and the EU the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties on whose support the planned release Maβnahmen, Antonio Samaras responded that his word is enough and he is under pressure from Auβen would sign.
Euthanasia to be legalised and begleiteter Freitod, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada shows
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder worked together for the best palliative money, and that the cancer alone.
The Canadian company is living in a state of denial about the death.
Only 9% of Canadians are really important, with their doctor to talk about conditions under which they wish to die and making arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, in the six experts were involved in a variety of disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body recommends the government to amend the penal code so, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election is, in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent company EIU, the death of Erdballes quality in 40 countries had compared with each other.
Although Canada is placed in the 10th grade, the study noted that "the rate of health care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to raise the subject of death."
Medical care or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us which of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts.
And despite the majority of Canadians who wish to die at home, but ultimately die 68.6% of those in hospital.
Across the country, the rate is viewed with 86% of deaths that occurred in hospital in Quebec.
In the sensitive question about euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report's conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert, no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, to make concessions.
But now, according to the experts who have inspected gleichermaβen all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide legalised decriminalising or have no proof that such a decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application, the practice of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, we meet a lot more cases of such violations, particularly in countries where begleiteter suicide legalised euthanasia and not, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is illegal."
"Begleiteter suicide in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us that carried out in 2010, according to an Angus Reid survey already 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert because they believe that this would allow it to people at the end of their life journey to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of legalisation of euthanasia does not mean that the message that the lives of older or disabled people less value besäβe.
With regard to the people who already have an assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents to the view that they should not be prosecuted.
What maintenance or cessation of resources in patients, the situation is less clear, as the author of the report.
They also lay in its recommendation list suggests that the criminal law should be indicated that the possibility of funds for a legal opposition have not been as criminal should apply.
The panel of experts also calls for professionals in the health-care task should be trained, a possibility of funds at the end of life to be respected, and this without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and medical treatment schmerzlindernder worked together on the best palliative funding, and that the cancer alone.
Finally, the body on the already in the Canadian institutions to far-reaching health care means to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen, this at least to consider, as these nor the euthanasia intended to reduce physical pain and bezögen on the same procedure.
Other experts expressed reservations
Some experts in the field of health care already have reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Council Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health care law, has signed the attitude of the report, among other things, experts as "extreme", as this practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stages have no borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who lives tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him in his suicide to help," Deschamps Council yesterday a summary of the report had looked at.
Council Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appeared to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values, the social Gewirke society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health law, also has "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report expressed as "pro-euthanasia-manifesto" titulierte.
Margaret Somerville, the member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which suicide legalised euthanasia and begleiteter, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.

The United States has, for its part, the "intensification of consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions taken by the Arab League and the European Union begrüβt.
"International community, the United States, European Union, Arab League and countries such as Turkey, given the repression in Syria, an ever more fiercely tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.

At a press conference was the Syrian Auβenhandelsminister Walid Moallem, however, believe that the country is heading to the end of the crisis. "
He has, in fact, with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its tasks, what his assessment after a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added under the rhetoric, "forged plot against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria is investigating the Arab League is now a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media, as well as military observers in the country.
The French Auβenhandelsminister Alain Juppé was also in favour of the deployment of UN observers to civilians from repression of the regime that after him in his "paranoia" einkapselt, schützend.
A auβerplanmäβige Neuversammlung the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat, the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November Krisenaustieg, especially the controversial, projected withdrawal of military forces from besieged cities, as well as the release of imprisoned protesters.
The Russian Auβenminister Sergei Lavrov, the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "incorrect" to the endorsement of any sanctions against Damascus, Syria although China is already on the implementation of the crisis exit plan had warned.

Monti calls on the markets with patience and sacrifice in Italy
Mario Monti, future Italian leader of the markets has a little more time for his staff to create and implement a programme that "victims" abfordere, during the last months of Berlusconi government regain lost creditworthiness.
The former EU Commissioner, yesterday before today's clash of trade unions and employers a negotiation with the political parties.
It was his job to convene a cabinet to parliament, which is relatively strict from external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of a major programme with a number of victims," Francesco Mr Nucara, Member of the many smaller, parliamentary groups participating in the talks after he met with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait for geäuβert, Mario Monti Parliament until Friday a vote of confidence is to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will of M. Monti's presentation culminate a deletion list, which undoubtedly of a dozen of ministers and the head of state Giorgio Napolitano rich.
M. Monti describes the nervousness of the stock market and bond markets, their time.
In a democracy, there are certain deadlines, "a government and prepare for a government program, said in the statement that it seie" sure that the markets are gedulig and reasonable show. "
His appointment by the President was first begrüβt by the markets, but the unrest had stepped out again, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister should have a predominantly from technocrats existing staff, although he had pointed out, like "politicians".
The new government should only until 2013, the date of the next general elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, should the new government until Friday the confidence of Parliament.
M. Monti has since the start of his role obliged, in all urgency to work in the spirit of the objective, Italy on the "new players" in Europe.
A spokesman for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis to the Italian economy even taking into account the new government does not change."
The EU is convinced that Rome his goal of balancing the budget in 2013 despite the apprehended in these last months is not going to achieve savings, especially new Härtemaβnahmen requested.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the leaders' of Italy, who will meet on Tuesday to Monti, there is also the need to stimulate the economy, "as a country that has no record of growth, the deficit figures may not respect."
M. Monti, for his competence and independence as an EU Commissioner (1994-2004) is known, is a "epochal change" in Italy after 17 years' Berlusconismus ";" professor "symbolises the" challenge of trustworthiness "and a" different Italy, "the editorial writers.

President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy from now until April 2012 for 200 billion euro government bonds has to pay.
Russian scientists helps the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran with a nuclear weapon case detonator, to develop confirmed on Monday, an American NGO specialised, nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS advises the outcome based on the recent report by the International Agency for Atomic Energy Security AIEA, as well as other, emanating from the UN agency documents to identify this scientist.
Last week the AIEA had their "serious concern" at a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the study of AIEA eingehendem documents from ISIS advises the 1934 Danilenko had apparently born since the beginning of the 1960s over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Urals) worked by explosion and was produced in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 and 1991, he should have left the centre, in order to set up a company in Kiev, the "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine to contact.
Before his return to Russia, he then from 1996 to 2002 to an Iranian programme.
In its last report mentioned the AIEA "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear explosive system" through the work of foreign experts had been supported, not only in this technology äuβerst seie familiar, but beyond that, as a State Member of the agency told his entire professional career on vital at this technology directly on military nuclear energy programme worked his country of origin.

Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes and offences directed against Muslims are from 2009 to 2010 has risen by 50%, whereas other racially or religiously motivated violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday in the same period fell either easy or very low.
According to this data is the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% drop-wing crimes against Jews, as well as a global increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and offences had been recorded.

"Human Rights First, had long time on stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes as serious Gesetzesverstoβ against human rights should be considered," added Paul Legendre, an official of the organization.
"The US government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added under assessment that it is improving police attitude towards the "hate crimes" could be carried out.
The "hate crimes" is in the American Federal law as a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was following the death of Martin Luther King's adopted in order to punish acts of violence against race, colour, religion or descent, and now also includes offences of sexual identity.

Austria
Registration of "Golden budget rule in the constitution
In Austria, the government in power groβen socialist/Christian Democrat coalition has decided on Tuesday, a "golden budget rule in the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and a possible degradation by rating agencies in the top-rated Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner, Mr Faymann very personally, this decision ends of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian national debt in 74.6%, i.e. far above the benchmark set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but significantly below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria in one fell swoop down from AAA to AA +, so we should each year to pay an additional three billion euro interest rates," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Auβenminister.
Austria is also a requirement of the Brussels summit of eurozone Member States on 26 October, the Heads of State and Government had at the time, including the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, and a return to the public accounts equal weight in the Constitution or by adopting a similar law.
In this respect from the Austrian government's Maβnahme resembles the "German model", because Germany was the first European country that such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By the year 2017 if the structural budget deficit every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state of the 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states as well as the communities are balanced budgets.
The aim is to the horizon of 2020/21, household debt under the set by the Maastricht treaty 60% criterion.
A strong yen
Noda with a new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, on Tuesday warned that the Japanese power again would intervene in the currency markets, if the yen continues to rise.
"We should excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen," said, we will intervene, as well as we did the last time, "said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen, in turn, close to the historic levels aufgeschnellt, the Japanese authorities on 31 October had forced the intervention.
To this day, Tokyo sold $massive yen against the Japanese currency value, which is a new record level since 1945 hitting against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen about regelmäβig, use drugs through purchases of investors, the yen as "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen by 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels have found that the last intervention getriggert.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009 listed 120 yen to the dollar, the euro more than 160 yen.
This flash in Japan's motto is damaging to the exports of the archipelago, because the cost of "Made in Japan" products more expensive and reduces the Japanese firms income drawn from abroad, since they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11, the region devastated Tohoku (North East), for its reconstruction," said M. Noda, the fears that the rise of the yen in the weak recovery could kill the germs.
The third economic world power, with growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared with the previous Quartal for the first time this year, thanks to the erratic export increases and consumption of the disaster "plombierten 'budgets again gained traction.
The Prime Minister is estimated, however, that the rise of the yen is not "the economic foundations of Japan" reflects.
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi has, for its part, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), a two-day meeting on Tuesday opened its monetary policy committee, urged to take all possible Maβnahmen, in order to weaken the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has, however, informed, the BOJ said "appropriate Maβnahmen", which he liess reported that on Wednesday not to expect additional monetary easing.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Fed had their sovereign bond purchases at 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to cover amounts to wipe it for various purchases of securities had spent the liquidity to flood the market.
Eurozone:
Zinsfüsse are skyrocketing, stock markets are back
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis consistently undermined the European indices.
Despite the official opening of the new government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany will increase the rates of Länders steadily weakened further.
The stock market, which is still about the stability of the euro zone are concerned, to drive this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more in negative pastures.

This revival of concern about the future of the euro the single currency, which damages their Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro is for one and a half months to its lowest level.
About 10 p.m. the European currency 1,3570 dollar which was worth it was therefore by 0.4%.
According to the Börsenmaklern is they fell after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered on Monday in Congress, a request had, in particular the possibility for troubled countries, to withdraw from the euro zone, without at the same time to leave the European Union.

The loan rates of Italy and Spain are still very beunruhigendem levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds 6.85%, the Spanish title fruit to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continues to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for by the markets more time to the paralysis of the debt burden to restore endangered situation in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, had confirmed the implementation on 27 October at the summit of eurozone decisions are "the main task" of his government.

Germany had, over the same period, a growth of 0.5%.
An initial projection of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission against the risk of a new recession warns.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that is not on the basis of short-term considerations or cannot be treated as a result of emotions, so this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect Maβe purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable, a choice for a reason to take on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational fundieren data.
Although 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, is not a very large share of the world's population at a crucial element.
At the same time you have to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to be able to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from the environmental debate verschwundenes subject to forget to fight against climate Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision on nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which his decision the need, a substitution capable replacement source, even in Switzerland, which barely intends to only nuclear power plants in the past generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few states, but their projects continue to pursue with determination.
The United States has decided, after Fukushima, their parking another unit, confirmed by the nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island plant deactivated again.
Even if it focused on renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes portrayed as a model, but the reality is the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, due to the increased use of Importgas enhanced energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in the gas and coal-fired power stations-induced CO2 emissions.
All of this unpleasant effects are already being felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is one European tables leader in wind energy, from the 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, in turn used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 Ausstösse and each of its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy has a key role of competitiveness and a stability deposit the industry on national soil, the French companies because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in energy prices, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to be illusion liesse.
Polls showed that the price is the very broad majority of French nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us that energy policy of our country has made it possible for an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 inferred jobs.
Because of its strong export nature makes it a host of specialized small and medium-sized companies on the international markets and makes them to creators of jobs.
France should the decision to get out of nuclear power, which a Groβteil fall victim to this small, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more together.
The electricians would work at the sixty years designed EPR, if the decline of its producers is inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation we must acknowledge that it just as a devil a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
The company Areva advanced, low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible level of security to maintain for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams who made a name for their professionalism, from the safety position just obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry three serious incidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, is under normal operating conditions; he was without consequences for people and the environment.
It was the tragedy of Chernobyl reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters caused unprecedented drawn, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will also draw lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperative security authorities of the French and German operator and designers of nuclear power plants, a draft of the EPR, his resilience to such phenomena.
Because it is seen as a desirable electric technicians, to build a nuclear power plant, there would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein liesse, the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development reissen itself.
It is essential and legitimate, after the best Energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate, as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country considerations.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised for a number of points, police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures that have undergone a policy of reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France itself was heading.
Recently, the anti-harassment of official foreign students look at the weekend, the Home Secretary had a passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France "no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad was necessary."
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.
The tone of right-wing side has been dented by Jacques Chirac, the 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country should be," from left-wing side by Michel Rocard, 1990, France "could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit
The fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumber was in 2005 on both the right and the left.
From both camps were immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent to which the Groβzügigkeit, the immigrants is willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to banalities, say, partnership development will allow it, our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem that could potentially have an impact on the election; but it is economically costly.
As the economy Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book, the latest findings on the immigration together (exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the experts about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limit immigration would weaken growth and the labour market situation.
Fears over the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these threats, the local workforce, particularly the less qualified, to be replaced by pressure exerted on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that the immigrants in reality much complementary than when the local wage workers, since they schwerpunktmäβig jobs in sectors that are technically unausgelastet job.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors, the local wage workers little comment, the better among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where the training is not the labour supply converged.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between natives and immigrants have a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni peri in this way has calculated that a 1% disabled rising flood of immigrants a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% only.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward the immigrants creation and economic growth is conducive (high proportion eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel laureates, Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Net migrants also contribute to the social systems, in European countries, for example, on average, for a total of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany einwandernde person the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of about 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start of his mandate, the lack of disciplinary issues "with the teeth."
They said teeth, which should deter immigrants, however, reached exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now, to consider the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate thing.
The European continent should remind themselves, who after its invention in Athens in front of more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, Holocaustes, the gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, Portugal and the Salazars Supreme in Greece had about themselves.
Some had probably believed it sufficient to exercise the right to vote in any way progressing democracy once and for all to see triumph over their enemies.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it is a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient, condition and can just as well to the "oppression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation that separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, we are in an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost political and democratic crisis.
The change of the Greek true-wrong-referendum would have insightful character in this regard had twice: Once the need for a strong return of policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of their inability to their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today have shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by the success of the national referendum, which, depending on the needs and perverse sequence was organised.
A free licence for the European single ruler or a leap into the void with nationalist withdrawal: A groβartige choice for the citizen.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clarified and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, moreover, no longer, where the list to an end - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which is the dictates of markets and rating agencies prevents that under his powerlessness and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and so that each of them connected nations.
The urgency is the popular sovereignty back the leadership of the European project.
As it is, on the whole, whether the Europeans to reduce its debt burden from the markets open and a future by investing forms.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition, which is not without complete democratic Rechtmäβigkeit can be taken without us quite sure to ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the socialists have been fighting for a long time, today every European economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind, that would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We need a new stage of European integration.
In France, the Republic to arise, it took the fact that Republicans to "create."
The revolution of interests alone was not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
On the economic front, we need a more integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to Europe.
"Contact" smart cards are unemployed audience
The world exhibition opens on Tuesday for smart cards in Villepinte Paris optimistic attitude to close their doors.
2011, according to the euro should really smart with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of Mikroprozessorchips (EC cards, SIM cards-phone), with more than 6 million units sold.
The tragendste segment is the contact unemployed technology, the payments on public transport or settling purchases, simply by the card to a reading device.
Compared to a year earlier this year sold 320 million should contact unemployed 460 million smart cards sold worldwide.
Its market share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million expected units) and about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of contactless payment to soil, after a long period of the Asia-Pacific region hinterhergehinkt.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment Terminals accept this.
In France, the more modest beginnings: Only 400,000 contact unemployed Visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore this year, 2.5 million contact unemployed passport Master Cards.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards.
"Two very broad French financial institutions have committed themselves to their customers in future bank cards systematically distribute kontaktlosem chip with peppers," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks tested payment via mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the road to the payment of future: The mobile phone.
A very small percentage of equipment has been with the implementation of these transactions necessary technology NFC (Near Field Communication).
"They are in default."
"But they should at least a real upward trend next year."
"We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, chairman of euro smart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Credit Agricole yesterday was the launch of a Testlaufes announced in delivery by December will take place until next June.

Terrorists front is clear, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram worried.
The long under suspicion of the relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβenminister Abdel Kader Messahel itself acknowledges that now in Algiers knowledge acquired. "
"The way in which the two organisations and the relationship of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he told not to go into more detail.
Paris seems a similar analysis.
The investigation on the last January kidnap of two Frenchmen in Niger have interfaces to light.
In a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of Aqmi kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory are the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces have been getöten.
French and Nigerian investigators want in the rubble at the site several phone chips, the terrorists.
Terrorists axis
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria are stationed.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators interested in particular, the numbers of two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram had stopped; the other leads to a man who, as the Aqmi and close to the sect.
"This is a step forward, however, we must undoubtedly await clearer evidence before an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem can speak."
"But it is possible."
"You know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support Auβen and that this has become increasingly active shows," to ameliorate the Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo.
In these last few months if they were "assistance" in its course has become ever more obvious, as well as the speeches and the Operationsmodi of Boko Harem that are now on the drag of suicide bombers and the use of always complexity of explosives suggest that bear the same mark as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to begin in Washington, has since that time pressure on Abuja to be there for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, the group for a long time as a community of Illuminaten considers that does not need special attention.
Rapid success
In 2002, in the vicinity of a mosque in Maiduguri, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf founded in Haoussa Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a disgrace" - is following the establishment of an Islamic Emirats in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the association of rapid successes.
It is politicised and strict adherence to Sharia law, while their connected activists in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities in their sights.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram, with its increased attacks against the Kommissariate particularly active.
The response from Abuja, however, indifferenziert as usual.
The army surrounded the city, it has 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf received in captivity will be killed in prison.
As a result, the sect increasingly radical and out of their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, they are known to attack in Jos, the 80 deaths, then to another in Abuja.

The world gemäβ of Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and lack of knowledge about China, Iraq and support for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America a complex world with simple, not to say: Stupid ideas?
If the Republican presidential candidate is listening to the voters could almost get the impression.
For several days I Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters their thundering declarations and statements regarding the Auβenpolitik, traditional republikanischem focus, consistently reported.
On China, Iran and the Israel-aid - often fall-in any way - slogans.
The terms of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" in the course of the highest possible Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to quote from the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia at Äuβerste prickly - to accuse.
Gone stupid, if this is the introduction of a trade war would imply, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and one candidate, a mature vision of Auβenpolitik seems to have had nearly the emotions about his performance, the strangled schmeichelnden.
He had a solid, but constructive talks with Beijing exchange (also called the current position Obama's).
But Huntsman will not be heard, because he was in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also had praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to Stoppung of the nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I leads to Iran," he had getönt.
"Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
Auβerdem he has promised to increase military aid to Israel and Obama accused this partner has to commitments.
The businessman Herman Cain, second-highest platzierter candidate, for its part, is a shameful acts ignorance.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat against, as Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear power" and appeared in eight auβer the fact that China has since 1964 in possession of nuclear weapons.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry Israel supports and military strikes against Iran, for its part, äuβert, agree to the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
Obama's 2009 forbade using Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also of Cain, Perry and Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen emphasis.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan was also simple ideas and in spite of the Cold War.
They pointed out that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine had to pay, on the issue of anti-terror.
She is right to insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which is also the name of weakness.
These Anfeindung, however, is not quite so freely.
The population estimates more positive assessment of the National Security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq Upholds before military intervention, which lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised adequate, he argues that America needs to be rebuilt in its leadership position to rekindle.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly with Russia, has been in operation.
It is gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted this event with pomp and circumstance.
More than 500 directors, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, Russia and Germany below sea level.
The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic way along the tax of Ventils turned what the Russian gas to Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres per year extra Russian gas through a pipeline of 1,224 km from the region of Saint Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, supplied to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which is a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption -, is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And it is already the possibility of building a third transmission route referred to themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion point this enormous Bauwerkes as a victory.
The project was in Poland and the Baltic States highly controversial.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any links course by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) across the continent.
For this reason, these two countries will lose some of their power: It is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia, by threatening to access to Western European markets to close down.
Warsaw, most in the debate, has not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new Franco-German and tables pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst.
Western Europe has the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
But at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has finished in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong Gasverbrauche and their gas reserves are becoming exhausted.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects to organic way," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the groβen Gasverträge by political and economic side are important.
All of this explains the broad smile of Lubmin number of Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete shelter, which is intended to protect them from Schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed, in approximately 200 metres depth.
In its construction from the Second World War had previous minefields be avoided.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
Auβerdem Maβnahmen had increased to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: Either through valves or maintenance stations.
A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have held back from since the Swedes were not keen, a Russian state company on permanent way to match its coasts located.
"In the event of an accident close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.
Hole in the event of a leak in the pipeline owned gas in the air.
In this case, however, the designers probably regarded as little as Schweiβnähte on a consistency of a leak was estimated per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline, both from a submarine robots, the external surveillance purposes from being driven by a place, as well as from a device which circulates within the pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced in the interior of the pipeline and the gas pressure continued.
After three full days of moving through the pipeline at a speed of 3 metres per second, the device in his arrival provides detailed information on possible deformations of metal.
The pipeline was designed for fifty years, without the slightest undergo repairs.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This is 200 cash to the Zutritts, 100 cash to the exit point.
Five companies have their forces on the implementation of this project.
The leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, the 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. on and BASF (ever attached to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez (ever to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, and with the construction and operation of the pipeline is commissioned.
It is located in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
The company Gazprom, then the entire capacity of their Gastransportes hired out on renewable Twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how groβ Gasmenge from transporting the real one," clarified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The entire labour costs should be to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are gewiβ to recoup its expenses, because Gazprom alone the liability risk.
The pipeline is on a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of gas before arriving in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies verstreichende per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark note book.
By an Italian company about 15 years old, Moleskine now the letter back new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candles licence with the letter came hours.
The note book by Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rechteckigen cover, his rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen sides, such as the time out aged.
The Moleskine note book, as it is known today, however, in 1997.
The Italian company falls falls, which has its headquarters in Milan, at the time a distinguiertes design note book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist adviser of the company, with the market introduction of the new product.
The note was from an old book production technology, called wharf start (mole skin), which described a Baumwollack, for example for salaries of cushion benches.
This type of note book was among writers and travellers would be much appreciated.
"Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject to revive, until the 20th century avantgardistischer artist was seen as an icon," explained Maria Sebregondi, responsible for the whole brand now falls.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and establish a sales of 12.7 million deal.
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine happens the Italian border and will be carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyer, since the notice book, business people and students and professionals.
Moleskine has more cosmopolitan image, cultured and open intellectual customers.
The small Italian company that is in its infancy 12 staff, now employs more than 100 employees and has since 2008 on two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, Internet portals such as Fnac, small Boutiquen of city centres and is understood to assert its identity.
"We are the spirit and his new Schreibbedarf followed, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait which will accompany the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand an exposure called "Detour (indirectly)", the architects and artists have their own notebooks issue.
In August, the company at the Locarno film festival also cover with leopard pattern on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit, and then to diversify its products: Pockets, diary, pen, computer remain... The brand, the whole range of articles.
A success, Neider on the plan: In the autumn of 2006, there was the whole of investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital bought, and suggested a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people to find a job.
Today, "the 15th week of work for the disabled."
Despite a determined public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice the average middle value: Arbeitlosigkeit 19% to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric said Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled "liberal."
"The progress made within 15 years."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to do."
It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed still many obstacles remain before they get a job.
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 disabled under the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult for a new work a rose, and the "heart of the problem is," Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The underlying implication, the spirit of attitudes, certainly, but slow to develop.
One in April by the Association of IMS-entreprendre et for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have "a weak knowledge levels on the disabled," the "over-represented" was "of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off."
Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which enshrined in an Act of 1987,.
The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.
"We are now in the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is charged with recovering contributions from companies that violate the law.
The evidence: The number "fees zahlender" plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and from 59,000 zahlenmäβig at 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros).
"This Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real insight, especially the groβen firms groups."
According to the Department for Work employ only 59% of establishments between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky '
Even before the "blue Dienstagabenden (20:45 p.m.) stand, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had their pleasure that brought them the friendship game, not hidden.
It would be too wide-ranging to claim that there had been a covert agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the Bystanders podium of the Stade de France had George Leekens scenes and Eden Hazard well peace can close down.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his offensive player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had nothing but praise for his person harvested.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgians."
"I would like to look forward," assured the native Liller itself.
With regard to the contrast between his presentation in club and Nationalelf is concerned, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It is time for me to go to the start."
Hazard after Saint-Denis, come Friday night against Romania in terms of Matchs against France, at last, "to shine."
But without the note of the "pleasure".
The French national team he fires since the age of 7 years, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will inevitably result in the "extraordinary" nature of this meeting more.
So much in advance, "Mathieu Debuchy (a), Yohan Cabaye, Adil Rami will be there," he quoted.
"We just went through."
"To be able to play against them means groβes luck!"
For its part, with good humour Leekens liess "pride" implies.
"The pride, a Galamatch".
"Pride" and, in his capacity as "neighbours" - to confirm that France "another team has come at a very high level," and a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Condemns Laurent Blanc has done a good job," he said.
Although Belgium in the next European Cup is lacking, the technicians worked very well the plane with the blue (the French Nationalelf) share... and Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians groβ come out," he said.
"We are in the process of a business plan, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will say that in the forthcoming games." The game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento groβem optimism, with the return leg against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had the Hinspiel the serenity.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we are a good team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible for September 2010 to qualify for the Euro 2012.
For Portugal, this means, in fact, only 90 minutes to be happy.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent abzuservieren, Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that has not yet been decided.
Portugal for more than an hour dominated the game, but the team has not been able to mark on the important thing, she would have taken the pressure.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, since we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright erstrahlenden Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese convinced, before an audience that just heiβ on the game, for, even if the game, of course, as "very close" was announced, said the optimistic, but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but are completely convinced, be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of Euro 2012 to be present," however, watered down the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese, a gateway to achieve and to win.
A draw the Bosnians, who is also need a goal already.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, since we have made no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they have no time to think admit." "
A good idea, provided that this time it will be put into practice.
