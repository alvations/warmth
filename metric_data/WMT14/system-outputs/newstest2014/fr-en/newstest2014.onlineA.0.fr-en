The NSA case underlines the absence of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the french government, which on one hand is offended in public by summoning the Ambassador of the United States on October 21, and the other prohibits the overflight by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on Board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response on the part of the french government.
When François Holland phone Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summoned the Ambassador of the United States, they respond to a real discovery, which is the scale of U.S. surveillance on all the papers in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the world a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA listens?
Is there not as a wave hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but research interest and the relevance of information that enables every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks uncovers the analysis of politics or other American diplomacy around the world, we consider in fact that, at the sight of American power, this constitutes important insight.
When we describe U.S. interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, is certainly not for us indignant by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has the France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed our interests?
Can we deprive American collaboration?
The establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools to intercept very powerful by the United States, but the France also, officially was justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, the France and the United States in particular were set up almost daily cooperation and information exchange procedures and which are described on part and other as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in Miranshah tribal areas were reported to the French through the NSA.
The France can be conducted, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the region of the Sahel to U.S. services, and in return - already quickly said-, Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world.
So the background behind this NSA case question is not so much the ability or the right of countries to develop tools for interception, that the issue of the absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the rationale for such systems, the perimeter which must be their own, and, ultimately, the issue of the attacks on freedoms.
That could really US? a deterioration of their image?
It was nice to denounce them, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk run by Americans may be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the peak of their State, have been monitored.
This is the case of the Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European companies or South American Balk, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. service providers subject to U.S. law, and thus to the right-of-way of the NSA.
Last item: the extensive revelations move initiated by media around the world, helping to initiate a debate on the monitoring practices intelligence until then virtually non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers that they have given to their intelligence services.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in full outbreak of violence
The American president was to receive Friday, November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
The Iraq has known in October its deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures published Friday, November 1st by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations gives a higher with 979 deaths and 1 902 injured same balance.
Such violence are more lethal despite measures enhanced security and large-scale military operations launched by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, the Shia-dominated for months.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
Two years after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, the level of violence made fear a new conflagration while the neighboring Syria is embroiled in a civil war.
The bombs struck markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street, or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The discontent of the Sunni minority, to the power under Saddam Hussein, who complained of be marginalised politically and be the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this outbreak of violence.
Friday, new violence killed four people in the North of the Iraq, in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of bombings, including the explosion of five car bombs North of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Iraq Islamic State and to the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a 'global war' against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the center of talks in the United States by the Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, who will be received Friday by president Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end the military involvement in that country, had pitched an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki stepped up meetings with the Executive, and the members of Congress.
Thursday, he argued that the international community leads a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased assistance to the Iraq security is supported by influential Republican and Democrat senators.
But they have also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by its "authoritarian and sectarian policy".
They also demanded by Barack Obama to understand to Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
The French police stop supporters of Anderlecht came otherwise with busloads of RSCA
The French police decided to pose strict rules regarding the meeting of Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht against Paris Saint Germain set Tuesday, contacted Marie Verbeke, the spokesman of the police zone Bruxelles-midi, Friday.
RSCA Belgian fans who wish to attend this meeting of the Champions League must use the movement set up by RSCA.
"The convoy of buses will be escorted by police from a former border post of Rekem to PSG stage", transmitted the spokesman.

The Vatican probe on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat the men and women who live together without being United by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October at each national conference of the bishops, with the setpoint to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used in a major rally on the family that Pope François provides organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each Bishop would decide how to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops have published Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
37-year-old man who took a child hostage at École Gabrielle Roy of Surrey faces six counts, according to the RCMP of the Canada.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, uttering threats, port of weapon for a purpose dangerous, removal, and failure to comply with an order.
"The quick reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to diffuse the situation immediately have been essential to the safe conclusion of the incident," said corporal Bert Paquet by way of press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court Friday.
The new nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that one takes to smoke a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect lives of mice of the nicotine addiction.
Other tests are necessary before testing on humans, but the Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies selectively.
Antibodies stalk all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have his dose of nicotine.
When tested, vaccinated mice which were given then the nicotine continued their activity normally.
But said them mice that had not been vaccinated were "eased", the researchers, sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections must be repeated if frequently for that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and few practices.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms into factories to antibody liver cells.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, could administer to children until they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They know that if they begin to smoke, they will take no pleasure because the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this may help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
Islamists Egyptians in the streets to denounce the trial of Morsi
Anger is booming in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of the ousted president Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the reinstatement of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlines this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer was able to meet him and no volunteer was able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
This is not a trial, this is a farce.
The trial of the president Morsi is a mock trial railed a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the contrary.
Morsi must judge Sisi for Lili, the massacres of Nahda, massacres and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, the police made use of tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the police academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities have announced October 31 that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin so that France is free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found October 25 to Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological inquiry has been initiated to identify and support the people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 included," said the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people who had been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of rabies human, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," said the press release.
Departments now call people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched or licked on mucous membranes or skin injured by this kitten or where the animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1.
"The France being free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother were imported from another country, not free", according to the release.
The Ministry of Agriculture said that the last identified "indigenous" rage case dates back to December 1998 on a Fox and that "the France is declared officially free of the disease in November 2001 by the Office international des epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog imported illegally Gambia had been registered in 2008.
"Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated in time," remind government departments and it is transferable for nearly 15 days before the appearance of the first symptoms of the disease.

An Australian appealed against his sentence of imprisonment in Thailand
A resident of Sydney of 21 years, sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment in Phuket to have wrongly claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the judgment and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford first was found guilty by a court in Province of Phuket on 15 June of misrepresentations after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who mastered it, had assaulted her early Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to his hotel safely after had separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interviewed Bamford two days before that she admits to having invented the story from scratch.
She was held in a cell of the local police station prior to the hearing before the tribunal.
Bamford was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a prison for women.
It is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the family was "extremely concerned" for the welfare of her daughter and wanted it returned to Australia.
"We have obviously experienced a scary moment, but we hope to bring it back home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the judgment and has been released after the payment of bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, South of the Thailand.

However, after the recent murder to Phuket from Michelle Smith, an officer of Australian trip, the Thailand could also seek to burnish its image worsened among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
Google, Samsung and Huawei make lawsuits relating to Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of old patents Nortel began an avalanche of lawsuits Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he has capped patent at the post during the auction of patents which took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for 4.5 Md$, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement the Court of Assizes of the United States in Texas.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow to display advertising in connection with Internet search terms, reported the findings of the trial, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to contact representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC, and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufactured phones running the Google Android operating system, which delivers a fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google has made an initial offer of 900 M$ for patents from Nortel.
Google has increased its offer on several occasions, to eventually offer 4.4 Md$.
After losing patent Nortel against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility amounting to 12.5 Md$, a market in part based on the library of Motorola patents.
"Although having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue in the course of the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate patents," reported the conclusions of the trial.
Rockstar claims damages more important against Google, because he claims that the Google patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former New Labour Minister - Joe Tripodi South Wales will be investigated by the anti-corruption of the State regulator.
Former Minister of NSW's South Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had interests hidden in three properties in the area controlled by the Government.
Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation to know if Mr. Obeid had put pressure on several Ministers of State to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid have two restaurants and a café, after they expire in August 2005, though it was tender.
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Under-Secretary-General Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the Government lobbied to make leases are subject to a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases on businesses from Circular Quay, which related to the Obeid approximately 2.5 M$ per year, have been renewed without that there is no bidding.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially favourable to public tenders.
But he denied having changed its policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, conceded Mr Tripodi, demanded a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of conversations presented at ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of M Obeid at the Ministry of fisheries.
"Does the subject debated during these telephone conversations was the development of the policy on commercial leases?", Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
'No,' replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, this was it.
In any case certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not to make a call with their mobile phone)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to play, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talking on their cell phone - under the new highly anticipated guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta told a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and rules concerning storage of devices to be in compliance.
The FAA said that it had already received plans of some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies which have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve a wider use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must switch off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to again them before the aircraft reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the Commander gives go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their cameras during the descent of the aircraft before landing and not turn back on until the aircraft is placed.
Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings, and roll on the ground, said the FAA.
Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi - Fi to higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, is said to be pleased by these changes.
"Once the new policy implemented safe - and we'll work closely with carriers for this - it will be beneficial to everyone", Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feel us like "room guards" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, Exchange emails and SMS messages or download data below 10,000 feet, said the Agency.
Passengers must put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the game online style Scrabble which played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled in large sound of a plane of American Airlines after refusing to turn off his camera while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier equipment such as laptops should always be stored because they could harm someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on Board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national transport on CBS News security expert, said that the phones were always regarded as presenting a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly cause interference with navigational instruments, but because we know from the FCC, they could disrupt the antennas of mobile phone if they are used on board", Rosenker said.
An industry Advisory Committee established by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the Government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA is strengthened in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D - MO., argued that there is no reason valid security for these bans.
The restrictions are also more difficult to implement because the use of the devices became ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to turn off their appliances, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronics in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when the passengers were carrying radios FM, the high-tech gadget then.
New airliners depend much more than previous generations of aircraft electrical systems, but they are also designed to withstand the electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi - Fi at altitudes of cruise for several years.
The aircraft modified to accommodate Wi - Fi systems are also resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners should permit a wider use of consumer electronics under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit transmissions radio power much lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimum transmissions when you turn a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who are pushing for a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment by passengers.
In 2011, the company commissioned an airliner's electronic book Kindle readers and did fly to see if there were problems, but there are none.
This inspired the members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA's mixed feelings as to whether if the use of the equipment is or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought that interference from appliances were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee have said that there are only anecdotal reports from drivers that indicate that devices can interfere with the aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee has recommended that the FAA allows the drivers to ask passengers to turn off their appliances during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them full arrangements sense for travelers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
The rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board for the time being remain in force in Australia
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their shelves and their smartphones during take-off and landing despite the gesture of the United States to relax regulations for electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that the passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during phases of flight critical provided that they are in "airplane" mode
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find painful to not be able to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers review decision which requires U.S. carriers to carry out important work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they did not intend in the immediate future to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it was considering the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
«CASA la has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment in aircraft ", she said.
The issue is legislation requiring operators of aircraft to ensure the maintenance of security at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA de plans to expand the use of its entertainment system on board using Wi - Fi technology, was open to a change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
"We would positively welcome a review of CASA which would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (of entertainment on board system using Wi - Fi technology) on our aircraft", said a spokesman.
Qantas said that it met at the moment the current rules.
"In accordance with our policy current, electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we don't intend in the immediate future to change that," she said.
The FAA decision applies to American Airlines.
However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate interference from electronic devices, radio and review manuals, training materials, transportation of carry-on baggage program and the instructions provided to passengers.
"Once an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use Lightweight portable electronic devices, such as shelves, readers of electronic books and smartphones at all altitudes", said the FAA.
In the rare case of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their cameras during the landing.
The Group also recommended that heavier appliances are stowed safely under the seats or in the upper compartments during takeoff and landing.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children at schools
Wednesday, the US Centre of disease prevention and control issued a set of guidelines indicating how to manage food allergies of children at the school.
It is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. Government publishes, since the number of school age children with food allergies has strongly increased.
One child in 20 in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
CDC discovered that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff to allergies in children, and on how to treat them in the case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine - mark injector EpiPen being most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in the event of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of the States have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have easier epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I have the impression that something bites me language", "I have the impression of having a hair on the language" or "I have tingling on the tongue.
Much opposition to medical help to die at the Congress of palliative care
The Canadian Congress of palliative care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for many palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to staying at home, very few of them would put an end to their days, according to a spokesman of the Canadian palliative care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we put emphasis on palliative care in the Canada, the approach of euthanasia would become minimal.
The President of the network of palliative care in Quebec also rejected the Bill on medical assistance to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry worries of the consequences on future generations.
"What is the meaning of life", deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes refuse to help patients to die, according to the Vice-Chairman of the Alliance of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also Director of la maison Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, considers that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked: "I want to die, give me an injection".
The Director of the Association of palliative care of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec Bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario follow the steps.
For its part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of end of life should be clarified before the Bill is passed.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed later and us dress up to go in the vicinity.
Today, I have become more stingy.
These past two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I won't definitely more this year.
But the stats show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them actually - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 Md$ candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party, are trends.
The fancy dress should represent 1.2 Md$ on the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professional; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
With regard to men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk space men will be among our Instagram pics this year.
According to Google, the most popular fancy dress are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it did not hurt to remain traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year, and to my amazement, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend 330 M$ in fancy dress for animals this year, according to the NRF.
It made a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, it does nil.
The Americans will spend 1.9 Md$ candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and bars Clark.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go to the candy hunt in their vicinity, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and do we tell no stories, consuming 41 million kg of chocolate for Halloween.
Candy corn are the only thing we do not want to eat; and yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet arrived to elucidate.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween as the haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, generating approximately 500 M$ of revenues, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these great pictures of piss you being you on it that your friends are on Facebook and you can not remove and on which a type that you like leave a comment of "lovely head" style
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown presented us the big pumpkin when we were kids, and carve a pumpkin Lantern-shaped, it's like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something that is since it is very small.
Fortunately for us, the 'pumpkin baby trend"began that year last thanks to Pinterest, so most of us has carved these pumpkins and did not have to sit in.
This year, Americans will spend approximately 106 M$ in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Pumpkins-lanterns which wilt gently on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million Pumpkins have grown this year.
If you are looking to get out more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
Transport of schoolboy: deemed admissible complaint
The Commission scolaire de la région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires since the beginning of the school year's fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transportation to two residences, a service offered by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before changes are made in the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," says Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and it sought additional time to think.
"It is always better to talk, work together and find solutions," believes Ms. Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) would not comment.

DRC: Army attack the last stronghold of the rebels
The irreducible m23, or a few hundred fighters, were cut off to nearly 2000 metres above sea level on the hills agricultural Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night, told AFP a resident of Jomba, contacted by telephone around 12:30, and that a girl was injured by bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit", he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC a little repulsed rebels".
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before mounting to the front for a "sweep operation".
Meant very much behind the crackling fed arms.
Bunagana, political stronghold and last stronghold of the dark rebellion Wednesday, an AFP correspondent could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source in the UN Mission for the stabilization of the DRC, fighting came "in a final phase," FARDC having "encircled the residual the M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the takeover, Friday, clashes between the movement of March 23 (M23) and the army, Monusco is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides to government troops decisive support intelligence, observation and planning.
Late in the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, rode in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana border post with Uganda, soldiers helped civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a truck brand new FARDC, to ensure succession of another engine pounding the positions of the M23 in the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called Wednesday night once again the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" otherwise be disarmed "by force", but left open the process of Kampala, Kinshasa and the M23 discussing since December without result so far.
On-site, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We ended the talks, it remains more than Ugandan mediation to arrange the signing," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-Chairman of the delegation of the M23, unless this information can be confirmed immediately by the Government side.
The M23 was born of a revolt, April 2012, former rebels, mainly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa accusing regularly Uganda and Rwanda support the M23, that refute Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, along the Ugandan border, where about 5,000 people between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, had taken refuge movement back to the DRC which was switched on in the morning was reversed at midday.
"This morning we were back in our fields, but the military said us fold", told the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including an infant on his back.
One has the impression that the shots are close populations.
In early evening, dozens of people crossing the border, some with a mattress on his head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The Israeli army killed a member of Hamas in Gaza-SAP
Israeli tank fire killed Thursday a militant Palestinian Islamist Hamas and seriously wounded another in the South of the Gaza Strip, has been learned after sources of health services.
A source from Hamas said that fighting erupted in this region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were referred by your shots by Palestinian mortars.
The army Israeli is is merely to evoke a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the State Hebrew, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced mid October.
The concern with security in Mozambique grows as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founder and president of Mozambique, process of gawking, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo for peaceful chant during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; We want stability,"said Vanessa de Sousa, General Manager of an investment company.
Worried for the future of her country, she has exchanged his work clothes against a t-shirt bearing the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd amassed on the place of the independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between Government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement which was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a rebel movement famous, supported initially by the Rhodesia ruled by white then the Government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent Government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it has become an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are considerable for the economy growing since the discovery of huge reserves of deposits of coal in the Northwest and offshore gas could attract more than 50 Md$ investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of the Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo will mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says that the Government is behind recent clashes and that it has launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when Government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, spokesman of Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government makes the Renamo responsible for triggering conflict and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza said Wednesday to AFP, the French news agency, Mr. Dhlakama himself as a "loser" who wanted to use all the forces that he had to attempt to prove that he could impose its decisions to the Government.
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they wish to both avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT he meant that the agreement was more respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume the negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to reduce tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop to argue," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer of the University open and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows well negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that she boycotterait the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are planned next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a movement ill to obtain concessions and a treasure trove of war on the part of the Government.
The share of the votes collected by the Renamo keeps decreasing since 1992, while a new party, the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, should get a lot of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - which ought to withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the Presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We know exactly what is the capacity of the Renamo, but it carried out disruptive Flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South motorway route.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port where the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, exporting coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after that Renamo has threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo réitèreraient this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not well in Mozambique", said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustration aroused by the Government, said Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the future of the country are the Government and the president, and that is to find solutions to the problems," he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people wanted only to stability.
«Nobody cares Renamo or Frelimo, they want just to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads, he added.
PIA: at least four injured in a violent Brawl
The small town of Pia has experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three police vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people reportedly collected...
In this day of Halloween, the evening was choppy side Pia where a brawl involving several people broke out on the side of the post.
Four minor injuries at least would be regrettable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went on-site to separate the warring parties and ensure that the wounded are supported.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who looked young, in the region of Halifax, Nova Scotia, is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and in the office of the national Council of research where he worked.
Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor officiated, said that he was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, the leaders of the church indicate that Dr. Hudgins has resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
It must not communicate with persons less than 18 years and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax, in December.
Coulson has used the phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "the phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a phony pipe on a route involving the Minister of the Interior then in office, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said the Court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his 'pretty special adviser.
It was reported to the Court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, hack Pawlby voicemail box and "plant permanently outside her door", but Coulson also called her and left him voice messages.
«The charge suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor-in-Chief of NotW, isn't the kind of man to remain in the House of the people hoping to surprise them, this is the kind of man to love to tell the story to people to see what they say», said Mr Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: the phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The Chief Editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that it is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what is the first?
There knowledge of the phone hacking?
It says otherwise, but we say 'of course that if.
Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were taken over first by the NotW editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction towards Miss Pawlby, stated that he had been told: "don't waste your time with it, it is with Charles.
A band, on which were recorded voice messages hacked on his phone on at least three occasions, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective who were Miss Pawlby and his sister arranged in a folder "projects".
During the period where the detective has investigated it, Miss Pawlby grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information on it, said Mr Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised monitoring of every fact and Miss Pawlby gestures.
In a voicemail that he left on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr Edis said that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while himself attended the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted having carried out the phone hacking.
Bailout of 325 M$ for the system of health of Tasmania
The federal Government maintains that bailout of 325 M$ for health system wobbling is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the State Government will not waste the funds.
The Federal Minister of health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island State, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding over 4 years, decided after consultations of the Government with the independent MP for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which we will solve the unique challenges faced by the State", said Ms. Plibersek today.
The plan of 325 M$ includes a campaign of 31 M$ for non-urgent surgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funds are also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care and the medical training, services dedicated to mental health and deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments meet the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, it's the best way to treat the Tasmania health system", said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister said that the Tasmanian Government would be faced with a strict regime for the preparation of reports and accountability.
The State shall maintain current funding levels to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends additional funds.
A commission composed of three persons will be incorporated to ensure that the State provides services more efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that 325 M$ will not count for much "unless they are followed by a genuine reform to strengthen the public health system in Tasmania.
It nevertheless commended the Government for responding to the urgent aid application submitted to the Prime Minister early May.
"I hope that federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system of Tasmania from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional elective procedures reverse largely the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton think that today's announcement is a "a quick fix.
"The reason we are here is that the Labour Government in the State has withdrawn 430 M$ of its health system", he said on ABC TV.
It is impossible to have a Government of the State which puller almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth which puts 300 M$, and pretend it's an auspicious day.
Mr. Dutton made visit to Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of bailout will be spent in bureaucracy.
He walks in the mud, the jungle and crossed rivers to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all of their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN hero of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for it 'Heroes CNN of the year'.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visiting hospitals that were not equipped for him come help.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
Initially, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would bear the consequences the rest of his life.
"There are no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father in clinics and hospitals crowded, so he gets any treatment which he could benefit.
"This is not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the House at 5 o'clock, rush you to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is to 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians couldn't pay the consultation.
Two people out of five in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health spending are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have practiced more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year.
He became doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a humanitarian association non-profit, ASCOVIME, who goes to rural areas during the weekends for free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they are crammed into vans after attaching the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get in the villages who most need help.
The chance do not always follow them.
They repeatedly had to push the vehicle to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: the community organizes a celebration, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with her big smile and his energetic - is more than happy to join in the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We get 500 people at each visit", said Mr. Bwelle.
They live sometimes to 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate - document needed to go to school, but many poor families cannot simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practice simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally performed in a school, a town hall or a House; After the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave his room for the next person.
Through the generator lighting, operating room and the sterilization of equipment, Dr. Bwelle and its volunteers are working until the early hours Sunday morning.
It is a grueling pace, but musicians from the villages help in general the team to stay motivated.
"They knock on drums all night to keep awake to us so that we can continue to work", explained Mr Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practised 700 surgical free during last year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they are helping.
A man explained that the operation free that he had suffered to treat a hernia would allow it to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to live this roving hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private around Yaoundé medical practices.
It is this second job, he explains, which funds 60% its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I do not know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Group of Dr. Bwelle.
It is still in the hospital or trying to find money for its association in order to carry out these campaigns.
This is an opportunity for medical students and nursing students as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, learning on the ground that they do not have at home.
"It could participate in operations to help absorb blood or pass instruments to Dr. Bwelle," explained Miss O'Malley.
This is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you're a medical student in the second year.
Student volunteers pay in general their trip to Cameroon, and often come with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, their transportation and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly shut down.
For Dr. Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a fix.
Help others live happily taking the promise he made to his father is something that brings him an immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons which lead me to do this.

Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The Interior has bucket seats and belts 6 point harness, as well as an Intercom System.
Among the options, include improved brakes, a service giving access to the Bowler Works engineers, logistics and storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Bowler Motorsport Director-general said: "rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallies to the United Kingdom and abroad, and to prepare the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun to develop the vehicle for Defender Challenge - the Championship is really going to be exciting. »
In addition, Defender Challenge will feature a day of training and tests in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa.
The two France's Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but pointing out his weakness for the roads, Sciences-Po, des Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office of Gaston Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the Publisher.
Heir of the Chair held Fontenelle to the Académie française?
Still, but knowing that a such sacred cannot replace the real holy oil, one of the thesis, which has happened.
They readily recognized in him a great awakener, host and unifier of their work, but noting that he was reluctant to produce itself.
This uncertain image the monument of "Places of memory", to which he attached his name, has also contributed.
Nasty languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by a commentator intelligent, with a bright look and leste scholarship, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora here soon two years have already established that one who passed for not writing were many and well written.
The book that here should definitively justice it.
There are yet once more, the temptation to Ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation jump as at attached feet from one topic to another.
But one understands quickly of disparate objects collected in this book to the so beautiful title bringing the Junkman with a single passion: to discover the constituent node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: this is a concern of time.
Here are few, we have collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the assertive spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It should deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
That stalking Pierre Nora is quite different.
It does not arise in an eternal Francité heir, he refuses to the definition.
Analyst worried a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at each step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented irritating questions.
Whose thereof, that arises from the enterprise itself: why, in a country if permanently installed in its borders, if formerly structured and securely masoned, meant these dramatic appeals for unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to stave off disorder born of the discord of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and protestants: the forces of division, here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously one that splits into two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two types of nations, monarchical and the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but to deny; concerned instead to find the sacredness and even more Avid unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head to that which was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And then a nation immediately binary, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make feel this singularity of French identity, nothing beats the four not out of France, so Pierre Nora American getaway could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and the France have one and one makes a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousin does that better highlight what we own.
There, men who had left their old Regime in England and had more to worry about.
Here, men crowded an Ancien Régime native and even more radical.
There a revolution consensual when here she planted the drama and confit.
There always honored founders, and here the revolutionary ancestors which we barely do models, and that the rest ourselves.
There an institutional stability, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many errors to catch up and testing to resume.
The France that goes, the France that comes
Yet there was a time where the French have believed she could sew up the dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the two sales.
This third Republic, while central and creator, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, by teaching students what in the former France preparing darkly modern France and offering them a version unified in their history.
But this peaceful identity has had a time.
Here it is again in debate, shoved by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of the France that goes and cautious sketch of the France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We discover that the Zain was a homebody.
Man of multiple sights revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The Prowler's edges stood in the center of downtown.
And one who had filed here over half a century, a topic on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, says, cum grano salis, that it will eventually make it.
Certainly a less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But let us not misunderstand just as binding.
Because rather than imposed figure of the University curriculum, this thesis above says the inner need of a life.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Finished passwords to type to access its smartphone or pay purchases?
American, french and Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy CEO of Morpho, considers even that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe also transverse and transnational than the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but are worried.
Alone in 2011 and in France, the National Commission of computing and freedoms allowed 774 systems of recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or venous network of the hand in businesses, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone can soon be identified anywhere and anytime," has moved Justin Brookman, responsible for the privacy of consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will rely on new techniques, which will help make new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the Palm or the fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work the concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," notes Philippe Robin, technical director at Thales Communications &amp; Security identity.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume something voluntary and specific people.
This is both a security - cannot capture these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
Therefore, searches are conducted since twenty years on other approaches, such as recognition of the face or the iris (the colored eye part).
Thanks to the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and calculation capacity of computers for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of face recognition has multiplied tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of the laboratories of R & D of Accenture in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed with automatic border using face recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris on the move.
"Today, we are conducting research on the recognition of the voice or how to walk using sound sensors, but need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of research on safety at Intel Labs.
Unique and tamperproof, the DNA marker also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of studies, innovation and foresight to the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and costly.
NEC offers to the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples on the place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (make sure that the person is that she claims to be).
The identification was so far the issuance of identity papers: we must confront biometric (fingerprint, picture, iris) with the information the State has on citizens already identified.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
"We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to pictures of the celebrities which circulate freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, loaded, at NEC France, business development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo a nobody who makes the tail in a store, follow his progress through the facial recognition and calculate waiting time.
Authentication was initially the physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening of a computer).
Are added, more recently, control of presence.
"A biometric time clock avoids the phenomenon of buddy that points to another", justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this action replaces the striking of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angouleme the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and retail brands: at the time of pay in store with his credit card, the client does not tape its code, but inserts his finger into a drive that scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If it is successful, the biometric readers may soon arrive at french merchants.
Clues to reassure users
There are three ways to make the seductive biometrics in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a client is thirty seconds less cash, it is significant," says the Director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer custom options.
And, finally, reassure, highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on one server; "the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which hangs when trying to move", enumerates Philippe Robin, Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Specialists in the protection of private life, they continue to worry about.
"The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: a blanket surveillance", predicted Andrew Patrick, Office of the Commissioner for the protection of privacy in the Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay luggage handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying the carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a bag in hand and $2 for a cup of coffee or a soda, although only in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the bobbin not open with them on the descent of the aircraft.
The new hand baggage charges concern bags stowed in the overhead compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will be always free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if passengers paid only once at the boarding gate.
The Frontier spokeswoman, Kate O'Malley has indicated that $100 were expected to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
"We do want to pay this price", she explained.
Airlines have begun to charge first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in the hand baggage stowed in the upper compartments, so there's often more space in these compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees would not really serve to collect money.
This is to impress upon the Frontier of most loyal customers that it becomes increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a boarding gate Frontier could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the site and the procedures for registration of Frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these costs before you get to the door.
Frontier carry-on baggage fees will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other costs, but the airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Good number of people on Wall Street consider the addition of charge of baggage as a sign that proved that the airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them have not touched at the expense of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied first luggage fees to hand three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant airline followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the supplement charge.
It felt, in a report by December 2011, that Spirit carry-on baggage fees were 50 M$ per year.
Sorensen, a former Executive of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate at the time where the passengers would find baggage charges unusual hand imposed by the company.
"I had never seen a my entire professional career as fluid boarding procedure," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers are mounted on Board at the speed of lightning".
Frontier is also as Spirit and applies charges $ 2 for a cup of coffee, tea, a soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the bobbin not open with them, and those who take coffee can be reused free of charge.
It will distribute still water free of charge.
US Airways has briefly attempted to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
The decision of Frontier to pay baggage fees when passengers do not directly purchase their ticket at the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay sellers to online travel as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of apply to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer half of miles of loyalty to customers who purchased their ticket through a travel agency online.
Wednesday, it reduces premiums by miles of 25% on a trip.
Thus, a trip Frontier 1 000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they directly purchase their ticket on the site of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal following in his hometown, Denver, but its activity shrinks and loses money.
Revenues fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity has decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to straighten the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are related to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs while more their tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs the move more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "everyone knows that, in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions. ''
Here, we have tried to see what was in other species.
He added that even in humans, dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and both hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how the dogs respond to disordered other dogs tail movements, the researchers tracked animals watching movies that featured other dogs.
They measured heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
We should surely not long before that we understand why their tails sometimes goes on one side and the other sometimes.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "we presented to dogs of the films which included other dogs - either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor - and we were able to tamper with the movement of the tail and to present it as more left or right. ''
When the animals saw a dog without expression stir the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they have spotted a tail deflect primarily left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate accelerated, and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not believe that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
He thinks rather that dogs know from experience the movements that they should or should not worry.
He added: "If you repeatedly meet other dogs and if you notice, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you react based on that experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the school of veterinary science of the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the canine species.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned the head to the left when they watched a dog aggressive and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in the Canada, stated: "dogs were more easily to a robot dog when his cock stirred to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxiety - the reverse of what is contained in the Italian study."
He said that the differences could come that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider films animals or robots as dogs dogs.
A study on how the dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, identified in different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be saved, we should surely not long before that we understand why their tails move sometimes on one side and the other sometimes.

Living together in french, the challenge of the commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys
To the commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 62% of students have one mother tongue other than the french.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff, to reflect on ways to better integrate students living on horseback between several cultures.
The School Board has unveiled its vision of "Living together in french".
The Organization Vision diversity walks for a year in schools to help students of all backgrounds to discover common benchmarks that are not confined to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our locations are benchmarks.
The biggest names of writers, artists, be they ethnic or that they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify with all this", explains Aïda Kamar, President of Vision diversity.
Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the commission scolaire.
"On the transmission, for example, what is Quebec culture, the sense of belonging, support to staff in the transformations that we live within the student clientele", enumerates.
The commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys has created a research centre that will give tools to professors who may also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American context Quebec.
"Different teaching strategies, how is that the real need", she says.
The research will focus on the inclusion every angle: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
Obama puts an end to listens to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama gave order to the National Security Agency (NSA) to terminate the listens that she practiced on the international monetary fund and the World Bank in the context of its intelligence activities, says a U.S. official Thursday.
This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to regain control in the case of eavesdropping by the NSA after the revelations made by the former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
It is the first time that is referred to the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the Agency of information since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned on the subject, an official of the US administration said: "The United States lead no electronic monitoring for the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington".
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify if such monitoring had been implemented in the past.
Another official, him, indicated that Barack Obama had given orders to cease such practices in the past weeks.
This statement has been given roughly at the same time as that ending the plays of the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but allowed their pursuit.
The commission introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a limit of five years for the conservation of this information.
European stock markets down to the mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges evolve down Friday at mid-session, burdened by some disappointing corporate news, while Wall Street is expected to increase.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the Federal Reserve could resolve its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation to 0.7% for the whole of the eurozone, the idea is spreading among the players in the market that the European Central Bank (ECB) may ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures suggest U.S. equities increased opening, after two consecutive sessions of decline.
Values, Renault (-4,63%) recorded the highest withdrawal of the CAC 40, leaded by the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday warning.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also posted results lower this morning and announced internally of a structure of defeasance ("bad bank") involving 38 billion pounds of the riskier assets.
Meanwhile, Vodafone (+ 2.45%) remains at the head of the increases of the EuroFirst300 in response to a press information wanting that AT &amp; T is studying a possible takeover.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the monetary policy of the ECB are underway, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The unique mandate of the ECB has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting next week.
We anticipate a strong potential of fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro continued its decline against the US currency and touched in a lower two week session at 1,3517 dollar.
These same conjectures support unlike the euro area bond market.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this State and handing broadly the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The classical singing for adolescents
Each time, it is the students who will be targeted, an initiative which had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five playlets imagined and interpreted by artists of the region, thumbnails with a strong dose of humour, it allows adolescents to tame the classical singing.
In addition to this show, the company of lyric art of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula which is now room fills the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in summer 2014, which gives the chance to artists in the region to show what they are capable.
In these activities was added lyrical aperitif benefit concert held last August, with the assistance of Marie-Ève Munger soprano coloratura.
It was a fundraising activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped non-profit organization to produce a balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears than an air of the bat.
Without precise figures, the president of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press yesterday, meeting in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite insecurity which is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future emerges well, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant support.
"Finances are afloat and hopefully last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step that we cross in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would say even beyond", said Executive Director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The Congolese army hunts down rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were chasing the rebels in the M23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears about to be beaten after being driven out of the towns of the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), he controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the uprising.
"We will continue the M23 and cornering it everywhere where it is hiding because it is criminals," told Reuters colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC.
We must not let them reorganize because they martyrisent the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
The M23 officials told evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political head of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way modify its demands in the peace talks.
These, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa Government and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that overlook Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 has emerged in 2012.
At their peak in November, insurgents have occupied Goma, capital of Nord-Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the Government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the most important in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and form a quick readiness brigade composed of South African soldiers, Malawian and Tanzanian.
Meanwhile, the General staff of the FARDC has been redesigned and the Army went on the offensive against the M23, which change the course of the war.
The rate of progression of government troops today is unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to an end," predicted one expert from Congolese Affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - this would be the first time that the Kinshasa Government manages to beat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the East of the DRC.
The UN experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it fiercely, to militarily support the M23, formed initially mutinous Congolese ex-servicemen.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited the Rwandan president Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military retaliation as a result of the shells fell in Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, residents of Bunagana have invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
"We have lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be someday released by the army," reflects an inhabitant of this border town in Uganda.
"We lived in terror (from the M23), we are traumatized," said this man.
John Kerry has admitted an unprecedented, that the American espionage «had gone too far inappropriately»
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States with regard to its assuming, monitoring programmes is unprecedented, that on several occasions, espionage "had gone too far in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on 'automatic pilot' when a series of incendiary revelations of the Edward Snowden informer about the NSA spying activities has emerged.
The leaks have developed the American Government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: "it is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the Government are aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, since the second world war and until the difficult of the cold war, then of course September 11. ''
He then became the first senior member of the Government of the United States to admit that the American espionage had crossed the line, but insisted on the fact that each rights had not been violated.
He said: "In some cases, it went too far from inappropriately."
And the President is committed to trying to clarify and make it clear to people it was now engaged in a careful review of these practices so that nobody feels cheated.
I assure you that innocent people will not abuse the process.
Mr. Kerry has insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are willing to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world who is determined to try to kill people, explode and addressed by Governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented aircraft from falling, buildings exploding and people being killed because we were able to take knowledge of the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to respond to concerns about alleged American espionage case and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight against terrorism with the United States, said Thursday the president of the Senate on European Affairs Subcommittee.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he spoke before members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of the anti-terrorist organizations due to the sense of frustration about the National Security Agency surveillance.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Senate, in an interview from Washington.
And I am going in Europe for to make them it clear that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some allies of the United States, however the Director of the Agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that the NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of State.
The Director of intelligence, James Clapper, a justified spying on allies indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice for both sides.
In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip for the Congress, which is expected to take place this year and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, but also to show "tough love".
He explained that the European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs that they apply themselves for years.
"We can modify our monitoring programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to espionage," said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to handle the resentment generated by American policies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States surveillance activities.

For the CEO of Titan, "the proposed purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge with a bang in January for the partial resumption of Goodyear of Amiens-North site promised closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the U.S. negative Titan, expresses, today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 account the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of productive recovery, had already announced, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the proposed purchase of the plant in January, you come back today.
You had said violent attacks and insults, in speaking of "so-called workers", "working three hours" per day, unions "crazy", for the CGT.
It does not include this about-face.
Is - to bring pleasure to Mr. Montebourg?
I try to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I am sorry.
But the France has a high tax and unemployment also.
The truth does it hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when other countries working eight hours disabled the France.
In India, in China and in full elsewhere, working 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I have no prejudices on the France.
What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good facilities and is well situated and has space to grow.
Why Titan has so much need for this plant?
Titan has no need to buy this plant.
But with a fair price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
What type of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think that 100% of the employees have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan buys Goodyear closed factory.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to the Poland or any other country of the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows this.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paying jobs.
Titan accepts to recruit among some 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
Also Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment of Titan before attempting to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
Therefore, there is more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were willing to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Confirm you?
The only number I have mentioned to the Minister, it is 333.
I know that he would like a four year warranty.
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the proposed purchase of the plant starts with zero employee.
How can we give guarantees of job duration when there are more people on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg what the CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buys the factory, we have well intend to stay in Amiens North more than four years.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles international airport.
It was 10 o'clock in the morning local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
It would be an employee working for the Administration for the safety of transport of the United States (TSA) and the author of the shots.
The incident occurred at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Soon the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of the airport parking.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
The supreme court validates the Obama health system reform act
Major victory for the Obama administration: the US supreme court said today that the reform law ratified by Obama health system was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, judges have validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Act on the patient protection and affordable care) - which requires that citizens endorsed health insurance by 2014, under penalty of paying a fine - and stated that it was constitutional under the power to tax by the Government.
President of the supreme court, John Roberts, joined with four of the Court's more liberal members, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also approved the other sections of the Act, 2 700 pages and, on the other hand, considered that the provision of the Act, reform of the health system, which requires lowering the eligibility threshold for Medicaid under penalty of losing all federal funding program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the presidential election in contention during the primaries by 2012, including the designated candidate Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Aretha Franklin will go on stage in December
The Detroit News reported that the Queen of soul will occur on 21 December at the Sound Board, MotorCity Casino hotel room.
Dr. Franklin case in November in the recording of an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease which she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told media on 16 October that the side effects of treatment she received were 'difficult'.
It claims to be "happy to be back".
Should be taught myths and legends to children as "models of lifestyle", says the author.
The legend of Thor could show that 'brute force does not match the subtle ruse', while the Arthurian Legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be «much too violent, far too outrageous and in some cases, well too obscene to be taught at school», Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" works suited to the age.
"I find it amazing that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I would argue in favour of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly didactic" made that children 'drop out completely", the messages being 'sublimated' into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf of anglo-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "you may be well-intentioned, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finish well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than being declared.
The known base what we watch and what it does not say.
Green light from the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merge
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday had received no objection on the part of the US authorities to their merger, approximating thus to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger indeed close the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiration of the prescribed time of consideration of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", announce the two groups in a press release.
They indicate that they have also received the necessary permissions in the Canada, India and Turkey, after the South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of review under the HSR in the US and issued authorization decisions in other jurisdictions meet many of the conditions necessary for the realization of the operation.
"The merger is also conditioned to obtaining other regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups", they added.
New class action against the Holy Cross brothers
A new application of class action filed against the brothers of Holy Cross, concerning sexual assaults which would be held this time at Saint Joseph's oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The query relies on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J"., which would have masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher submitted brother and then by her confessor, father Bernard, at the St. Joseph's oratory, where he was serving mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal did only three establishments, and when it was announced the regulation, many people told us: 'I was at a particular location, can I register?', says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two actions.
The lawsuit which has just been tabled is to feature to allow the addition of complainants of any establishment where abuse could be perpetrated by members of the congregation of Holy Cross.
At the present time, the appeal brings complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since many of the institutions concerned have closed their doors in the 1960s.
The use also stresses that the congregation of Holy Cross and the St. Joseph's oratory, which is a separate entity, "have enabled sexual abuse are perpetrated against children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological victims constraint", that they "were aware of sexual abuse perpetrated and them have nevertheless choked", and that they have "knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latest accusations are based inter alia on letters written by counsel for the St. Croix, Me Émile Perrin brothers, in the 1990s, but also by the research done in the archives in this regard by brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Holy Cross brother who publicly denounced the abuse.
Collective redress must first pass the stage of admissibility in the superior court.
Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, we proceeded to the second step, either the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Holy Cross had agreed to settle before hearings are conducted on the bottom.
DRC: the army is preparing a new assault
Children play on a charred tank which belonged to the rebels of the M23 at Kibumba, October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday to a new assault against the last strongholds of the rebels of the M23 near Bunagana, in the East of the DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the Bugina Hill, which overlooks the Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
It will more than Runyonyi Hill remain.
"That of Chanzu is not very strategic," said has the AFP the Governor of Nord-Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel Saturday has Bunagana.
Fee policy and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred diehards from the M23, are holed up at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the hills agricultural Chanzu Runyonyi, Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba

According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the previous day and were buried.
A girl was injured by gunfire, and three others were injured, which one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC said the witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebel October 25, both sides gave no assessment of the loss of human lives.
The Court blocked a decision on policy control and excavation of the NYPD
A federal appeals court has blocked Thursday the decision of a judge requiring changes in the program control and search of the New York City police department and it has been divested of the folder.
The Court of appeal of the United States second circuit) stated that the decision of judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has appealed its conclusions and its remedial orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it.
The Court of appeal heard Tuesday arguments on the request for a stay.
The appellate court said that the judge had to be relinquished jurisdiction folder because it has violated the code of judicial conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black men and Hispanic under their control and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including reform of policies, training and supervision, and she ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the districts where the largest number of controls take place.
In August, New York City has agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping names and addresses of persons whose case is dismissed after a police control.
The hearing of the appeal of the city should be held after March 14, 2014.
The tactical control and the search has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
This system of control and search existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls increased dramatically under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that were mainly focused on black men and Hispanic.
Legal action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Proponents advocating changes in the program and control the NYPD search say they will put an end to unfair practices, will provide police forces more effective and which have trusted, and can change the way police departments make use of policy.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the broader forces of police under pressure problem after police numbers have been greatly reduced over the past decade.
The judge noted that it was not end practices control and search, that are constitutional, but it reformed the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
The NSA revelations increase the paranoia of businesses with regard to the monitoring of State
A beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of the Germany.
Order of the federal Office for protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of information German, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost located within 5 km of the Central Bank European and the Bundesbank.
German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of antennas to listen and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of U.S. intelligence services, insisted again in September on the fact that the United States do not use their foreign intelligence capacity to "steal industrial secrets from foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who became consultant, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure trove of information on the secrets of the supervision of the United States, European Governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the Director on floor.
Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US providers of storage in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused the paranoia of businesses with regard to the monitoring of State.
The revelation that the phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, maybe even for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be referred, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made transparent the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"The Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the it sector.
The German companies think that the United States pose a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy EY.
However, in documents released by Mr. Snowden, no indication to date that the United States have passed secrets to foreign businesses to U.S. companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern to the idea that the EU lacks computer capabilities and sufficient Internet and think that it should endeavour to reduce its dependency on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical on this subject.
A member of the German Parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I cannot close the eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do", said Hasso Plattner, president of the society of German enterprise software, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European industry, then we must not starve it 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, coal cars, passing by the farmers.
Everything except the it industry.
Yet, the scale and sophistication of the U.S. exposed by the revelations of Snowden spy agencies were a shock for some companies who thought until then that China represented the greatest risk in terms of monitoring.
A big change is happening in cloud computing because European leaders have become aware of the fact that the data stored in the United States are governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, about 10% of the non-American members gave up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cloud after the revelations about the American Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, Co-Director of SAP, says: "our customers today ask us a question that they did not pose a year ago: where my data are kept and can you assure me they will physically remain in this Court? ''
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they knew already, namely that powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
Is always there.
"This is a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, Director-general of the BASF chemical company.
Americans spy us on the commercial and industrial map as we eavesdropping, as it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate executives are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would allow the advantage to an opponent.
Large corporations hammer the message that it is for the less foolhardy to retrieve a free USB key at a tradeshow or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room for a long time.
Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Directors of the German automobile manufacturer Audi, said the collection of mobile phones before the meetings of the Council, so that they can not be used as a remote listening devices, is a common practice for many years.
The BfV of Germany advises its officers to consider use of simple mobile phones prepaid when traveling abroad due to the risk of harm to the integrity of the smartphones.
Prepaid phones are then thrown.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their secrets against unauthorized access", warns the BfV in a report.
The United States alert their own companies on the economic espionage activities by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) realise made in February by the United States, cited France, along with Russia and Israel, guilty to second-degree have performed acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of a renowned German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former Director of french domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "the services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
A tax on real estate foreign owners to burst the bubble of London
Treasury has provisionally costed the measure of the tax on capital gains but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne that the 2012 budget, included a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than 2 M£ and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold properties in a society rather than as individuals.
The stamp duty already applicable to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea and represents 708 M£ on fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of the Ireland of the North, the country of Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and the Yorkshire region and Humber gathered.
Mr Cook said: "following the increase in the stamp duty on properties of high value and the introduction of law anti-avoidance rule in the matter, it very difficult to move forward that valuable properties are sous-imposées regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners reluctant to the idea of selling," he added.
The real estate - the 5 to 10% of the price the highest in the real estate market - in the prosperous area southwest of London that stretches from Fulham at Wimbledon, has increased a record percentage of 11.8% over the last year.
Prices in Central London show steady growth from year to year by 5.6% but have been overshadowed by an 'internal market' growing southwest of the city, Northern (7.4%) and Eastern (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills studies.
The shutdown in the US slowed the rise of the automobile market
The closure during 16 days of most federal agencies has weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showed figures published Friday by the manufacturers, five of the six main having performed below expectations performance.
The big three Detroit automakers displayed from October 2012 two-digit growth but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average 15.4 million sales annualized and seasonally adjusted pace but the market amounted to 15.3 million estimated Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley analyst.
In a note to the Bank's customers, considers that this lightweight braking stroke is explained by "the Government 'shutdown' and its impact on the sense of the consumer during the first fortnight of the month".
GM nonetheless reported an increase of nearly 16 percent of its sales last month at 226 402 vehicles, against 211 563 expected by the consensus.

A study to the advantages of the HS2 for Scotland railway project was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that the high-speed services to Scotland and the North of England will start at the outset of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "would gather the United Kingdom.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said "excited" at the prospect of working with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government has revised upward the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and the North of England, from 32.7 Md£ to 42.6 Md£.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity strengthening and improvement of the length of the trips to the North of England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh for three hours at most.
The Baroness Kramer said: "our goal for HS2 door on a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities."
We push the HS2 project because the advantages are huge.
Without him, we are facing a problem of our rail network capacity.
But it is also to develop connectivity between 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that between them are best thanks HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, said: "today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
The Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support 'unequivocal' inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "high-speed rail has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to Scotland, but he also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network in Britain.
"We are so excited at the idea of working in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the train network at high speed to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already being planned.
"I'm looking forward to read the report with British Ministers next year and we will then decide together the next steps."
The United Nations welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will start now to work on a new set of targets to replace the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to fight against poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the 'sustainable development objectives"to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on sustainable development that began the previous day in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, to be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the Summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the Summit that it was now time to "exceed national interests."
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and to adapt the process to set targets of universal sustainable development (ODD)", he added.
These ODD will build on the progress made in the context of the Millennium development goals and will form part of the framework's development post-2015.
I will do the maximum to discharge the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex."
The Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
Sex male or female of newborns will longer assigned, rigidly at birth to them.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter a sex "indeterminate" or "not specified" on his birth certificate.
The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure weighing on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against the intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain patchwork created doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that a child on 2,000 born each year, is a boy or a girl.
They are intersex, intersex forming part of the Group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosomes or atypical gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could be intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and issues of sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea.
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from diseases extremely serious requiring surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science that is how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question about why this happens.
It's like the mystery surrounding homosexual persons.
A report submitted to the Commission European 2011 described transgender, and intersex people as different from transgender people since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination which were faced by intersex people and transgender people in employment, as well as the scale of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-compliant kind now have camps specially intended for them.
The Australia and the Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, an Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized "neutral" after winning his appeal hearing which allows it to keep a sex "not specified" to life.
German passports will contain a third designation next to M or F - X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country have signed a petition that the "gender theory" be removed from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also objected to the German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where the genre is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, it reverses two other pillars of civilization."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant has also reported on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex is assigned to babies at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child", she said the site aimed at young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, named the magnificent Greek God who had a dual sex.
And a decade ago, the medical community considered the genus as a slate, which can be clear and on which we can redraw.
But now, many are those who call into question the ethical basis of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his gender reassignment when it will grow.
"In the middle of 20th century, called this a psychiatric emergency", reported Drescher.
When these children were born, it was not called the psychiatrist, it phoned the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of the Johns Hopkins University, who considered that the genre is malleable.
He spent the term 'sexual identity' and argued that social and environmental signals - how parents raise a child - interact with genes and hormones of a child to shape so that it be identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as the "John/Joan", his theories have given rise to controversy.
It had recommended that the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a circumcision sloppy to castrate entirely, also removing the testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Money has presented this as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.
At the age of about 15 years, he became a boy and is married to a woman.
But at age 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeating this model.
But in the years 1990, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say '[that] they are not satisfied with the result.
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a writer of 36 years of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or small penis and were convinced that he could never have a 'good life' as a man.
So shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical removal of the external body and the testicles and was raised as a girl.
It has been taking female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I was not a girl", he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At age 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical records.
What he discovered horrified him.
I have been sterilized at birth - and nobody had ever tell me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body to produce enough testosterone to keep his sexual organs develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man, following treatment with testosterone and is made remove the breasts.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to standardize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, feared that the German law "invites labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists worry that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an"indeterminate"sex", she said.
We are afraid that it is encouraging interventions.
We believe that it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we have not seen that the law would give, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind", she added.
The German law for the allocation of the sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead to this age there.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German Act "empower" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptor, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today 29 year old Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or of surrogate mothers.
"The Statute leaves flexibility to parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions", said Baratz.
This leaves them time to do some tests and to understand, and a delay before entering 'male' or 'female '.
Thus, everything's okay - you can raise your child and loving it.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the fun of being a parent.
You do not rush you to a surgery that is irreversible.
"This places children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what it takes," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex it feels the most uncomfortable - and this is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a gun in Muy for Halloween
Minors aged between 9 and 13 years were door-to-door for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the District of Muy visited by children has opened the door, taking his shotgun.

His weapon was seized.
The cry of despair of a voter for Obama
I voted twice for president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He said that Obama had made commendable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare, or drone attacks site
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I am trying to read a terribly sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and means me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients medical reports at night and I go to bed, this book next me to the time where policies inspired millions of people and where speeches could breath.
The election ended with a landslide victory and the newspapers of news presenters have taken the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My classmates have cried with joy and my parents have retained all the logs they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the period of transition from Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82 percent of favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Return to the present is a rude awakening, as out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these days full of optimism, they are as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really occurred in the years that followed the first time where I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put to the credit of Obama's great achievements, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (affordable care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of 'neither seen nor known"and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts aimed at advancing our nation in the area of reforms of immigration, care of public health and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can't any more to provide explanations.
I am on the edge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It can not explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor indicted whistleblowers who reveal the misdeeds of the Government.
It cannot justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor escape from public funding and the overspending during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that said that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence were the "most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration.
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I do not know if it is what I expected.
If, at age 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the political opposition party and events that occur by chance, such as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I listed above appear to be largely the choice of the authority.
This is what bothers me the most.
I vote again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney had a confused and little refined alternative that seemed not to determine its policies or its positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term in being released from the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises which they heard for so long.
Yet, then the index of favourable opinions has dipped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish the many promises which have soared.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting of post-campaign, he said his team need to bounce back on track and remain loyal to their cause.
"I want that we focus on our talent", he said.
We have to remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr President, and I am more in agreement with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those Nathaniel Morris.

RBS suspends two traders on the Forex market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its division market exchange according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of manipulation of the currency market begins to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the regulators in the context of the investigations into the most important financial market in the world, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day.
Two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of enlargement of the survey, which echoed the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The Bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed earlier this month have received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators", said a representative of the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had sent folders of emails and instant messages sent and by a former trader at the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European Manager of trading spot currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Manager of the trading of foreign exchange cash at Citi, has been placed on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior trader of currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been the subject of no charge.
The record of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent and by bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, have added some sources close to the case.
UBS said this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the Forex market in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the competition authority Swiss Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - examine the allegations made concerning bankers would be agreed to manipulate rates on the Forex market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also launched investigations internal or received requests for information from regulators, said sources close to the case.
Banks skin instant messages and emails sent for years to find any cases of wrongdoing.
News concerning these investigations have shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth of the units of trading of investment in recent years banks, but who gave in question this year due to the low volatility currency that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but the senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high daily change, fragmentation transaction volume of liquidity between management platforms exchanges and use more more frequent by the banks of their own internal platforms 'explains it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at cheap.
The news came the same day where Credit Switzerland announced referred a trader working in his office at the London Stock Exchange traded funds this week after he caused a loss of 6 M$ at the end of last year.
The Bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled," said a representative of the Credit Switzerland.
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal "will be redrafted.
A Chinese newspaper which launched an appeal on the front page for the release of a journalist charged with libel will be redrafted, says the press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen has subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete overhaul", said the regulator.
The order of "realignment" emanates from the administration of Guangdong for the press and publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned in the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several erroneous blogs on Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The drafting of New Express was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He said that he had decided "to impose a penalty of an administrative nature to Chen Yongzhou pulling his press card".
It also has "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended an inquest on those responsible in New Express and immediately adjusts the newspaper's management team.
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on financial irregularities alleged a construction called Zoomlion machinery manufacturer.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two times a call on first page for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted having published false stories for money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public", he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mostly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following the apology from Mr. Chen, New Express issued his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked articles.
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
The experts say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law which was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to incriminating himself.
Is Obama walks back on its reform of the health system
Under a barrage of criticism, president Obama returned yesterday to clear and oft-repeated promise that "If you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it".
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their service providers, Republicans criticized the president during the last days in accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama has adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said to a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls «an effervescence in the news» about terminations, president Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain complete and more responsive health plans for the same price or even cheaper than expected for.
"You exit winning", he said.
The Administration announced that it would be surprised if the 5% of the population who get themselves their insurance were forced change of regime as their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better", said Kathleen Sebelius during his testimony before the Committee on energy and commerce in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had failed "miserably".
"I am also frustrated and irritated that anyone", she added.
I look forward to regain your confidence.
It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who delivered this sentence, while she believed his microphone cut, in addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly of yesterday following an exchange of points of view contested with Billy Long, representing Republican Missouri, whether it should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has ceased to ask insistently Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive insurance sponsored by the Government to purchase a system via HealthCare.gov, that it now boasts millions of Americans.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen brothers, Grand Prize at the last Festival de Cannes, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and music folk who was just starting to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography comes from be the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this film packed with humour where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac turns a musician and accomplished folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaving the pop for folk with a contagious jubilation.
About Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in "The Great Gatsby" less bright apparel, a soft-spoken when she sings, but the expletive debited machine gun when she talks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week the trials and tribulations of a folk singer who is unable to drill and angry with the whole earth.
It accepts backwards replacements at the foot lifted in the studios.
Homeless, he toured the sofas of friends who still want to receive it.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that is what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, which is not careerist but integrates with a self-destructive behaviour", said Ethan Coen, crowned press with his brother Joel's numerous Oscars and awards at Cannes.
Llewyn Davis has not existed, two filmmakers folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time such as the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time prior to the advent of Greenwich village, this area of New York called to become "the epicenter of the boom of folk music which would create international stars" as wrote the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes like a documentary, dusty music label invaded 33 unsold t inhabited by an old priceless Secretary, musical choices from the studios of the time and cafes where singers occurred.
The Coen brothers magic again by integrating a funny character who runs through the film constantly: a magnificent red cat to look cute, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "growing up in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and country".
"My first music lessons have been given me by my grandfather, who taught me to play the guitar", he added.
For Justin Timberlake, the work is needed to "be seen as good", "random may also launch the careers of someone", and "more and more today".
Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star says in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can stop us to express ourselves".
Chevron, second American oil company, reported Friday a decrease of its quarterly profit due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the objectives of the group.
Net income for the third quarter dropped to 4.95 billion dollars, or 2.57 dollar per share, compared with 5.25 billion, or 2.69 dollars per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters on average projected earnings per share of 2.71 dollars.
The Group has produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The society aims 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a growth of 25% of the production expected by 2017.
A major part of the growth in the coming years will come from its projects of LNG in Australia.
Because the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures increased by seven billion dollars in two years and should reach 36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits of production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream (including refining and chemical production) activities have dropped by 45% to $ 380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole of the sector.
Thus the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported Thursday a net profit declining, despite the rise in its oil and gas production.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the American Agency of Security Transport Canada, ASD, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the drama said responding to a call of "multiple casualties".
"The forces of order are on-site," says the airport on his Twitter account, while television pictures showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There has been a shooting," said a spokesman for US (TSA) Transportation Safety Agency told AFP.
The local branch of ABC showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 local (12 h 30 à Montréal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also said the airport.
The Los Angeles Times says that the devices 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
TSA spokesman was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport were suspended.
The NSA spying: United States "gone too far", admits Kerry
The United States sometimes gone "too far" espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in the first admission of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, it is the first time that a U.S. Government official explicitly admits practice controversial in the interception by the NSA communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as did the president, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this happens more in the future", said John Kerry at a conference in London attended it from Washington Thursday 31 October by video link.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks.
Citing the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that U.S. authorities had since foiled many projects of attacks through the interception of communications and information gathering.
"We have indeed prevented that planes fall, buildings exploding and people are murdered, because we were able to be the current upstream of these projects," argued the patron of diplomacy American.
And, said John Kerry at the address of the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been deceived".
But we are trying to gather information.
"And Yes, in some cases, it has gone too far from inappropriately", yet admitted the Secretary of State, who had already to express themselves on this international scandal during a tour the week last in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that president Obama was "resolved to attempt to clarify and conducting a review of these practices so that nobody feels cheated".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, citing documents obtained from the consultant to the NSA Edward Snowden, said that the programme baptised "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by the giants of the internet.
Believe one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the single month of January last - metadata on emails from text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would be held outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, have revealed that the NSA had intercepted massively data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Face the wrath of States Europeans and then leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listens, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, general Keith Alexander, has denied that its intelligence agency has picked up tens of millions of citizens communications.
He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services that is would be seized of these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would absolutely not be Europe, said general Alexander.
And the controversy was extended Friday to Asia.
The Indonesia summoned the Ambassador of Australia, which the mission is charged to be used by the Americans as part of an extensive network of international espionage that has also attracted the ire of China.
Precocious puberty: ageing earlier
Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that the hormones or other chemical substances that are responsible for
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger of precocious puberty
The trend toward precocious puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family issues and health in children.
Should a mother worry about if breasts and pubic hair of his daughter begin to push to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which took place this week in Orlando, Fla., the Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American youth and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as the budding of breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But it was only a slight advance of the age of the first rules during the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while 12-year-old three quarters in 1970.
"Once that chest began to grow, it must be at least two or three years until the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
The time is the test most accurate for how will evolve puberty.
There is a debate regarding what constitutes the real onset of puberty, but it is considered 'early' where the development of the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops - this is something that a pediatrician can follow closely.
A more rapid evolution can justify the tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of menarche and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can curb the growth and a small size at adulthood.
Drug and hormone treatment recommendations are based on the age of the child, development rate, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "control puberty can alleviate some behavior problems and feel for young girls to be different from the others.
The other big problem is understandable: parents want simply that their very young girls have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they are going to handle hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her menarche at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not prepared emotionally.
She returned from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the knowledge of the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible for.
The boys as girls reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls between the ages of 6 to 9 years that binds the percentage of body fat to the onset of puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, mechanisms of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by any economic climate conditions, passing through genes.
Another problem: Although males have hairs on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards a true precocious puberty is not as pronounced among girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the PAA stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We must be careful as to how we identify the real onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinologist pedo working at the hospital for children Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
"This can mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured on the fact that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.

A former hostage in the Lebanon: "the return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut March 8, 1986, with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" came filming a demonstration of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the association of defense of the hostages "Hostages of the world", which he chaired for several years.
Its main objective: the opportunity for the hostages to complain and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Held more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of the Val-de-Grâce Wednesday afternoon, they were able to, since, reunification with their families.
And try, little by little, to resume their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, age 62, grand ex reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages of the world".
On the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of the "Antenne 2" 20 h.
What are your memories of your release today?
On the spot including, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the boot of a car where I meet - without seeing because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He told me "it is released", but I am not sure, and tell me that can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense.
This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They lay down on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
It then arrives on the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
The French lead US to the Embassy of France.
This is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, to the press...
I remember taking a bath for one hour.
And have dinner in a t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to chat with Roger and Mr Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate us from the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, take a private plane that takes back us in France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How your arrival on french soil took place?
It lands at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It is a little brutal.
There's an incredible scramble.
And lots of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I come back and there are plenty.
Descending the stairs of the aircraft, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and home, many bikes follow our car that Roussin leads.
Bikers pull the stuffing to make photos and follow me up to me where I have to make a little the police to prevent some climb.
Media pressure is enormous.
It does not stop, we are well placed to find out...
But the emotion and fatigue condition is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
Out of a hole and suddenly was under the media spotlight.
It is a little complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
But it was the hardest.
The same evening, I am to 8 pm, the next day also I'm on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for one or two months that are a bit like the holidays.
How have passed medical examinations and debriefing DGSE?
I had right to a first medical control in Corsica.
The rest was made in the Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, reviews in all genres and meeting with a psychiatrist.
This is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can count on him, if necessary, remind you that it is not delivered to ourselves.
It is part of the process.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage-takers.
It was logical.
It has not bothered me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I listen to what is being said.
The debate on including ransoms.
Some things Madden me, others less.
I try to separate things between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap of Président de l'Association "Hostages of the world" which lets me put the distance, and seems much more interesting to discuss.
I wonder for example about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, to recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
We must qualify hostage "political" hostage - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once more, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.
But who says that the hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in the Hague is made for that.
Why would we not say to hostage-takers "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we'll bring you to justice"?
It seems to me yet based, legitimate, common sense hit.
This message is heard but not listened to, and this shocks me.
It is my main struggle.

The Wolf of Wall Street: exit second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film with the title role, that of a New York broker ambitious, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will unawares you in his crazy trader role.

La Seyne, relocation due to rats turn to controversy
Earlier that week, a family left his apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Before the urgency of the situation, the Director of the southern Habitat lands office, proposed an exceptional and provisional, to re-house the couple and their three children in a nine T4.
However, the family refused "for financial reason" and the situation is blocked.
The case has assumed exaggerated proportions, considers Joël Canapa, the Director of the office.
Rats, are always there in the cities.
The rodent control company makes two crossings per year, and in addition, we operate, our support each application of the inhabitants.
We thus conducted, since the end of last winter, 64 interventions.
The district is not left to the abandonment, and rats abound in the city.
For reasons of protection of public health and the environment, rodent control products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We have not invited the rats here," defends the father who left her home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon penniless and we expect a new housing at the same rate as the former.
Royal Bank of Scotland will establish internally a defeasance structure ("bad bank") involving 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) to the riskier assets, measure designed to relax relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The Bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of doubtful assets on its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to have thoroughly cleaned it within three years.
RBS also said that it would be a provision for further bad debts depreciation of four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter, an entry related to the constitution of the structure of cantonment.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus reinforcing its ability to lend.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line under the past, the Government having in particular was accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now go forward, we worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a bank really good and build a major bank for the customer and for the United Kingdom", said the new Director general Ross McEwan to the press.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives the choice to the Scots
Another day, another disturbing story about independence.
This time, it warns that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that the journal of Strathclyde indicated possible spin-off economic freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not yet included in the headlines (and expected).
Nobody also said that EU Member States spend much of their time to work around their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything that she wants to get Scots.
So it's a story that is not a.
And if history it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the canard that "independence means the passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, they forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe, in fact?
Why Exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real news about Europe: the great plan of war to unify Europe is definitely stalled.
With the crisis of the euro, the European project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the parties opposed to the EU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative to the Germany, founded only this year and come from nowhere, brought together nearly five million votes in the federal election of September and released (equivalent to our Liberal-Democrats) liberal democratic party in the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the heavy shackles on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that the European draft went too far.
The crisis of the euro doesn't have much to do with national Governments who register excessive budgetary deficits - this was only true for the Greece.
The European system was rather weigh on its exchange rates favorable for German exporters members - that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with a problem of intrinsic productivity against the Germany.
The only recourse is to make the cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels - which is a reason to subsidize the French and German companies of the energy at the expense of the consumer sector - European industry pay twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a prohibitive in terms of cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All gels of salaries in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a cheap American shale gas.
Accordingly, the revolt rumbles, particularly in France, one of the major leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control the Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin has more need of Paris as passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy undermined struggling.
Result: Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the National Front anti-European, has won a critical by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning for the labour party British, who reminds him that he cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically promote the left.
What is Marine Le Pen with its new popularity among the white working class French?
She wants to use the European elections of the year next to create a unique and anti-European anti-monnaie the European Parliament block.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European sentiment and single anti-monnaie in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like «Europe of Nations (sovereign)» free preferred by General de Gaulle.
The Germany and some of its satellites economies could keep the euro, but the France and southern Europe meet their own currency.
I expect that the United Kingdom should take away from this project, and I hope he will sweet eyes in the United States.
However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending walk Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European Agreement provided that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate the Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Scottish Government is - and it is worth noting - the movement political anti-austerite which was the most successful in Europe, since he won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer labour, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A House engulfed in flames in old Québec
A fire that occurred Friday noon in old Québec was quickly subdued.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched at 9 rue Hébert.
The flames are declared in a three quarters four floors House situated behind the Court of the Séminaire de Québec.
All of the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was subdued one hour after the arrival of firefighters, who were likely to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they have really seen apparent smoke.
"Then alarms occurred, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it is pasted here buildings", explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Spectacular jump 'wingsuit' above Bogota
The athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination equipped with wings), it is passed to 160 km/h above the famous sanctuary Monserrate, located more than 3,000 meters of altitude, where many onlookers had gathered to watch his feat.
End of service for the head chef of the Elysée
Entered the 500 m2 elyos kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the Cook through all the ranks to become Chief nine years ago.
He served six french presidents, Georges Pompidou François Netherlands from Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed countless greats of this world in a semi-anonymity that it breaks that today ' hui, at the time of retirement, aged 60.
The man with the open face, skull hairline and glasses of intellectual, born October 24, 1953, in la Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a heading of pastry.
His mother was itself range in a castle of Sologne.
"I went to a castle the other!", quips Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the Manias of the six presidents for which he officiated, but their wives and some of their illustrious also guests.
"It is still the head of State or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, it came directly in the kitchen, to the point that it had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
No offense to heads of State who had a relative indifference to the fruits of the Earth, "they are all greedy", kindly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly larger appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were empty!
As François Holland, who re-established the cheese, "is someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much that he dislikes".
The current head of State, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific plan application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially when the dinners of State at the Elysee: needed "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night preceding is almost white.
These people there would not understand that there are errors.
The now former head of the kitchens of the Elysee, which took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, starts with a pinch in the heart".François Hollande came greet me".
He said praise.
"His human side emerged", he says.
The head will be replaced by his Deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years, which is for its part for seventeen years at the Elysee.
A collision between two vehicles injured four, early Friday, on route 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 h, a motorist travelling northbound to Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and struck a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but it was not feared for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6: 00, Friday.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been sloppy, argues counsel
After the police had confirmed got their hands on a copy of the video which would Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued had never seen a survey "also sloppy".
Me Ruby said believe in the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or downplayed" evidence against the Mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested the friend and chauffeur casual of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35 years, and has accused of extortion on the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the Mayor.
The police said have also observed this man delivering the package to Rob Ford, indicate new court documents.
Me Ruby described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or domicile, or bugged his phone, supporting chosen by the Chief of police Bill Blair informed of not taking action against the Mayor.
Under the Act, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions by hand, could very well have intercept Rob Ford vehicle, stop the Mayor, and perform a warrantless - even.
It could also require a search warrant instant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash said the remarks of Mr. Ruby's "obvious and desperate attempt" to argue with the media in a matter which does not concern.
Press Conference, Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that would constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the Mayor.
A fighter from the armed wing of Hamas was killed tonight and another injured by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists drove a surveillance operation on the border between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a shot from an Israeli tank shells.
German journalists invited to flee from Google and Yahoo
The German journalists Union invited Thursday its members to stop using online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of journalists recommends that journalists avoid until further notice to use search engines and the courier of Google and Yahoo," she said in a statement.
It considers "scandalous" information from the Washington Post, that the national American Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected masses of information in infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"Research conducted by journalists are also confidential details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, Chairman of the Union that boasts 38,000 members.
A room of the Narbonne CGR evacuated Thursday night
Thursday night, the first meeting of a film was interrupted in the Mega CGR of Narbonne, precautionary measure, following stinging throat felt by the audience.
Immediately, the Director of the establishment was the evacuation of the Hall and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell.
about 70 people came out of the meeting.
People were investigated and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on bottom of tear jet?
Or unintentional incident?
The fact remains that the direction of the film played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers at bottom.
The room was airy and everything is back in order.
Cinema was able to resume its rights and customers find the pleasure of images.

Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which injured two serious Friday morning, a grandmother of 52 years and his 5-year-old grandson, is due to leakage of gas from a defective water heater, said Friday night the substitute of the Procurator of the King.
The expert dispatched on-site by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
Grandma lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
Life-threatening of the two victims is still committed.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and was seriously burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and more slightly burned.
"The two victims were intubees and long packaged on-site before being taken to the CHU of Liège, it by helicopter, him by ambulance", said Mayor José Paulet, descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the House was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the House next door, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the Chairman of the CPAS.
Firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée preparedness stabilised both buildings.
A black box in your car?
Then the planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find the money needed to repair highway infrastructure in disrepair, there are many who see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above the dashboard of your car.
Devices which record all miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of an attempted controversial in Washington and Government offices of planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing of the main U.S. routes.
The sector generally uninteresting of the main planning suddenly caused a very lively debate and eventful alliances.
Libertarians have joined with environmental groups to exert pressure so that the Government uses small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and road on which you are possibly, and then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern regarding the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress fail to reach agreement on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They look how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these boxes black, sometimes equipped with a monitoring system by GPS, for an experimental excursion.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It is not as if we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State began recording the miles traveled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do.
The pressure comes as the Highway Trust Fund in the country, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans buy more as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel more miles a gallon.
Tax Federal itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply tenable step", said Lee Munnich, a policy specialist from the University of Minnesota transportation.
His State was recently installing tracer on 500 cars to test a payment system to the mile.
"This is be the most logical alternative to long term", he said.
Wonks call it use to mileage charges.
Not surprisingly, the idea to seduce the urban Liberals, since the taxes could be used to change driving habits to help reduce congestion and emissions of gas, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the ambitious laws of the State on global warming.
But Congressman Bill Shuster (R - PA.), Chairman of the House of representatives Transportation Committee, said that he considered as the most viable alternative in the long term.
Proponents of the free market of the Reason Foundation also enjoy the idea of charging drivers to the mile.
"It is not just a tax funnels into a big black hole", said Adrian Moore, Vice President of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that have purchased them.
The movement is also supported by two former Secretaries Americans to transport which, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the route of payment at the mile.
The US Senate has approved a pilot project of 90 M$ last year which would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to their work or in town.
Several States and cities are nonetheless making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the most important experience of the country.
These motorists will soon pay the State's mileage fees instead of taxes on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 voluntary motorists have recently equipped their car for a device, drivers were worried that the Government could follow their smallest deeds and gestures.
"Concerns about Big Brother and what kind of things are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management in the Department of the transportation of Nevada.
This is not something that people want.
From the beginning of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged Locator devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technology infrastructure which will be inevitably expanded to keep the records of the comings and goings everyday people.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now struggling to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles through a car, but without knowing the location nor the exact time.
If we can do that, said Khan, the citizens will be more comfortable.
This technology research has led some State agencies to appeal to a small start-up from California by the name of True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not training to help motorists who pay taxes to the States.
She was looking to break into the emerging market for auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices that it tests liked the main planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically uploaded by modem.
"People will be more likely to do this if you do not register their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in some States pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners are trying to experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose to have no camera at all, preferring instead to pay a fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the State.
Other States are hoping to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxation device that would be equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance "payment to the conduct" and create a set of data on the speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the advantages offered by the system", said a document on urban planning.
However, some transportation planners are wondering if the entire debate on the payment to the mile is not just a huge diversion.
In the San Francisco Bay area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say that Congress could easily manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
A single or annual tax additional could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume lots of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when you simply need aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, Director of legislation and public affairs with the commission.
If it did that, hundreds of millions of motorists will care of the protection of their privacy and a bunch of other things.
British police issued a warrant for extradition against Assange
The British police today issued a warrant for extradition against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said that it had issued a "notice of delivery' against the Australian's 40 years, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible routes under the British act after the supreme Court invalidated it has appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum to this South American country.
Scotland Yard has "issued a notice of delivery against a 40-year-old man asking him to report to a police station, on the date and time of his choice", said a spokesman.
It continues to breach the terms of his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears to be extradited from the Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting the secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of his Government
The president of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judge that his Government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to deprive Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, said centre-left leader firmly they "intend" to continue to govern with its coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper House of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw support for the Government if the Senate, where there are more opponents than supporters, his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national Secretary of the people of freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the Government, as demonstrated by October 2 his refusal to yield to the demands of Berlusconi who wanted already dropping the firm.
For more than a year, everywhere, I can see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people that I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, fees to no end.
In short, slurping without limit of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay.
All money removed by force to taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, it will interfere with not about lavish expenses and maintenance of lame ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong grant to the city of energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, that we sell them to private enterprise or we demolish them.
It is sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that never came.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso in a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
Isn't tiered public to invest in such companies, but rather to the private sector based on the request of the consumer.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Lakes to fishing and batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (water-intensive) and at the grand decline in population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without wanting to say to the waste, the city will never starve for water and the severe regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In summary, it is easy to do great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than 200 million $, this city is not even able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing Bylaw.
We are managed for more than 40 years of fashion with beautiful diplomas for most and I do not think that a sheep farmer is worse.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning, in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11: 00, on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street in the Borough of Rosemont - La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations took place at this location for some time.
A common foundation wall had been erected during the last days.
The accident occurred at the point where the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was browsing car and I saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the site.
I am landed and I went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
We saw only a part of his back, this is so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim was an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a company of formwork.
Resuscitation manoeuvres have been attempted by the services of emergency, but without success.
Man has not survived with serious injuries.
A Commission of health and work safety inspector was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The NSA involves an "internal error" and hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shade said Friday that it was a bug which caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," said spy agency in a statement by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, servers online trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still not be able to access the site.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, said the spokesman.
At least a group of hacktivists online stated be responsible for the failure of the NSA by DSD attack site.
DSD attacks aim to flood a target site until the servers are overloaded and that site collapses.
The cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated, and attacks are not intended to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
Formerly ultra secret NSA, dubbed time "No Such Agency", is found under the fire of projectors and sharply criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive monitoring programmes presentations nationally and internationally - that are part of the secret files of the stolen from the Agency and disclosed by former NSA disillusioned NSA consultantEdward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the Agency has caused much speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted operation cyber.
Downtown Delta now closed
The hotel Delta Centre-Ville has closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
Investment Fund who owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not found new employment.
Delta promises not to drop its employees.
Employers have come to meet with employees directly on-site, we met individually employees to assess their needs.
"This support there will continue for the next six months," said the regional director of the labour relations of Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of Delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund who was the owner of this building there were choices to make.
Either he réinvestissaient in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions so the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have emerged in Montreal.
"Or is he was selling it to someone else and that is what has happened", says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in tourism at the school of sciences of management of UQAM.
Other hotels in Montréal will be also converted in the coming months, as the Crown Plaza, which became a residence for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will emerge within two years.
Do you want a neon ice?
A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world made from jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate the brilliant protein chemically.
Ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since the cream begins to glow when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, more it licks, more it becomes bright.
Charlie, the founder of the society of ice «Lick Me I m Delicious», said: "this is something incredible but we are still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, increases the pH level and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a special glossy effect.
It's probably ice the most expensive that I created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me so about £140.
But it tastes rather good!
The company to approach experimental Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfumes such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the Medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
One serious injury in an accident with a ghost on the Brussels ring driver
A road accident has been one serious injury Friday morning around 5:30 on the inner ring road of Brussels at height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was struck by a phantom driver, which is free.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00, at the scene of the accident, the time that the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has hardly caused traffic jams because the accident took place in the Hoeilaart exit height.
Therefore, traffic could be diverted by this input/output of the ring.
A seriously injured child in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His prognosis is more engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed until further notice.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the informant of the US intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Thursday with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the Member has presented to media in Berlin Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend."
However, say the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. Government to drop criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of justice, he was accused of espionage and theft of property of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, said at the Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will be sure to make this possible."
Relations between the United States and the Germany were strained following complaints that the NSA had bugged the phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign intelligence services, said that had he had a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "not put in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States", should enjoy.
M. Ströbele, German Green Member of Parliament, has published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to counsel for the former consultant of the NSA, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, should give the assurance that it would be "safe" there, said member of Parliament.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had a campaign of persecution "serious and sustained" which had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to 'my Act of expression policy '.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials - including the United States - have found the revelation of an inexplicable permanent monitoring system utilities.
The letter advance offer of cooperation with the German authorities 'when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of Dolphin to bump off the coast of the northern coasts of the Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible of scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and study of animal and marine environments (OCEAMM) returned to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin you surprised it?
This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly.
If in the past, the species have been described and identified based on morphological, anatomical and geographical, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of the classification of the species.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology undermines the classification or the membership of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, the morphologists have classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are questioned because of advances in genetics.
In the same way, morphologically very close species were distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new species that comes to be identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community had recognized two species of this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
The recent analysis identified four species.
Why is it a discovery of importance as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation perspective, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they knew not that it was part of a new species, this only at this location.
Therefore, if a mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or incidental catch problem occurs in the region, we could deal with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extirpation of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered on the basis of the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the ability to recover from the neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the Sousa chinensis species, with the population of the new discovered species originated, its stock automatically became lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between individuals and populations.
This mixing of genes limit the creation of new species.
Conversely, firmer ecosystems promote reproductive isolation, which can lead to term the creation of new species.
You should know that the marine environment is the less well known medium.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, only 11 km from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money in the search for life on other planets and in marine research and it is high time that this changes.
Clive Palmer argues that the MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The tycoon of mining, who contests a carbon fee of 6 million $, submitted this argument to try to dismiss questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding if carbon and mining taxes must be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only Ministers might have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott girls were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
"It will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to pay parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact whether or not it gets leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax with 53 votes, after recount.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a reworking of the system of votes remains to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished?
"We need a better system", he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to paper to mark the ballots.
Is - to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied the options in relation to e-voting and recently released a discussion paper with the New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, age 59, has said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that it would take his new role "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We seek no reward, except the reward of history because we serve the community at a critical moment", he added.
When many equestrian events experts gathered in Cardiff to compete to win the horse of the year trophy, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years.
Not yet in school and only a few months after his debut, the toddler and her pony Shetland Toffee have trotted for three rounds with great ease, and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable - that are the same size - have been hailed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank, Rudry equestrian center near Cardiff.
Posing against men and women in hats elegant melons, he wore his flat Cap slightly on the side of casual way to scroll through his old Toffee pony of 2 years around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural qualities of dressage, unusual for a child of his age.
And Toffee has received very good grades for his presentation and his personality.
Fenton took Toffee gift for her 3rd birthday in March and trained since with its Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years, said: "Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo."
They presented themselves and against all, but both won the Gold Cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he competed with Toffee and we were overjoyed that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who participate in equestrian contests for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: "there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged him and applauded him."
He traveled the length of the track power and even though it seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he dealt with.
How it started, it will surely participate soon in the manifestation of the horse of the year – and I am sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton was only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They form a good team.
Judges have noticed that Fenton and Toffee showed well and the way in which they marched on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the Pony and the trainer - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure that his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, there really look great.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all the soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and the new Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson has ensured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a plan of transition in collaboration with their superiors.
All the wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before you are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the Government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured - which do not meet the "universality of service" rule requiring army personnel is able to perform a series of tasks - to reach the qualifying period of 10 years required for retirement benefits.
They particularly cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay one year more in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case has occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary Committee, last month, that he was pushed towards the exit before being ready because it did not meet the universality of service rule.
Mr. Hawkins said that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but this was totally different as the fact you want to leave the ranks.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former Vice-Governor of Jilin province, northeastern China, was sentenced Friday to prison for life for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was alleged to have hit more than 19 million yuan of bribes, reported the official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, has helped companies and responsible for contracts, loans or promotions in Exchange for money or gifts, said the first intermediate court in Beijing on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of State promised that justice would be as uncompromising with the powerful "Tigers" that with the "flies" - officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having referred the highest office within the State.
But the Government has no intention of reforming the system of combating corruption for example by creating an independent body of the party.
The benefit of Bombardier on the decline, while shipments and orders for aircraft are receding
Bombardier Inc., aerospace and rail constructor Canadian, has reported a 15% fall in profit net Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and deliveries of airplanes in the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, nor did flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or any information to determine if the aircraft will meet its ambitious timetable for business commissioning before next September.
After the maiden flight of the test about a month ago and a half aircraft, he stole only three times, and the question then arose whether the testing phase was on the right track.
Results have not been up to the forecasts and the share price fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered Thursday its rating from "outperformance" to "performance of sector" due to the low potential for increase in the stock market during the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely party early, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the transportation division", Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft that the flight test programme progresses.
However, if no new command is announced in the coming months, we expect that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family can the Catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for the CSeries is modest so far at height of 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the claims of society concerning energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new airliner.
At the present time, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and Chief Executive, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before starting commercial operation of the first aircraft.
Leaders have also reassured analysts and media Thursday indicating that the programme progressed according to schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected", said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that tests on the ground and the software updates were provided during the downtime of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to proceed with a first flight and a period of update, and this is what we did.
It happen throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, said the company.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can do steal a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was currently assessing the timing of entry into service and provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although it is apparently consistent with the internal calendar of Bombardier - strengthens our opinion that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to 147 M$, or 8 cents per share, compared to 172 M$, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 Md$.
Analysts had expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world said that it had delivered 45 planes during the quarter, against 57 a year earlier.
NET bookings have fallen to 26 planes, against 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division accounted for 32.9 Md$ September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In aviation, results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the General conditions of the market have been disappointing", said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautical revenues decreased 13% to reach 2 million$.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer in the world, said that the revenue of this division increased by 11% to 2.1 Md$.
The transportation division order backlog totalled 32.6 Md$ September 30, is a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division suffered problems concerning some large contracts.
The leaders announced that new evidence would be supplied during the fourth quarter.
The course of the shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc., would sit on the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5% to $ 4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, third constructor aeronautics in the world and competing nearest Bombardier, said Thursday a drop of 10% of its quarterly profit.

According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine enough to paralyze most of FM stations".
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the "lively blogosphere" of Kenya.
In silencing the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist for The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a source of key control in public life.

An inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches his party in the suburbs
Let us particularly make no mistake.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Donedat, its founder, the "party of the suburbs" applies not only to commuters.
I chose a map of France as its logo, justifies t - it.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, is born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great melting pot that characterizes all neighbourhoods.
My proposal n ° 1 is to create a Ministry of multiculturalism, says - it.
Abdel-Malik Donedat, 50 years, territorial attached, now claims as "100% apolitical" even if it has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 along with Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left but if the right people are willing to support me, I will also listen to them, he says.
There is only to the extremist parties that I speak.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel - Malik Donedat has built its program - searchable on the Internet - from many themes supposed to talk to the inhabitants of suburbs and including young people: the right to vote to foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, civil majority at age 16, the rehabilitation of the caretaker function...
Remains to find candidates to form lists and defend its ideas on the political scene"."For the municipal elections of 2014, this may be just, he acknowledges".
It is a problem of time and money.
The party in the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.

Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a test "of authenticity.
The Government is currently studying the possibility of implementing a test "of authenticity" for foreign workers to a 457 visa while it plans to extend the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied as a criterion to prevent visa 457 be used to occupy unskilled positions or as a way to bring his family and friends in Australia.
A Government discussion paper was unveiled today while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the Government speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend the neighbours of the Australia.
' Sensational statements on 'foreigners returning at the end of the queue' and "jobs for the first Australians" are an unpleasant return at the time where the unions demanded a protected labour market ", she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of white should be protected - and I would be not surprised that some countries in the region see as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper made the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with officials to discuss trafficking human, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the test "of authenticity" was adopted, a visa applicant could be controlled to know "If the job offer is authentic in the case where the candidate is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or of the person concerned within the company that sponsors it".
Companies may also be required to report the number of holders of visa 457 after some of them, having had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers, to have in fact used hundreds.

Questioning of the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal restored certain restrictions on the right to abortion that had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week in Texas.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this State and handing broadly the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The judgment of the Court of appeal means that physicians who practice of abortion will have "privilege of admission" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under health care membership of a hospital to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to there issue a diagnosis or treatment.
Abortion advocates argue that the contents of the Act may result in immediate closure of one-third of the State clinics because these clinics were unable to obtain this "privilege for admission" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions.
Monday, a judge of first instance had considered on the eve of the entry into force of the Act that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who seeks the office of Governor, asked the Court of Appeal set aside the trial judgment that blocked enforcement of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for the month of January.

The supermodel's 22 years does not begin his career in the cinema by the back door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to embody young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic tragedy shells, in eight chapters which will be released in two parts (1 and 8 January 2014), erotic memories of an addicted mugged sex since adolescence.
The likeness of Stacy Martin with his eldest is striking: a silhouette of twig, a diaphanous complexion and Anglo-French origins.
Not forgetting a certain taste for risk: that had not hesitated to lay naked on glossy paper will be displayed in many situations more sulfurous on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac upped the temperature on the canvas: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his players to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to professionals of the X for the most daring sex scenes, before to merge all body digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has used to push his actresses to their limits, always for the best.
Stacy Martin has not finished to talk about it.
Five years ago already that my father is erased from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "attend".
There is no recipe, instruction to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong felt his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in full night to look at his watch that leaves me more, placed on the bedside table.
It is the image of my smiling father accompanying me in my actions on a daily basis.
Our mother has left us after his exhausting cancer fight.
This is at least what I thought the day where I found his empty body, tense on this bed of hospital in the wrinkled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral were an icy farewell focused around the meager glow of candles that framed his coffin.
I thought that it was a party.
Gradually, by small diurnal or nocturnal, a little shy, a little erased appearances, she is quickly back in my mind, evolving as it took its place in the landscape of my thought that believed in mourning.
And then she was all in revealing me my own facets that I had not yet seen, hidden by my relationship with it.
So I've learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I didn't really, a woman who embodied this person during his stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfect his life and released the person I loved, and here I found it, full.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that the people loved never leave us.
I look like my father, "to the inside as to the outside' it seems.
They always told me.
I've never believed it at the time.
I had a relationship difficult with him until he becomes old, sick.
There, I was more afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I had fear, when I got hurt...
He spoke to me, encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I paid him my body.
But it was never a secret.
I have had a personal life.
It left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he is gone.
Ultimately, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, recommended.
I don't know who said that deceased persons are not of forgotten but some invisible.
My parents are no longer but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I referred always: what would they say? What would they think? that would - they made?
I dream constantly of them, maybe not every night but several times per week that's for sure.
I dream often of the last moments that I have to share with them until it was too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me to do right now.
I wake up often anguished when that happens to me, and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, certain dreams lead me to the contrary and fit into my story and actually, they continue to live and to share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I needed to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I hissais me out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and smiled me and rejoiced that I wait a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had me visited in my sleep for mean me he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him, and I take pleasure to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of the continuations of a cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family in Cuba.
Hence the shock that her disappearance resulted in the young Bachelor I was at the time.
I still did my grieving pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in the moments where I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learn Arabic and my interest in the Middle East, to the point to make a master in a large school, were not, in hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about the Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values that she taught me are still present, although I happen to think how it would I be at any given time.
It goes same for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and righteousness of mind that was a devout believer.
Now, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a salutary spirit.
I see his eyes land on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that fire alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time has soothed the penalty.
Remained that the lack, this vacuum without response, the need for it, assign me to reassure me in the hollow of its sweetness.
Yet, it is there, silent presence, it is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see her worried eyes land on me, I see the rings that weigh down his eyes, wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, folds that mark the front day of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning I diverts eyes.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer at age 43.
You feel permanently its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, then it has slowly relearned to smile, and pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Ofcourse, I talk to him in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, it invites itself in my dreams when morale suffers a bit.
We feel doors and protected in difficult times, the passing of time makes us realize how much she was Chief conductor and we try to stay in the lane that she had charted.
If someone you loved very strong, the absence can you pull it off the heart and memories.
Somehow, loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he was thinking or what he enjoyed.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a baby boy.
If I have my sometimes different convictions of his own, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in an opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he would think.
I do not know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is - this genetics?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, he did not need to talk among ourselves.
In short, it is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
This is nearly thirty years that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The huge penalty which then invaded me is of course reduced but it is always near me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams in a way so precise, so alive to wake up I'm still sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was OK, I told him no, me answer "I get off" but with a voice so real that I woke with a start, anxious and I turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same House, and often I feel observed and I turn to see if it is not there, I know it's him, and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
Nothing in the world I'd leave this House where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I always lived alone since his departure, it is and will be the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a business liability, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am Grandma, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talks about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.

This organization relying on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.

Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the news de Tahiti newspaper containing information of Radio Australia.
This island, to the East of the archipelago of Gambier (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, at halfway between the New Zealand and the Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It is British since its occupation in 1790 by mutineers from HMS Bounty, episode in the history of the English Navy, which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, the majority of the descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their revenues depend on 95% of the generosity of London.
The Island Council has voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, either 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A Deputy Mayor of the island went to London ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the Mayor of Pitcairn, considers that the creation of such a protected zone would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for the island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom of sanctuariser these 836,000 km2, on condition however to have the means to ensure the monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to be based one or more aircraft dedicated to the monitoring of the zone, and there is no port where to place monitoring military vessels.
As for France, it must already conduct very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, Pitcairn neighbour.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a local of the national party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle going to a local of the neo-Nazi party dawn Golden in the Western Athens suburbs, was learned from police source.
The police was not able at the moment to give information about the identity of the victims and their eventual membership policy.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards of their local.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
The police's anti-terrorist unit is were dispatched to central avenue in the suburbs neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and have cordoned off the area.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six members of Golden Dawn, including the head and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after an anti-fascist musician's death by one of its members.
The parents of a Georgia teenager who died in unusual circumstances, think that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a fight carpet rolled in his high school gym, think that their son was murdered, said counsel for the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, Valdosta in Georgia, was found Jan. 11 stuck in a carpet supported standing behind the bleachers of the gym at his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff investigators have concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They have never thought that he was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the Sheriff.
"They think that this defies all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
They believe that these conclusions were delivered solely to cover the persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a satchel and it rendered it them in a body bag," he added.
The Attorney of the United States Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Johnson, stressing that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to uncover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve a response or confirmation", he said.
Moore said that if he puts on the day of the elements that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson, he will ask the FBI to lead it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered Wednesday to the authorities to hand over all the video surveillance records that investigators had examined.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that video images contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
The former head of the Gestapo, buried in a Jewish cemetery
Muller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever found its trace, in fact was buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial to the German resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte", assured the circulation daily in relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would meet one of the greatest enigmas of the post-war period.
The German secret service, the BND, provided as well as during the summer 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally mistaken.
"From August 1945, Müller body was found in a provisional grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a commando", according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a uniform of general".
"In the left inside pocket were including its service with a photo States", he continues.
Bild also published a document from the Town Hall of the Borough of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The president of the central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, has expressed shocked at this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormity of bad taste.
"It crowd roughly of the foot the memory of the victims", is out in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is part of important personalities of the Third Reich who were never caught.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, who decided the 'final solution' and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, head of the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
The Egypt asked the first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of investiture to the Presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Mubarak, who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
At his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first Islamist president freely elected of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He lent oath before 18 judges in black dress of the Court building located on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second Republic", said president Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people has asked the foundations of a new life - the absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability", explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive Governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the Court to cheer the new president, and departing presidential splendour of years Mubarak, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the busy streets connecting downtown to the southern suburbs.
Considered to be the "spare wheel" little charismatic Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech Friday in which he tried to present themselves as the candidate not only Islamists but to all those who want to finish the work begun during the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian president Moubarak.
"The Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State," said Mohamed Morsi, costumed blue and Red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with woodwork where it has lent oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his inauguration speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band that played the national anthem while he was standing at attention.
The Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by singing "the people and the army, hand in hand...". "intoned by thousands of people gathered in the Auditorium of the University.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of the Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath Friday in Tahrir square, where the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and has vowed to reclaim the presidential powers of the military Council, which has replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him is gone.
But in agreeing to officially take an oath before the Court, rather than the Parliament as is customary, he bowed to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over.
The speech of Mr. Morsi on Tahrir square is accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Aircraft manufacturers argue about the width of the seats while big orders are at stake
The dispute rages between the large aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the class tourist on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow which takes place of months above.
The conflict focuses on the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights in economy class passengers - who are not always the most courted by the airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiencies in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the aviation industry to put in place a standard requiring a seat with at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) height in the economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing said that it should be for the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul planes, possibly hoping a record of commands at the event which will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The manner in which the seats will be arranged in the back of the plane - in particular, will there be 9 or 10 seats front - is essential for the economic performance of the segment of the «mini-jumbo.
Boeing said that its '777 X' redeveloped to accommodate economy class 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says that, economy class, the concurrent version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics Giants often exchanged blows on technical issues by advertising in the trade press.
Today, Airbus appeal directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777 X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 commands.
Could realize recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against the other at the restaurant, entitled "do you accept it? ''
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in closer seats in regional turboprop aircraft", said John Leahy, Airbus commercial Director.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in the aircraft have not radically changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo has defined the modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average U.S. 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of health.
Waist of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus said that its rival clings to a seat concept, which dates from the 1950s, when the circumference of the unit freshly christened 'jet set' was closer.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch to the width of the seats level would improve the quality of the sleep of 53%.
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus in relation to the width of the seats and asserts that it is not manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that cabin experience depends not only on the width seats.
"This is really to bring flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think should be to carry out their activities", said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They do not want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it's more to have some freedom of movement, but for providers, it is more a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race at the controls of planes for a estimated at least 700 Md$ priced at the market in the decades to come, enough to tip the balance of exports American and European.
As Reuters has indicated for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing claim both a yield per seat in their latest models of long-haul twin-engine 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777 X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 of origin scheme set up in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit cost is low compared to the appliance configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing made it to cram more seats and make its more competitive aircraft by reports in our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of passenger comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
The other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing 777 suggest that many passengers are pronounced for a denser configuration, which can go with cheaper rates.
"A 18 inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from the commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the expert in interior cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-Chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing are not seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose.
Aircraft sellers who are around the world take even with them a meter to check competing configurations.
While is claiming to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircraft configurations with high density to companies low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus underlined the need for greater customization of booths offering wider seats aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other large manufacturer of large modern equipment, experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the industry to put in place a standard size for seats will succeed, but that he could forget the wave of sales of 777 X.
Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel adaptation boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a careful reconstruction of time, but it is also more laborious as it should be.
Taking place in the France of the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young Aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced cruelty without a mother deliberately sadistic superior terminal and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never poured into the lubricity or sensationalism, and it is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
The musical, this beast scene
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or in french, Sung and danced productions take flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found his voice.
It is a revolution: the musical French asserts itself as a successful genre.
Long, Notre Dame de Paris to Mozart opera rock, most of the attempts are entangled in ridicule.
And successes such as Cabaret and Les Misérables wore the Halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage­ ­Entertainment at Mogador has changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle titles such as tubes to success.
The first resumes, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announcement for the following the world premiere of "An American in Paris".
At Mogador, "La Belle et la bête" could well be one of the hits of the season.
On other stages, the music shows like "1789", 'lovers of the Bastille' and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are the diapason of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Stories of musicals' and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do evolve French musicals?
The offer is threader.
There's first "musical performances" evolving at the discretion of producers...
Some use of ­belles projections of images and a ­veritable story as in 1789, the Bastille lovers.
Others make a leap of fifteen back on the pretext that can serve about ­n' anything when you have Matt ­Pokora headlining.
Afterwards, there are musicals with the sumptuous du Châtelet ­productions that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the world of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living ­compositeur.
Internship ­Entertainment popularized Anglo-Saxon variety musicals adapting them in french.
The independent french ­producteurs try a ­percee.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent," "The kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The awakening of the ­printemps" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable as at Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who are turning projects into projects.
The United States, birthplace of the musical, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
Jobs are plentiful between regional, touring theatres, Broadway and off-Broadway...
Talent is also so that the number of positions to be filled.
Why the tours in the province have as successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relation of culture in France.
Little plays toured and is often the Théâtre de boulevard intended for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this ­manque.
These same young who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars are...
Offer beautiful young (often talented) men headlining a musical, it is the assurance of a craze of these girls and their whole family often.
These shows Facebook pages are carefully ­tenues by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith of province.
Mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the halls of France in the same form as in Paris.

Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the place where was born the stand-up in America: nearly 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly before the public, in the tone of the conversation.
The innovation of Fay is perpetuated over the years, to be taken up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of stand-up Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and the major theaters.
"Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were a great success, until they became too famous for playing in a club," said Hirsch.
We have created this festival to be able to continue to work with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", an evening of comedy and music for the benefit of veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
The festival gained momentum, just as the world of comedy.
Many of the entertainers participating in this year's festival went through non-traditional channels, for example presenting shows on small television channels, including Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll made its appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ('The League' themed fantasy joyfully lusty football of the FXX chain) and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation", but it is however best known for his series of videos viral 'Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors to the singular voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate for racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products the world decentralized American comedy.
One of the main factors of attraction of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand up comedian, but he became a film director and Director of accomplished television, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The venue takes place at City Hall, in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in comic DNA of all the work of Larry," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes it down an alley between two buildings and said well, if I lose all my money, maybe I will come live here.
Discovery of a tunnel of drugs between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for the traffic of drugs between the United States and the Mexico, with its own systems of lighting, ventilation and electrical rails, was discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the secret passages the most sophisticated that they had never seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging on a length equivalent to nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, to the United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which allows to easily conceal drug loaded trucks.
The tunnel has been closed before the drugs not to be emerged passing unnoticed, said the authorities.
Authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They incur a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
At Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of the Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge to the drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards with tracks that ran from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana and was going to two warehouses in San Diego.
The Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
The Syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with poisonous gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring body Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the North of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day in advance on the date limit of
1 November set by the organization based in the Hague ordering damask "make unusable" or destroy all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing the toxic gas and fill the ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable aimed at destroying chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, the Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of weapons and the existing reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of products and chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the agent nerve agent sarin.
The announcement was made while the fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, who, according to experts, is home to a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory of the rights of man based in Britain.
The Group of militants, who follows the evolution of the human toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the side of the Government, it is estimated that 29 954 members of the armed forces of president Bachar Al-Assad died, whose 18 678 were 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants and fighters of the pro-Government forces.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 375 5 fighters of the opposition, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated that number since.
Some 2 million people were forced to flee the country because of the conflict.
The troops of Al-Assad are fighting against the rebels, many of whom are linked to the Al-Qaida network groups, Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting have stressed the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors while they must complete their mission, which is to rid the Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues under tight deadlines.
A statement by the OPCW, which works in close collaboration with the United Nations, indicated that his team was "now satisfied of having checked - and saw destroyed - all critical production declared and machines for the mixing and filling.
It added that "no other activity inspection was planned at the moment."
Earlier in the week, inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, said the inspectors.
Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to the Syria, "abandoned and... elements of the chemical weapon programme contained therein had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected.
It was difficult to know at first glance if the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
The Syria submitted a total destruction of its chemical weapons plan which approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director general of the Organization Ahmet Üzümcü, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposed the Sunni Muslim rebels at the Al-Assad Government and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the sect of Alawites, a branch of Shiite islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Observatory for human rights said that there was a large explosion Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of new - South Wales have been accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on sexual abuse of children.
But in his statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that he "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization".
The Director general Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee has been charged with offences relating to child pornography and a physical education YMCA Caringbah Hall monitor has been recognized guilty of sexual assaults on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that it had been aware of the first case but that it was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening of the YMCA statement was inaccurate highlighting, external controls of the YMCA conducted and indicated that the safety of the children was a priority for the organization."
It has been shown before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed he had received second worst assessments of four schools during an audit of the Department of Education and quality made Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21 years, admitted that the personnel management has been a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to check that employees knew that they were required to report any violation of child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys for two years where he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a 6-year minimum prison sentence.
But Mr. Hare has rejected the idea that the YMCA would be a cultural problem preventing staff pointed out the failings of Lord towards the safety of the children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, them was sitting on his knees, told them that he loved and left to play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, which was framed by Lord and who had requested training for the protection of children because it was worried about his behavior, said she found the head of services to the childhood of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who oversaw Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director general said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report those breaches to their superior hierarchical.
Instead, he said that friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, which is that they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views to the Board of the YMCA of new - South Wales saying that, for the Organization, the lesson learned from the "incident" Jonathan Lord should not be "reporting" by staff, and the Board had agreed with him.
Mr. Hare has said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by Executive Director of the YMCA responsible for services to children, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of South new Wales was not a safe Organization for children at the time where Jonathan Lord there was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone at Griffith University told the Committee.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.

A ceremony in memory of the deceased crematises
The crematorium in Père Lachaise organizes, at 1100 hours, a secular ceremony, in memory of all deceased crematises in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and then explain its proposals funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French choose cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study on 6 and 7 September with 1009 individuals, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the reverse: the French prefer interment (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are just 15% to choose cremation.
In his book death in ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and Vice-Chairman of the national Committee of ethics of the funeral, insists on "violence" that constitutes the cremation, for survivors.
There, with the cremation, "a violence made to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There's also a "symbolic violence", which takes the "erasing the uniqueness and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ash.
Why is is accepted without penalty in some Nordic and Protestant countries, it still lived in France?
"Because cremation is new", answers Marie-Frédérique Babu, President of the society of thanatology and author of the book Taming death.
It is tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
Tame the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director-general of the funeral Services of the city of Paris, for the deceased a ceremony worthy than that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a commitment very strong to the Organization of the ceremony.
77 percent of the French want a, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen cremation wants the Organization of a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non believers desire also.
Crematoriums have adapted to the evolution of society.
"For a decade, they strive to avoid family violence of a waiting, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the surrender of the ashes", notes Mr Michaud-Nerard.
70% of establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, carry out the following ritual: host the Assembly, appoint the deceased, connect it to the other, raise it, give meaning to his death, organize a farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium in Père Lachaise, since 1998.
The masters of ceremonies often are people who themselves are converted.
There are also old Catholic priests.
It is in this framework that the crematorium in Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invited the families of people who were crematisees in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is rebroadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium has allowed us to the relay.
Hagel criticizes 9 American States to violate gay rights
Since the federal State has recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses entitled to a Department of Defense identification card and the benefits that come with," recalled the Minister in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these States to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Defense Secretary said have directed the Chief of the National Guard, general Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the Federal Act.
The fronde of the nine States began with Texas that refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the Federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in its refusal by Indiana, the Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior Defense official.
The Pentagon considers the population affected by the active recognition of same-sex marriage to about 5600 people, 17,000 including the National Guard, reserve and retired.
The oil price continues to decline and moved closer to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline Friday while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the greedy Chinese manufacturing sector in electricity is trying to strengthen.
The price of the American reference crude for delivery in December fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The US Department of energy said Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased over 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which showed growth of activity, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that the economic recovery of China could continue to firm up after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that it had not known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil Brent, a reference for international crude oil used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to $108,58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, which presents two new choreographies of group to dance dance: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second blown through the famous Gymnopédies of Satie piano solos.
An evening that allows to see the Prism Chouinard, art, ICT and the black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, forward, end as a line and dressed in black, a body profile.
Henri Michaux ink is projected on the screen.
The body, simple terms, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the entire piece: a series of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, waiting on each side of the playground, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, emerge power.
This game black and white's Henri Michaux is done in relays of solos, group in unison (a mass that makes solo), large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think "Morning glory", where, solo, Chouinard was conducting a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, in line at the forefront.
It is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, always fast.
There will be breakage when Carol Prieur réfugiera under the rug of dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, sobriety without restraint, a part of the poem of Michaux, monotone and monotone in the auction, and continue dancing.
And music again, and the sequence of resume.
This discharge sound and energetic, long, if possible, eventually faint and numb.
As does also the regularity of Visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful Flash - creating images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hair that will include ruffling or these black fabrics that prolong the lines.
But choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, imposed, with his tics.
Result: the body appear flat front designs.
Michaux inks, as forms of Gestalt, open a wider and is imaginary dance, more porous.
Only the late, negative, with her dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, key to the magic.
The public has liked, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopédies, after intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the partitions.
Their blunders in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, pass the couples in love, very sensual, even erotic duets.
Group work, small solos of transitions, sets that are moving, backing vocals, writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, also familiar with Chavez, sporting the red nose, in parades love men and women very polarized.
The loves are carnivorous, leaking or players.
The gestures, the laughter and the squeaks transpose beautifully archaic, grace and the ridiculousness of the body in coitus, beings who are based.
But the piece takes real flight after salvation.
A clown is in scene when the public leaves.
There, everything is permitted: the fourth wall falls, explored worlds overlap, the dancers cabotinent, descend among the spectators, pontificate, smoke, short, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder which remains sensual.
The joy and madness sweat, and this is the art of Chouinard, contaminate the public.

Report: The Obama campaign considered as dropping Biden to Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of president Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event which appears in the long-awaited book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and told Thursday night that the close associates of the president led «extensive into groups and polls work» end of 2011 to see if the eviction of Biden could help Obama for re-election while his hopes were being reduced.
According to the correspondent political Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary general of the White House Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice President by the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of an Exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within Chicago and inside the Oval Office campaign HQ.
Only half a dozen close advisers of president - including Daley, the former head of campaign Obama Jim Messina and the former advisers to the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally to decide against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not improve significantly the chances of success for Obama.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually contemplated to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said that I had considered a range of issues, and it was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at this time, the president was not in form, and so is saying, ' Lord, what can we do? ''
While Daley qualified examination of "concerted", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that re-election campaign had invested heavily to discover if the change would be beneficial in the poll.
"Campaigns spend not much money to polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering to take measures", said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was considering replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss then was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley had said that he did not believe that the president "was aware" of possible change, the former Secretary general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively the question about if political polls had arrived on the desk of Obama.
Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden in the presidential list was examined.
"Maybe," said Martin.
David Bowie: unpublished four listening
The English musician did not finish to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he has concocted a Deluxe reissue scheduled for 4 November, with several previously unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone breathless.
The day of his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disk, Reality, of 2003) and too rare appearances in public, the English musician proved that it could still count on him to flicker the pop scene.
A treat for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to reissue this album, November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real treat for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will take the form of three discs: the original album of unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing four already unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra in total contain ten additional tracks from the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specifically disclosed for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie has done presentations in this beautiful set in a video.
It both introduces each of the drives, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive pouches, a book to share his own impressions, a booklet with lyrics and photos...
And, most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and expertly controlled rock electricity.
Are new recordings already in listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The information, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the Web.
The Informer is double-sided: an ominous intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows to allow room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie wanted to make a small reference to the Rocket Man Elton John, or even to Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in its element when it has more feet on Earth.
Space Oddity, at hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie is once again refers to its strangeness: would it come from another planet?
Enchanting guitar riffs make you want to leave the land.
Bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these titles: in turn informant, man on a rocket, potential Martian...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane characters.
Surprising that there so a mask hand in photography of the campaign the Invitation with the Voyage of the brand Louis Vuitton, which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their commercials, aired from November 10.
A bird hoisted to a platform in the North Sea has been released in the wild
A bird, hoisted after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
It pushed the water rail in a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month until he is back on feet by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue of Alloa centre.
The Director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "this water rail was probably a wintering migratory who came from Northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of the North Sea winds.»
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to seek refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "he was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water rail was in good health when he was released.
Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the service of Netflix video-on-demand via their television in the future which seems not-so-distant.
The subsidiary of Cogeco indicated Thursday that it currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will help to highlight the most user friendly interfaces as well as more options," said president and Chief Executive Officer of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable followed thus to competitors, like Bell, even though the subsidiary of Cogeco does not yet date defines in respect of this new platform.
"We must adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate aim remains to offer tools that our customers do not have access currently.
Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable companies so that its service is available via their distribution platforms.
The President and CEO. of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government in its speech from the throne, October 16.
Ottawa wants to force TV cable and satellite providers to offer customers the possibility to pay for services à la carte.
"It is about two and half years we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important packages of channels, it does not work", stated Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that consultations conducted by the Council of broadcasting and telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
'' It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy in respect of television, '' said the CEO. Cogeco.
The CRTC consults with the public since last week and they should continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated recorded a profit net of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to net earnings of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company says this decline by costs of depreciation related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the cable company Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, to 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in the Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $ 526 million.
Regarding Cogeco revenues, they have grown by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They are $ 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, for the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable revenues have however increased 45% to $ 470.4 million.
The company has lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of clients of Cogeco Cable is growing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned to see the number of clients fluctuate so.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he noted.
It varies from one quarter to one with a very strong competition.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom said that gas pipeline Bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the gas pipeline South Stream in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest projects energy to Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"A historical event took place today: construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, large-scale project the largest in Europe", said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify routes of export from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukraine counterpart, countries through which passes the majority of Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk relative to the conventional ways, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct junction towards Bulgaria, Member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
The Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project will be implemented in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries located downstream from here the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Unknown persons shoot at a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo
Unknown hooded assailants opened fire Friday on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt no casualties, consequence of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, the police general Abdel Latif.

Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will be studying at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diversified reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015, students must pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is required to publish tomorrow its new programs of English and maths - materials to undergo a radical overhaul.
There will be changes in other core subjects next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the exams regulator Office, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and less of course.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Minister, said that there was a "broad consensus on the need to reform our system of examinations to restore the confidence of the public", emphasizing the fact that the GCSE would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time in math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer averaged 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make approximately 138 hours.
Well that there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of use of math time, close to the coalition Government sources reported that the GCSE maths comprehensive - as well as the greater importance attached to the substances listed in the international rankings - would encourage likely schools to ensure more classroom hours.
The programme will place more emphasis on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
The European elite is ready to do business with Britain?
The Business campaign for Britain was launched in April with the promise to bring together firms and to define what the wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the widest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Great Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 heads of business, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We discovered that the vast majority of companies seek now to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and grow while the States of the EU have stalled.
They want to see the Government give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as China, the India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the process long and arduous reform of European institutional arcana.
When asked their views on specific political issues - ranging from regulating monopolies to the laws on products - the majority of business leaders think that control of these key competencies should return to the hands of Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European - 40% of large firms trade area, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agree.
Finally, and what is more telling still, our business leaders survey revealed that a large majority would see Britain continue initiatives for a change of the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a 'significant change' which gives the power to the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high - achieving change in the Treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would see a failover of 16% of the votes for the retention of the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of the accession of Britain to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power back in the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the eurozone is committed towards an economic and fiscal union more close.
The priority must be the jobs and growth in Britain and, as shown by the findings of our investigation, for businesses this means again to focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
Beijing questioned a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The support behind the scenes to the attack came East Turkestan Islamic movement based in Central and West Asia", said the boss of Chinese security organs to a television channel in Hong Kong, according to a video released Thursday night on an internet site.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), was speaking at Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
It is the first time that a Chinese official means a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighur family of the region in predominantly Muslim Xinjiang, border of several countries of Central Asia, precipitated their car to gas cans against the entrance to the forbidden city in Beijing, in a suicide attack which was two dead and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and her mother perished in the fire at the car.
The Etim, claiming to fight for the independence of East Turkistan, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, has been classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese as being responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but his real influence is questioned by several experts.

Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, said: "there was fear that she falls but it has not moved."
Firefighters have been great.
I can't believe that she was up there.
The Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
Standard & Poors rating agency lowered Friday the solvency of the Ukraine, putting in doubt the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The public debt of the country note passes to "B-", sinking into the speculative investment category.
It comes with a negative Outlook, S &amp; P seeing at least one chance in three that she is again lowered within a year.
"It is increasingly unlikely that the Government's strategy would guarantee sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," said the U.S. Agency.
The Agency notes that the exchange reserves of the Ukraine fell by 26% between September 2012 to September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reservations, to which the authorities have massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the Agency deemed more likely a devaluation, which would inflate its debt.
Kiev needs further cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not having paid an invoice for $ 882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of tension with its neighbour Russian, furious at the will of Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU late November.
It was made public in the aftermath of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter on contraction.
Its relatively modest debt exploded these last years and S &amp; P considers to 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.
The country, budget deficit, calls for months aid from the international monetary fund, which in 2010 had granted a credit of $ 15.3 billion and in was unlocked for now only $ 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new slice as long as the country has not adopted reforms unpopular to reduce its deficit, including by increasing the price of gas to the population.
After another unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability", while in "signs of economic improvement".
However, Economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre des études politiques, "cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms are launched in a pre-election year", the presidential elections are planned in 2015, is the expert, asked AFP.
The only hope, it is an improvement in the international situation.
S &amp; P also notes the "uncertainty" to the possible signing of an agreement of association between the Ukraine and the EU, Brussels conditioned the release of the opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Sign the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative consequences in short and medium terms related to the reaction of the Russia", said S &amp; P, who fears "trade restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which represents the quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the case of creation of a free trade area between EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its controls at the border for imported goods.
Singapore moneylenders are taking advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnbroker from the commercial centre of Bendemeer to Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga filed a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay tuition for his daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a House so all my money is gone in," said Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she won $3,000 of Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she said.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of South-East Asia - where the indebtedness of households increases - ValueMax, where she completed her transaction, this week became the third company of loans on gage to be introduced on the stock exchange of Singapore.
Pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money liquid - $1,300 Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, the Pawnbrokers of Singapore take an annual rate of interest effective from 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, the Pawnbrokers have the advantage of not to seek verification of solvency or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to the Pawnbrokers while families are feeling the pressure exerted by the increase in the cost of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the financial crisis world, and cheap credit fueled by a too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low and middle income families are turning to the Pawnbrokers to make up the difference while their economies are experiencing a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poors rating agency cited debt growing households, resulting primarily from the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that the Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the debt ratio of the households/gross domestic product the highest in Asia.
The Malaysia arrived in top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of indebtedness of consumers in Thailand, which came out narrowly this week of a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the rising costs, the people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale] seek to supplement their incomes as they can," said Song Seng Wun, Economist at CIMB, a Malaysian Bank.
Historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made that people rushed to pledge their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70% of the articles pawned in the 200 shops of loan on pledge of the City-State are gold.
People say, 'the price of gold is high, put in pledge the grandmother gold chain and we return the search next month.
In Thailand, the largest operator of loan on pledge, EasyMoney, shops recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past months.
The increase is such in the sector of the loan on pledge ValueMax, operator of the shop to Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to grow not only in the neighbouring Malaysia - where there are already four shops - but also outside of Asia says Yeah Lee Ching, its Executive Director.
The company will finance them using 60% of the 66 M$ of Singapore that it raised this week during its introduction on the stock exchange of Singapore.
While some lenders at reduced rates were subjected to criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they charge, Miss Yeah indicates that pledging offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but that in addition it does not increase directly the debt.
"Clients mortgage assets that they already have, and the fact to monetize their personal property does not increase the indebtedness of households," she said.
Pledging is better in better socially accepted as way to get guaranteed short-term funding.
People who visit the Pawnbrokers are not not only those who have financial problems.
Wealthy people of Singapore will also in the shops of loan on pledge ValueMax for pledge of gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
This can be of the affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for business activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to pass a hard cap", adds Ms Yeah.
Sometimes, they just need money very quickly.
The cocaine addict lawyer who informed a godfather of drugs to a police investigation was imprisoned
Ballard ALTID, 42 years, provided information to the crime Lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed in broad daylight
He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years by the Court of Liverpool Assizes
A great defense attorney, who had informed a sponsor of a major drug investigation by police because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Ballard ALTID, 42 years, gave sensitive information to the crime Lord Neil Scarbrough concerning investigations into his activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "record of first importance", was arrested at his in 2011 as a result of operations of listening to police directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers have spotted Scarborough, 32 years, trying to drop three bags of cocaine at the home of lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a 'regular consumer' of class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, it has sought to get in illegal way of information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police as part of a major investigation into trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for 1.5 million lbs, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is revealed in broad daylight.
Today in the Court of Assizes of Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, fell from grace after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
Counsel fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had regularly been in telephone contact with ALTID in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and it were spotted arriving at the home of ALTID and placing drug, pure at 60%, under the bins of the lawyer in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough has been regularly in telephone contact with ALTID who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drugs and they are called nine times.
The tribunal heard that Ditta was a 'regular consumer' of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied consume cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they have all been seized and a hair sample was selected.
During interrogation, he said that he had an office at his home, as well as to his place of work and it happened that clients call it home for legal matters.
But the tribunal heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, including some that he had represented, after arrests key to tell them what investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "If someone needs to know that it should not violate the law, it is a lawyer. ''
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer, and has be too involved with individual customers.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug providing the drug to his own lawyer dealer.
Some of its communications will undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
It has hindered the police investigation as much as he was able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour to her profession, but has dishonored it.
He too approached some clients, especially Scarborough, and it has left compromising its independence.
ALTID denied any illegal action and said: "if I was a lawyer corrupted, I'm not, and I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have expected 15 hours, I would have immediately."
But after the hearing, the Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta moved from criminal lawyer criminal himself whenever he began to procure drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has forever compromised it and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organized criminal groups which instructed it to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and create a climate of confidence among the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Serious and organised by the Lancashire crime unit led the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who has been convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice now, testifying its commitment to prosecute criminals to justice.
Let this case serve as warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find and you will translate in the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On its website, Ditta hosted a session of questions and answers about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be counsel to represent clients in the corridor of death in America, his last invited to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate to work.

Fire in a house built in 1850 in Québec
A historic house built in 1850 was engulfed in flames in the old Quebec Friday noon.
The four housing building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three alarms with the fire department.
Fire expressed at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Québec fire protection Service, said that the quick intervention of firefighters allowed to prevent the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in a close manner.
The burned house housed four slots, but no tenant was on the premises at the time of the fire.
Damages were all in all limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but engineers have rejected the thesis of an act criminal.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of more than 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) of Laval caused quite a stir at the direction of the Hospital of the health city, during the year 2012-2013.
Because multiple retirements, maternity / short departures from, the Department of Pharmacy found highly deficient staff.
Missing nearly 30 per cent of the staffing requirements, making it this year 'very difficult' financial, according to the head of the Department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent labour, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a pharmacist engaged full time.
It was not used to troubleshooting, explained Ms. Beaudet.
Have been streamlined or reduced some of our activities within the facility level, the time that things will relocate.
It sure it worked hard to engage our young people [residents in pharmacy] so they come and stay here.
There is a combination of circumstances that we were in a bad situation last year.
Situation improved
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks much more easy for the pharmaceutical Department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists were hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the Department to retain have borne fruit, because four students currently in residence at Laval have also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS.
Now, it's going much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.
This will thus fill our departures from the past year.
Ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012. difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and employs many young women, so with pregnancies, almost always driving to three maternity leave when things go well, she added.
The past year was much more and there is no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

Anger caused by the sentence against one of the bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run by being one of the most wanted men to Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to a sentence of 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of killing of mass for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and were made by numerous injuries.
He was also found guilty of numerous other counts in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches in the Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors requested a sentence of life imprisonment, yet they could ask that the man, described as "Demolition Man" for its reputation as an expert in bomb-making, is sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two twin daughters of 39 years, Jane and Jenny in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the edge of tears, she said that Patek ought to be sentenced to death.
I really think that he should have to follow the same path as other men.
"He should be dragged before the firing squad," said Ms. Corteen PAA.
I have to live every day without other grandchildren, or see my daughters.

Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber there blew up a bag backpacks loaded with explosives barely 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma in the wake of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and it is "death" three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who have been executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should be sentenced to death before the others.
Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others, is not much.
Patek is the last of the bombers of Bali to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill the former head of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden to reestablish links between Al-Qaida and Southeast Asian terrorist groups.
"He did not travelled", added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed madly grief that it could cause to other people.
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be lots of tears this year", said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, to appeal his conviction.
Tony Blair said that he would capture the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.

When asked if he would like to regain the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it can likely that this happens, so.... »
The head of the Pakistani taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike Friday in Pakistan, was learned from the security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times already in the past.
But officials of the army as well as the activist movement intelligence, said this time he had lost their lives in this strike, carried out in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shooting," a senior security official said.

Mess around the closure of the emergency of the Hôtel-Dieu
Facing the Slingshot led for several months by a part of personnel and several unions, the CGT, Health Minister Marisol Touraine decided July 10 "shift the timing of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which may take place on 4 November".
Officially request "to do run no risk on emergency support in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which was also aimed at does not interfere with the campaign of the PS to months of municipal.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on this date.
Even if to APHP, it prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the emergency room of the Hôtel-Dieu will all received instructions to take the 30 serious cases per day to emergencies other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November is also the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the internal specialized in emergencies will leave place Monday five internal general medicine.
With respect to the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is programmed for the current month.
"Home of the Hôtel-Dieu emergency service must close within the shortest time, and for us, it's November 4", without detour Loïc Capron, president of the medical commission for establishing the APHP (CME), which supports the project.
"November 4, he does there will be more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel Dieu.
"But we will continue to accommodate emergency patients," tempers, arguing the permanent presence of the SMUR vehicles on-site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on-site, also provides.
But it is in the ARS that it belongs to decide the closure of the emergency services.
"Things are done gradually," responds Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS for which, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service."
"The Minister lied to us or has lied to him," deplores the physician Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his post of head of the SMUR early July for having conducted the fronde against the project of reorganization, it defines itself as a "whistleblower" face a "cynical" supported "the technostructure d." decision.
"They are currently empty and asphyxiate emergencies which have been renovated less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there is no problem".
However they are regularly choked.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in emergency Lariboisière.
The ARS, it argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent a "avalanche" in the other emergency services, including the human resources have also been strengthened.
At the ARS for the APHP, it defended the 'new hospital model' already implemented since October 7 and which should continue to accommodate 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal practitioners should also participate in the implementation of "permanence of ambulatory care".
"Where will we if you asked people to self-diagnose", wondered Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of not serious emergency" is "dangerous" and mark "medical regression".
This will happen as with the maternities of level 3.
People are not crazy, they're going to go where there is the best offer care.
If the Minister does not measure by Monday, we are going to change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, physician and member of the CGT health.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think to present a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, Councillor UMP in Paris and elected representative of the 4th district, announced clearly that "Although the Parisian UMP was peacekeeping emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially unable to reopen if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has again recalled Monday morning on France Inter radio that it was pronounced for a moratorium so that there be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, it would mark his net disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable report schema to other hospitals.

François Pope will appoint its first Cardinals in February
François Pope will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest Church men placed in the Church behind the Pope, and those who elect it, so Francis will appoint its first group of men who will eventually choose his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reached the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a Pope - this is therefore equivalent to a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the new, Fr. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all existing Cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
"Pope François decided to communicate its decision to convene the consistory of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the Cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic voices said that by February, the number of Cardinal electors will have probably decreased.
He said that a Pope named generally as many Cardinals that should be to ensure that the number of Cardinal electors reaches 120 and as many Cardinals over age 80 years he wanted.
The consistory of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Francis Pope in March of this year, said Valero.
For the moment, there is a kind of tendency to focus on Europe and in particular the Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope named Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance", he added.
40% of Roman Catholics living in South America, but a small number of Cardinals represent.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world to examine ways of reforming the Church.
Earlier, the Pope decided alone.
«Now, François chose these eight Cardinals so that they help him», said Valero.
He added that it was "quite possible" that François seeks advice on the Cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is totally new.
Valero said that the Popes were in general of bishops representative of large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francois was "full of surprises - so we do not know who he will appoint.

Gérard de Villiers, the author of 'SAS', is dead.
He has never known the word retirement.
Phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died Thursday aged 83, had just published its 200th SAS, "The revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as "the author of novels of espionage who knew too much".
He then had to spend ten days in Afghanistan, theatre of the 198 and 199es installment in the famous series of espionage novels.
Diminished physically by a serious cardiac event in December 2010, it was moving during this trip with a Walker.
And before the Afghanistan, it had also left in Libya, Russia, the Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929, in Paris, was ignoring the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, there are nearly a half a century.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million all countries confused", wore last March.
Her Burmese cat on lap, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building of the avenue Foch two not the Arc de Triomphe, the mischievous look in her white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese, or Korean.
"Besides the pirate editions", he added, designating a stack of books on the coffee table between the bronzes and ivories reported 130 countries surveyed to be novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to traditional coverage with a photo of a young woman in the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or an assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) prince Malko Linge, penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract CIA agent to pay for repairs to the castle of family, launches on the heels of all the wicked of the Earth, Communists in the 1970s and 80, then jihadists from the 1990s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exotic, some hard sex scenes, a dash of violence and torture.
"I have never had claim to be a literary writer," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who wrote to distract people who I send no message.
He worked "as the great reporters of pre-war type Albert Londres, which went on the spot and returned with true and long investigations".
The SAS father said "make a kind of geopolitical drama".
"I am constantly my folders (Afghanistan, Syria,...)" before leaving", said Gérard de Villiers.
On-site, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from services I know for some twenty or thirty years.
Number of its SAS are often prescient: thus, a month before the attack of a centre of command of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The road to Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this town, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, it featured the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar El-Sadat in "Conspiracy of Cairo", one year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported columns of 4 x 4 of jihadists which based on the Malian capital.
I am not clairvoyant, defended himself Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips in often-troubled areas, he moved for a month behind his typewriter IBM marguerite dating from 1976 "whose parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "End" and corrected each page with a pen.
The AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and pictures of the author with African warlords are hung on the walls of his office.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organisations, Gérard de Villiers excluded these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I count very many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko linen, as all heroes, has no age".
He will not die and will leave not retreating.
Not more than I.
