In the mountains schneemangel must hotel owners
Scneelose pisten sorgenn make not only the riesengebirgen-anwohnern.
The lack of snow deterred by the people of appointing skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It is therefore in riesengebirge still free room for all wintertermine incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visit.
The people go the offers, raise the prices, but now they are afraid of binding.
And if you call us immediately, ask whether, in our view, this year's Christmas in snow or "on matsch" will be, led by the operators of the informationsportals spindl.info, Martin jandura.
Who the silvester-aufenthalt in the spindelmühle just after his ideas like that should not have more to do with the appointment hesitate.
Anyone who prefers to save money and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few more days.
The spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer offer now for the silvestertag mostly only wochenaufenthalte.
I think that they are still, for a time, will seek to sell it, but then you also have to give in, and for shorter periods.
And then the free room rapidly dwindling, jandura.
Free beds in all winterterminen always always provides a travel agent in ingtours vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the weihnachtswoche, which have not yet to be sold out.
In our offer is about half the seats still available.
That is why we have been quite a few cheaper weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agencies, Petr schiefert ingtours.
The silvestertag in riesengebirge vrchlabi-reisebüro can also offer yet, but there is much less free seats.
Good cakes also the first 14 days in February and the rest will be sold wintertermine on average.
This year is the interest for the winteraufenthalte negative impact on the fact that, in riesengebirge always no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the pisten verschneit within a week, will also be sold out, says the Christmas schiefert.
Conversely, and a bit better than last year, manages the room in the hotel horizon in pecpod snezkou.
We are around five per cent more than in the previous year.
On silvestertag and Christmas, we have only a few more free rooms.
There is a great deal of interest in the Polish holiday in janua and in February, the business also go well, informed the director of the best pec-hotels, Karel Rada.
To 80 per cent for the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel Omnia in the zentralparkplatz in janske lazne occupied.
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in janske lazne even half the beds free.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we have already been some 60% are filled.
A little weaker is now the February, but, at the moment, if the snow comes, will also increase the interest in the aufenthalten in riesengebirge, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik sporysch.
The wait for a larger schneebescherung riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer now.
On Thursday if it is cool and, if it comes to rain, this should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, is a warming, informed Jiri jakubsky from the site of the Czech wetteramtes in Hradec kralove.
Us: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical how schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue repeatedly, even for the most stupid.
When he finally his gaze longingly awaited afghanistan-doktrin ausschwitzte, it was that he is taking this on the kopierpapier from the busch-irak-szenariovor abschrieb three years.
Not only does it several times in the text itself, the saying goes, "as in Iraq", he has even the name of no one from declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "new vorwärtsweg", without hesitation.
In fact he even three years ago the bush-idee - fresh troop contributions in Iraq troubled by the civil war - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision '.
Subsequent months but showed that the recommendations of the military 'lands the only possible and to that extent very successful was that people today in the news about Iraq no longer.
The reputation of Bush, which has not improved because objectively, he has a much dankbarere reins to his successor hintergelassen than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, hopes Barack Obama insists that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent charged with keeping him again have asked the military, particularly the oberkommandeur the afghanistan-operation general Stanley mccristal, even despite the subordinationsgewohnheiten the zaudernden protect severely criticised in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President was reluctant three months, but with no better idea came, and he has the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has a commitment for another 5,000 pressed, even when he himself with 10,000, at least initially.
Highly problematic about the whole obama-strategie is his plan for the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months to leave, and this process will be completed within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halbierte increase the same effect as the measure will bring in Iraq.
Despite the bruderkrieg of recent years is the irak-gesellschaft relatively well structured, its leaders honours the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation, it can rely on no one, and there are no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, which are accustomed to every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were created formally correct, that leaves only scheinbauten, behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen will make further out.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of a lack of transparency of the conditions that the Pakistan- and iran-einflüsse even more complex.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimum goal of the whole operation is, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of obama-strategie surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the young soldiers in the war cries from the "frühheimkehr" broke out here is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, which is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, the datumssetzung for redeployment pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban, when the indirect confession to the American defeat.
The last NATO Summit showed that the readiness of the Europeans in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians are willing and able to their voters not explain the way in which the security of Germany and Italy, with the war in hindukusch-gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that may influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate, and the increased sanctions on the Iranians not act, the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem will not be solved by troops.
That is the question that must be answered during the period in which America after Obama on siegerabzug from Afghanistan moves on.
Any solution will but also a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only hot packs for Barack Obama, the fact that three years until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time so that it can be applied to a different strategy, fallls those are totalausfall would be no more.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no prämienboni more in cash
The chief executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs this year received no prämienboni more in cash.
The company announced that at the sharp criticism of their lohnpraktiken responded.
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern receives rather than the money in equities, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn in the event when they are too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so in accordance with the agency Reuters at the forefront of the effort, the prämieboni Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street about the wider direction in which you are aware, has led to the former banker of society ', Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the targets for criticism, having for the first three quarters of this year, almost 17 billion dollars for prämienboni had set aside.
The overall size of the prämienboni during this jahra, according to the agency Reuters probably also seems to be a measure today, despite the $20 billion.
The high prämienboni in the banking sector, with the onset of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders the most burning political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, the 25,000 pound exceed, unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.

Each of the winners has the diploma, the nobelmedaile and certification on the purchase of the geldpreises.
The amounts in each category 10 million Swedish kronor.
If there are several winners in each category, the geldpreis under it.

He has in his speech the kontrovere his appointment acknowledged, because it is only at the beginning of his journey, and, moreover, at the head of the country, the two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policies, but he added that wars in certain situations, for the ability of world peace is necessary, even if the price is high.
Janota Minister is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus received on Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard janota, about his would remain within the government, because it reflects on the implementation of the budgets for the next year in the form of this by the abgeordnetenversammlung was released on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget, and perhaps also the retention of janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the freitagstreffens.
The budget will also by Klaus criticised.
According to him, the etatdefizit too high, as well as the crisis in public finances.
On the coincidence informed the präsidentensprecher, radim ochvat.
On its future wants to remain in his role janota on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget-gesetz, which is now Klaus to sign if the Czech Republic, with a deficit of 163 billion kronor economies.
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the linkspartei-vorschläge to geldumwälzung voted the money for the staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of the social services and direktlöhne of farmers.
The government has objected to the suggestions of social democracy, they increase the budget deficit, undercover.
Between the party on the one side and the government, Klaus and rechtspartei, on the other hand, is a severe domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question marks over the future work of the fischer-beamtenkabinetts, on the shaping of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as it was approved by the Parliament, the package of savings virtually wiped out by the fischer- government have been imposed in the autumn, and that after their understanding of the national debt.
Klaus, who is the law on the state reacts can sign, but it must not, said today in the diskussionsfrühstück with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem", the "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, which have been neglected for a long time.
Today, in his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only a strong government, which would lead to a broader consensus among the political parties could build.
The ods-vorsitzende, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ods-stellvorsitzende, Petr necas, said the ctk that the concept of beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD and ODS and grünenpartei clearly no longer works.
Premier fishermen called in the drafting similar words as "strong worry".
The cssd-chef, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the topolanek-worte that the etatdefizit horrifying is that the previous administration of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday rated CSSD the approval of the budgets for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by clint Eastwood played by Morgan freeman
The South Africans claim that the new hollywood-film "invictus: the ungeschlagene" in the world shows that much of the country from its fight and win despite some criticisms that the starring role was filled by an American actor.
The story of sport, rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid-regierungssystem in the South African Republic, as well as their first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his personal history of the American oscar-schauspieler, Morgan freeman.
Freeman said that he was of the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could represent him in eastwood- film.
A further significant role little Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I will take them.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, of the price for his role in the eastwood-drama from the boxbereich "million dollar baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has been done by slave owners, finally, to a fictional usa-präsidenten God, and also in "Evan omnipotent", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischestaatsmann was for his active career in the end of apartheid in South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was in 1990 to set free undfür four years he has been President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time it is the name of a gedichtes of the English author William Ernest henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement, as he was to speak
The film recounts the true story of Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugbyteams, Francois pienaar, zusammenschloss to some of the country's new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically divided.
He believes that he has his people through sport to agree, so he decides, one of the world rugbyspieler who are outsiders to some.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years, the mandela-geschichte on the kinoleinwand.
He had no objective other than to play that role at this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said freeman.
The greatest challenge, of course, was, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said that if he and the leaders in the same country would be, he would try to meet with Mandela night with him to eat and, in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela.
I have noticed that when I say, I am pleased schüttele the hands of their energy, they will, and I had the feeling that I know what they are feeling, he said.
For me, it is important to have become a different person.
Little Damon is in the film François pienaar, the captain of the national rugbyteams, when White players have prevailed.
The actor said that he was six months had time for his role in the harsh rugbywelt.
It was a great surprise for him, pienaar, when he met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I think of the türklingel rang that he opened up and the first thing I have to François pienaar, said in my life was: 'in the film, I see a lot more'.
Despite the apparent differences in the stature of the actors, compared with their actual role models, he has led by the director Eastwood, "invictus: ungeschlagen" positive reviews, and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The filmkritiker took charge of the paper's daily variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "that was very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the filmrezensionen on the web-seiten rottentomatoes.com, has invictus 76 percent positive assessments.
Lichtgeheimnis on Norway dissolved, the Russians have tested a missile
On Norway was a special lichteffekt of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has admitted that as recently as yesterday, near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But again the launch was not successful and as a type "bulava missile, which was originally called" the pride of the Russian army should be, is beginning to the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also, his presence on the ground in the raketetest had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge.
Bulava is, in most cases not at all started or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian media do you already on "bulava" than on a "missile, which does not flies."
A missile, which is not flies, but
This has already been 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Until the end of the journey, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third raketenstufe.
This time, "bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry donskij, which under the waters of the White Sea was driving.
This raketentyp allows the launch of the submarine.
It is therefore likely that fliegendes object caused by an indeterminate mysterious light on nordwegen indeed the damaged "bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment no doubt that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals, however, kept diesesmal and claimed that it was not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were not enough and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage damaged.
Even if no teststart without mistake, he is still in charge of the defence ministry, only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost fünfzigprozentige success met with optimism and therefore the generals will continue to claim that the "bulava" even without problems will fly and even to ten hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with a gesamtgewicht of Max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary fetisov has a jahresvertrag with 51 years with the cska Moscow signed
The legendary abwehrspieler vjaceslav fetisov, with 51 years, in a profi-eishockeyspiel.
The former world champion, Olympic and Stanley Cup -inhaber helps his team cska Moscow in the distress, and is probably already in the freitagsduel khl against Petersburg.
Fetisov, his career with forty years ago, in 1998, has been completed, is currently President of the cska.
After Denis kuljas injured, we urgently need a further abwehrspieler.
Fetisov has regularly Frenchman and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need some rest of formalities, quoted the Agency to clarify the coach of the moskauclubs AP by Sergei nemcinov.
Now, it is not clear whether the revival of the famous eishockeyspielers just a game.
I think that this is a fetisov, which can raise the morale of other players, led to nemcinov players.
If fetisov back to the eisfläche comes after AP, he will be the oldest Russian professional eishockeyspiel.
In the nhl, the legendary strikers such gordie Howe with fifty-one years played an entire season for hartford, and was able to 15 hits and 26 assistenzen zuguteschreiben.
The oldest of the famous five, fetisov, kasatonov - Makarov, larionov, krutov, is one of the best and most successful eishockeyspieler in history.

In the second part of his career he collected success in the nhl, where he detroit-dress twice the Stanley Cup on the head.
Since 2001, he is a Member of the eishockey-sternzimmers.

The Board of the nosovice-automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the trade union to lifting of all overtime.
Because often angeordneter overtime, the Union announced on Monday the streikbereitschaft.
This confirmed the spokesman for the automobilfabrik Hyundai, Petr vanek.
The Board will but with the trade unionists, even on a samstagsschicht some this week.
We must not abandon our fertigungsplan, which is a principle that was therefore on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime for the reason that two arbeitsschichten proposed would be done vanek said.

Czech discovery: a substance, which also works on Anglo-Saxon gestählten ´ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds the spread of HIV viruses in the body to prevent.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact, against the disadvantage that the connection to normal virus-varianten not as strong, as one of the existing medicines.
The AIDS cannot yet be cured.
The patients can the medikamentenzusammenstellung but life in length and the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
Their use, but of a whole range of side-effects.
Incomplete oppression of virus-vermehrung also has the development. Resistentviren SG, against the no drugs more effectively.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences, cr by the vscht (chemisch-technologische seminary) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way how to deal with the virus-resistenz.
They have proven that the substances known as metalokarborane on the eiweißstoff act, which is responsible for the hiv-viruses.
The metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds, the virus-vermehrung in a different way than all drugs used today, so that you can overcome resistenz-problem.
In their work to get the scientists to new ´ improved ´ compounds, based on the knowledge of the molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viren-eiweißstoff were being prepared.
The metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from bor-, hydrogen technology and kohlenstoff-atomen and by a metall-atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and maintainable virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of the HIV virus, for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the hiv-virus-spaltung caused by the hiv-protease infektionsvirenpartikel would cause no tyres.
If we switch off the hiv-protease do we shift the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the scientists explain in the press release, the Institute for organic chemistry and green chemicals of the Academy of Sciences cr was issued.
In the paper published in the journal of medicinal chemistry wissenschaftszeitung was published describe the scientists whole ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then systematically further is changed.
A little weaker, but reliable
The effect of this number of substances against the hiv-protease mark tested in wurdne, even against their steady (resistant) variations that of HIV-infected patients.
The impact of the metalokarborane in the usual enzym-variante is not as strong, as in the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effects on the resistentvarianten, against the use of drugs are often ineffective.
The unique wirkungsmechanismus and its characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low, were aware of and opportunities of other chemical lie, makes the metalokarboranen to interesting compounds for further to the development of effective medicines to combat HIV racial research, says pavlina rezacova, head of the laboratory for strukturbiologie the Institute is for organic chemistry and green chemicals and for the institute is in molecular genetics is of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the literalist
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, has called the approved budget for the next year as "horrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, in his opinion, should consider their continued existence.
The statement from the Czech ODS called the Prime Minister as "strong worry".
It is supposedly time for the analysis.
The Deputy ods-vorsitzende, Petr necas, said that the concept of beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD and ODS and grünenpartei clearly no longer works.
After necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to look at the minority in Parliament to prop up when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to ultra-conservative necas.
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has objected to the suggestions of social democracy, they increase the budget deficit, undercover.
The Czech Republic should with a backlog of 163 billion kronor economies.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of budgetprovisoriums frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard janota, about his frustration and a sense of futility, while premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government the present situation is assessed.
Necas is convinced that if janota serious about his resignation, in case they would have threatened that the abänderungsvorschläge were to be adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television has janota for Monday after the regierungsgeschäft in the premier.
In fact he indicated that he also be to remain in office.
So is his disappointment at the verhandugn of budget.
The fishermen on the continuing battle with the budget-defizit have necas, according to the nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget had prevailed in the government to do nothing.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament will continue to defizit-steigernde laws, for example, the sickness pay and pensions are or the dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek, the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
That is the job of the Prime Minister, fishermen and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made mistakes, has Topolanek in a textmeldung from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people sit on top 09 profess voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decides in favour, on the fight against the defizit-höhe of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the linksmehrheit currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance, not the need for it.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be up to date, then I will look into this matter, said the Civil Democratic Party nominee Defence Minister Martin bartak the journalists in Parliament.
Premier fishermen flew afternoon at the European Council meeting in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister, back
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the premier Members would explicitly ask the need for the adoption of the budget.
We will not be an orphan, we are no small children, as he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament, as well as in the Czech Republic was not reduced.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
Even when I gave to the mandate, I knew that, in coming months, especially at bolschewisierung of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive would fail, reacted Topolanek itself.
After the new road map of records (Czech railways) will be fewer trains travel for roughly the same fahrpreis.
The Czech railways closed or restricted from 13 December some less will be closing its schnell- and lokalzüge, other links are reinforced.
The whole verkehrsumfang will from the gültigkeitstag of new roadmap, compared with today at two per cent.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several verbindungsmöglichkeiten received in the capital, for example, the residents of ostrava-gebiets, the railways is on the line trains the type pendolino.
The by express train will no longer after Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less schnellzüge will also be on the line Prague - pisek travel, budweis, in principle, the direct connections of Prague after letohrad reduced.
The biggest reduction does the railways in the county of Hradec kralove (königsgraz), a total of about eight percent, on a rise in May, on the other hand, Prague and surrounding areas.
Two nachtzüge also be lifted on the Prague - tabor - budweis and on some days in the week, the operation of some schnellzüge on the line Prague - pisek - budweis reduced.
One of the biggest changes include the introduction of the new direktverkehrsweges from milovice after Prague, now have the inhabitants of milovice in lysa nad Labem switch.
It is the 15th route of vorortverkehrsystems Esko, whose opening thanks to the eisenbahnelektrifizierung from lysa nad Labem after milovice is possible.
The fernlangstrecken in the capital will be in the zielstation Prague - hauptbahnhof end.
The CD introduces more lines sc pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after sumperk / jesenik in the space of two hours.
With the pendolino users can no longer since 13 December after Bratislava.
This year's bill for regionaleisenbahn: increase of 200 million
The schnellzüge are appointed and paid by the Ministry of Transport, a total of receives the railways to reimburse the so-called liquiditätsverlusts in the next year four billion kronor, as this year. Genaus the lokalzüge providing districts, overall, they have to pay for that in the next year eight billion kronor, with the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regionalzüge 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the lokalzüge and the schnellzüge has the railways a zehnjahresvertrag newly completed, until now the Treaty was only ever for a year.
The railways praises the system, therefore, it has also perhaps not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of the tickets to passengers.
To changes, it is only in one-day netzfahrscheinen CD net and favourable internetfahrscheinen eliska.

Jancura makes for libel complaint against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, radim jancura today, makes for libel complaint against three sozial-demokratische leaders.
Against Michal hasek from the district südmähren, Radko Martinek from the district pardubice and the head of the region, Martin tesarik olomouc.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen inteview in radiojournal.
The complaint has to do with the effort of the company, the regionalzugverkehr in some districts.
All regions, but will have the long-term contracts signed with the Czech railways.
All three heads are attacking us and say that we have the pick, in so doing, we have taken the offer just the volume, it was agreed with them.
They claim that we expensive than the Czech railways are, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, which would have been completed last week.
So, we have no choice but to us to fight back.
Because of this slander of the society student agency, said jancura the radiojournal.
At the same time he gave was that he evidence from all districts that it takes their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection of the complaint for further continuation of the medialshow of jancura it as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course I am prepared my good name and the reputation of my region to defend, and I would urge other head on.

The campaign has initiated jancura after the districts at the behest of the regionaleisenbahnverkehrs agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a high level of about 150 billion kronor no contracts were put out to tender.
After vancura such behaviour is illegal and inconsistent with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts, according to jancura threatened, already a Member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we do that we can lose buslizenzen.
It turned out to be a Member of the CSSD before, I know, who, I am not saying his name, said the radiojournal jancura today.
Vaccination against pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families free and voluntary.
But now is to declare that the vote would be more effective pflicht-impfung.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate.
The arzneiinstitut already set the maximum price of vaccines that the insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also on the impfungsverfahren aware.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free august-kinder
From January children can be vaccinated against free pneumokokken on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they would not have received impfdosis.
With the vaccine already in last year or earlier weiterewiederholungsimpfung began, must also pay themselves.
The first impfdosis must between 3 and 5 month of life of the child will be given.
Already last year, a quarter of the families against pneumokokken vaccinate their children.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
On the whole, the experts that the insurance companies for the quantities 300,000 to 450,000 Crowns per year.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all flächenimpfungen of children around 500,000 per year.
The pflicht-impfung with the so-called janota-paket was introduced.
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the pflicht-impfung of children against pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
The vaccine will be mandatory?
At the same time it is said that these vaccination in the future could be mandatory.
From January this by insurance paid for and be voluntary.
The pflicht-impfung would be better mentioned, for example, the head of the bürgervereinigung nahlas, Rudolf kalovsky.
His association is already in the long term for the pneumokokken-impfung.
The experts at the international conference, which was involved in our Union, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not an ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to at least push this through.
I believe that this is the road that we have to go now, kalovsky.
The Department of Health wants but the impfverfahren against pneumokokken not change.
At the moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman vlastimil sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the fachgesellschaft of practical kinderärzten, Hana cabrnochova, agrees that there is a voluntary vaccination their disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could then be on the reduction of wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive it is, we have come to understand the political decision that it was launched as a voluntary vaccination," says allerdingst cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80% of parents their infants against pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
The vaccination against pneumokokken is a breakthrough that these were the first flächenimpfung is paid for by the insurance companies, not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, in order to save them for further treatment, erkärt cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
So that is a concern of the practical kinderärzte that the purchase of the vaccines.
After the initial project of the vaccines should be used by the insurance companies and doctors these then received the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to you.
Some Members feared but that the insurance so "the money from the krankenversicherungherausführen could".
Therefore, the doctors themselves and buy the vaccines have to wait for the insurance companies to pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors per month 40,000 kroner to invest, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says cabrnochova.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a bauverbot voted for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John bowen, an American academics, a thorough and thoughtful report saying whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten can be integrated into European societies – and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author, "why the French No headscarves love" (originaltitel: "why the French don ’ t like headscarves") (2006), an elegant and dense argumentierenden study is a contentious issue, which is the country more than one and a half decades, and employees and their effects are visible today.
Bowens neustes book provides a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologe he would not only know what the politicians and the media about Islam say in France, but what is really happening in the area.
He has months in mosques, schools and colleges, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it bowen calls "Islamic free" offer.
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a city hall in opposition marry (or both)?
Should young Muslims over evolution and rights of homosexuals deal?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
It is for a Muslim, is allowed to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is this seemingly more down-to-earth matters, he argues, represent the daily life, unlike the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of tarik Ramadan, one in Switzerland, born Arab / Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have not all arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, bowen respondents, are often at odds with their salafi-gegenstücken – supporters of puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia, which nowadays is a small but influential presence in Europe ’ s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
He queries whether French political leaders (and the intellectual elite, who have suffered so passionate the separation of church and state is to guard) really pluralism committed.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rauere treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn their historical compromise with the secular republicanism had to make.
He acknowledges more of a "tightening up the werteschrauben" as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet".

The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the us-behörde for international development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte of lobbying by the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban right a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the charge of 'risk' can be arrested.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include an easy protests and critical writings, suggest a verhaftungsrisiko.
Anti-government graffiti and statements will be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger-gemeinschaft by the popular reporter yoani Sánchez, who frequently describes how she and her husband followed and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of the American contractors will probably tensions between the Communist government of the castro-bruders in Cuba and Obama administrations, which increase a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was first freitagnacht of the New York Times reported.
The new US policy is to ensure that the United States will provide a contribution if the Cuban Government to take concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legally in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government officials $15 per month.
The Cuban Government has allowed this year the purchase of a mobile phone for ordinary citizens, they will be but for the fact that text messages are used as a 15-minütiges phone call a daily wage would cost.
The use of the Internet is on the island of extremely limited.

Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention is clearly wrong.
An activity that in each other free society - which would be legally free to make mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel vivanco, Director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, "who recently received a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, entitled" new Castro, the same Cuba "herausbrachte, an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel.

Pakistani government officials blankets plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from nord-virginia to Afghanistan in order to send troops to kill, and said that they hope that this case could help reveal an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies who use the Internet to find out after radicalised young men.
Detectives said that they are an opaque insurgents, known as saifullah, had sought, of the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had identified, because one of them on the internet-videoseite YouTube favourable comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after their arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of the men and tried to help them remote area in Pakistan's stammesgürtel, the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, saifullah, the al-kaida-führer not convinced that the men are not part of a cia-verschwörung to subvert the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the North West, which has become a terroristenzufluchtsstätte.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and tried, and continue to make the right recommendations to obtain access to the al-kaida-lagern, when they were arrested by the Pakistani strafvollzugsbehörden.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and questioned by the FBI, highlights the pivotal role of recruitment agencies in the identification of future terrorists, and possibly even more important, the decision as to who is to be trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the us-geheimdienst to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The recruitment agencies of the organisation as pförtner, those not let, whose commitment to the holy war not seriously enough and those who could be spies.
American möchtegern-rekruten will of a Qaeda a particular scrutiny, analysts said.
Because of their potential access to us-zielen and its propagandawertes you will but also as a hugely attractive to the group.
Evan kohlmann, Chief Secretary analysts of nefa-foundation with headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups in the last few years has become much more cautious in terms of whom they may, because the US intelligence services are experts of their rekrutierungsmethoden.
If you are trying to slip someone in these groups, what better way could you go as the rekrutierungsmodell to follow, which so many already have followed?, said kohlmann.
The model is based much more on the Internet.

On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with transparent through the city, which was in English, "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the birth of their mother, their awareness of what herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to take part in the major demonstration - at the floor pass and the world leader to appeal to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way that the question of herumführt.
The police, the demonstrators from getting too close to the bella-zentrum and said that they have 19 people were arrested, mainly due to the fact that they were or taschenmesser mitführten masquerading either.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations banned.
According to a spectator, not to be named because he is involved in the negotiations on climate change, zündeten disguised demonstrators in black clothing several ordnance in the vicinity of the Copenhagen hauptkanals, in its vicinity, various ministries.

He was then in Mandarin and said: "because there is a large, I can not hear what is happening outside".
He stated that it from the perspective of individual hillsides whether the demonstration damage or would help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that the negotiations or the freedom of other people disturb."
Prüfungsdaten show stubborn rassenkluft
The certificates to mathematikleistung were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district Washington still far behind the schools of the country, the excellence, show the certificates that the viert- and achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York as well.
But what in the latest figures from the national evaluation of the bildungsfortschritts (national assessment of educational progress, naep) is included, is the stubborn leistungskluft between African-American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average sum total of white viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 on 270 (on a scale of 500) of their African-American their peers, but only three points from 209 at 212.
In reality, the leistungskluft rose between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically vernachlässigbaren point of 245 to 244.
The average sum total of white pupils was not included in the test data, since the stichprobenumfang was not big enough.
The picture of a six-year period, is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first naep was covered in this district, 60 skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the sum total, the children of both groups have achieved in that time, has built up the difference with now 58 points scarcely decreased.
Some bildungsbefürworter of distrikts last week expressed their concern that the results of schulkanzlerin Michelle A. rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. fenty were celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, who are already high-achieving children were taken.
This suggests that we have the gesamtwertung by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, have raised what problematic and is difficult, said Jeff Smith, a Member of the board of D.C. voice, a non-profit group that bildungsgleichheit in Washington D. C..
I springe not for a range of two or three points and knelt, said the democratic Washington stadtratsmitglied, Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of eaton-grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critic of the managementstils of rhee, said that the message of prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city in need of urgent attention.
Of course we would like to see the positive signs, which I respect.
But what I fear is that we will not spend the time and energy that we would have to commit to our mittelschule.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways of meeting the needs of leistungsschwachen pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained, a new leselehrplan that wilson-lese-system to use, which is based on pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and mittelschule the basic skills of reading aimed not at the beginning of their schullaufbahn and which have been significantly short of their peer groups klassenkameraden behind.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten training to sixth class games and lebensechte experiences in the centre stage, was under the former chief schulinspektor clifford janey after Washington this curriculum and some of the naep-fortschritte, the last week, have been reported.
I believe that we still need to work to the best measures for the pupils to allow them to benefit from the notenniveau, rhee said.
Others say that the naep-ergebnisse highlight the question of whether rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to play the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools can provide the necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle rhee, said Bruce fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, the urban audit findings.
The conventional medicine is his resources and management reforms at the schools is in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions against this important item on the agenda.
The downside is of course that, as with other urban schulinspektoren that it is trying, the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the communities so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who now schulinspektor in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft is that the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to renew in order to compete with the charter-schulen.
We need the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the strength to change, said janey, with his teachers' last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a major increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than prospects
The coach the gettysburg-college with a noisy home.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising and blinzelt a moment at the sight of white pillars, ziegelsteinfassaden and the smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have highschool in El Salvador.
Until recently, because graciela had also been recovered in silver spring and is now living in riverdale never set foot in a college-campus.
Their position and that of the other achtklässler of the group, the gettysburg explore, where the teaching per year costs $38.690 was more ehrfurchtsvollen besuchers, than that of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called graciela to study medicine would, when the leaders declared that they had to enter the building for the natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said food for thought, as the low professor-zu-studenten-verhältnis school reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children on their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message included in full: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States the highschool hispanischer immigrants, not an end, or pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, which receive collegeausbildung that is needed in the middle class levels.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of hispanoamerikaner the College – which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the US came to concluded without the highschool.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which has a huge role to play in the workforce of the country, will show the way forward.
Those who high-achieving children, say, these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent drive to success.
Many of them have also parents who give their children high goals and find ways to their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But beratungsprogramme also play a large role by graciela and millions of children as they help in college, especially if these efforts will continue for long periods of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to wegsuche to help through the system, then it will, at some time or a single measure, not solve the problem, said Patricia gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, which examined hispanoamerikanische students.
We have to think about it, for these children a network of pre-school and supported by the highschool.
The bundesprogramm gracielas college-tour had funded, which is a useful example.
It is known as gear up - get a hochschalten - and is more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems are available, in order to launch, the start college-vorbereitungsprogramme if low-income pupils in the mittelschule are and will continue until they have completed the highschool.
According to the us-department for education, the programme since 1999, more than 10 million pupils helped, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies from
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government in two on Saturday completed auctions major oil companies could get his victims to rebuild infrastructure.
The 10 with foreign oil companies signed contracts for the Iraqi ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only shares in two of the 10 versteigerten of fields.
Seven American companies had to participate in the second auction, paid on Friday.
The only company that has made a requirement has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have contracts for in June versteigerte fields.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of Iraqi oil industry, analysts by surprise.
Iraq has at long last, after six years of war and opened its doors instead of us give Asian and European leading the way, said ruba husari, the editor of Iraq oil forum, a online-nachrichtendienst.
There will be no other offers in Iraq.
Safety concerns, even by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and the political instability have been underlined by the withdrawal of us have probably have been stopped by American oil companies, more analysts, said to be engaged in Iraq, the third-largest proven rohölreserven of the world.
In some cases, were US companies at a disadvantage, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled companies that have significantly lower wage costs, and more likely to take risks, because it is not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-mobil and exploration by Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, the contracts with the Ministry conclusion.
Major US companies Chevron and conocophillips, as with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were two of the main protagonists in this weekend conferred upon contracts.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, for more contracts that than any other company and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the Speaker of the ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China on the road, one of the major economy, as well as a technologiemacht.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its mitbietern measure and can meet its obligations in relation to Iraq.
For the gebotsabgabe vorausgewählte companies gave Commandments, what then with the fee per barrel of oil were compared, the Ministry was willing to pay the equivalent of every felds on the current level.
Top-planer of Al Qaeda in Pakistan killed
In an apparent us-raketenangriff along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is a top-einsatzplaner this week Al Qaeda be killed, representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung reported on Friday.
This would be, if it were true, the second deadly attack on a high leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al-somali was one of the two Arabs, who in accordance with United States sources and Pakistani behördenvertretern the region of a number of missiles should be killed on Tuesday their car near the city of miran Shah in the province of nord-waziristan met.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drohnentyp by the CIA in the lawless stammesgürtel Pakistan's being used.
They were in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was made, said a civic leaders of a Pakistani civil service from miran Shah by telephone.
Local suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the tracks and were quickly everything to itself, which had been destroyed by the "fully was left" bodies.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung led unspecified evidence that claimed belonged to the dead.
Claimed was as the top military planners of Al Qaeda, described the operations of terrorist groups outside the region Afghanistan-Pakistan.
He was working on plots around the world, said a senior official, who wanted to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the American air raids on Pakistani soil.
If his central role taken for granted, contained the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was strategic directives from the topführern of Al Qaeda and did in operationsplanungen for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American civic leaders said that claimed quickly in the al-kaida-hierarchie was reached and the best of links to other extremists groups cooperated in the region.
It may not be aware of some Americans, said the second civic leaders, but this does not reduce the threat he was for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be claimed the second leading Al kaida- or talibanführer since September, was killed in a similar attack najmuddin jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the stammesgebiet and three other topaktivisten were killed.
The pace of attacks by unmanned air vehicles for the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the long was journal, one of a non-profit organisation unterhaltenen website, from an average of six operations per month on two dropped.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time on suspected informants who brutally killed, according to the side.
From having been a United Nations delegate in Kabul will resign
The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he resign from his post in March, which will end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election, sponsored by the United Nations has been tarnished.
Oath as the Obama administrations, we have decided to go further 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the truppenerhöhung, but he also expressed his concerns about the us-zeitplan for the military withdrawal, which is due to start in 18 months, other nato-regierungen could lead to withdraw its forces.
We need to build the Afghan security forces and thereby accelerate the right signal to the Afghan people that the international community can trust, said Eide in a telefoninterview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, the number of international civilian aid workers to increase in the political changeover Afghanistan's supposed to help.
The truppenerhöhung on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he was not quits, but only one in March 2008, his family to grant agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that they have time for a replacement.
What I said was that it is better to seek a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the are my predecessor and I arrived.
Ban, in accordance with un-vertretern with the search for a replacement has begun.
The UN officials say that he schwedisch-italienisch-stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the United Nations mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the previously led un-friedensoperationen, has considered.
Oath position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to prefer to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the allegations, but he also said that the accusations made by Galbraith - who was fired, "the mission has undoubtedly harmed, because there is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference with the election was".
Eide said that the appointment of a senior civilian representative has recommended to the assistance of the American's armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the drive un-führung his successor, allowed more staff from the United States and other Western countries for the Afghan mission donations, and said that this would strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the circuitous un-einstellungsregelungen have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The un-regeln are designed in such a way that I have been a Member since May, he said, only one person has been able to adapt.
This is a disaster and must not continue.
Defense Secretary gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because it does not impose in talks on his atompläne has participated.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen trip by the kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of about 300 troops in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran down.
In Iran, there are no good options for election, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the things my soul, is, if we, in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administrations prefers a sanktionspaket recital, which is based on the military and political elite of Iran, but gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the durchschnittsiraner.
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" is required "in order to convince the Iranian Government that it has nuclear weapons, is protected", because "monsters' of their people are suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the spokesman for the White House, Robert gibbs, the American Government, the European leaders in warning that the Iran with "credible" consequences if he must reckon with its nuclear programme is not the demands of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October said of Iran that he talks to curb its nuclear programme would resume, and an essential part of their lagerbestands of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuklearbrennstoff for its medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran but appears since then the negotiations have to leave the preliminary agreement, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether it should commit to the United States.
Iran the international community in relation to a number of proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, are simply that, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as it brought in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran have never been, said gates.
President Obama has 31 dez. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before he had other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions", will continue.
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations on Thursday, which they condemned as "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of certain members of the Iranian atomaktivitäten called and said that they are willing to the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, on the last Friday to return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he joined the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish behördenvertretern flew in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq is still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the division of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to the conflict to be reduced in order to delay the us-pläne to prevent the American troops by the end of August of 115 000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. Us-vertreter quoted gates of masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will their security, prosperity and their autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang weijia and her husband, surrounded by propagandaplakaten to lecture them, 'the mother earth is too tired to have further children "and" one more baby means one more graves ".
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, all of a sudden, began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "under no circumstances".
We already have all our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing more to be said Wang, 31, a personalleiterin with a 8-monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled the einzelkindern affectionately as "little emperor", will be named, has produced a bevölkerungskrise in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN has fallen
Department on demography, while the number of people of 60 years of age and older in the year 2020 16.7 per cent of the population by the year 2050 to 31,1 percent rocket is so far above the global average of around 20%.
This imbalance is in rich coastal with better educated population, like Shanghai, stronger.
Last year have 60-jährige and older almost 22 percent of reported residents identified Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie lingli, head of the Shanghai stadtbevölkerungs- and familienplanungskomission said that couples of reproductive age should receive babies, in order to help "the relationship of the ageing bevölkerungsanteile and labour shortages to alleviate the future".
Shanghai will soon be "so old, but not so rich, as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual easing
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy, probably the most controversial is likely to be provided by the ruling Communist Party, until now, has been introduced.
Couples now against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese staatsvertreter have attributed to this policy, that the critical financial pressure on the natural landesressourcen could be avoided, whereas human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned.
In rural areas have some officials pregnant women, who already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples had also geschlechtsselektive abortions, which will carry out an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, officials for population gradual their position on the one-child policy weakened.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and the number of cases in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder -- and 2007 has been the tone of many hard slogans watered down.
Qiao xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for bevölkerungsforschung Beijing University said that government officials recently discussed even on more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, in which a partner einzelkind.
Shanghai was in July on the first Chinese city, which is an aggressive campaign to promote more births has launched.
Posters, the families belehrten, only to have a child, were almost overnight of directives, describe in detail for a second child who is and how they can apply for permission.
The town hall, municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, couples sent home to go and informationsblätter durchzuschieben under the doors.
They also asked about psychological and financial advice to be made available to the more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said familienplanungsvertreter.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural town in the außenbereichen of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to see which, following the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported against any change.
In the municipality huinan with a population of 115 000 are still per month, for example, only four or five requests.
Unrequited Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165.000 will lie -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng juying, head of the Shanghai municipality familienplanungskomitees caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give the best that its first, she said.
Yang jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and that that is legally allowed.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a slight sickness and life insurance to the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West do the one-child policy as the issue of human rights, said Yang, an engineer, whose woman in the seventh month is pregnant with their first child.
Yes, it is robbing us with the opportunity to more than to have a child.
The problem, however, lies not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples are psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personalleiterin, said she would like to just one child, because she was also a einzelkind. "we were at the centre of the family and used that each of us to.
We are not accustomed to worrying about others and want to take care of this, not really. "
Chen zijian, a 42-jähriger, a übersetzungsunternehmen outspoken heard it said.
For parents from the middle class with doppelkarriere, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, is a matter to be successful and one has to be selfish.
Today, the age of 20 to 39-jährigen of their parents grew during the early days of the Chinese kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see such a life for themselves in any way, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother, your social life for at least two years.
Then there is the raumfrage -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the limited -- "if the child 9 months old, is already a CV for the best nurseries foresee."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time durchzumachen, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first, which has reached a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
Uno-gruppe sketches plan to reduce emissions
Funded by the UN conference on climate change, which up to now by Wilde postures, and recrimination, was emphasized during -- has on Friday with the publication of a document, another priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with the industrialised nations in the near future have to bear the greatest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, could provide both the remaining obstacles to their exchange rates, as well as the way forward.
But it was an important step forward in a negotiation, of the time, as next week more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special UN working group has been formulated, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term, so that they can deal with global warming.
It also provides a range of options for the key questions, including how advanced and big emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how much of the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the policymakers.
The process will be a great deal of flexibility, so John coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra club in Washington.
Michael Zammit cutajar, of the six pages document, has drafted a 180 pages long verhandlungstext, so the focus on what the leading klimaschutzvertreter the UN, yvo, Mr de Boer, as "the big picture.
It shows the plans for a possible agreement, in which the industrialised nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions in the same period of between 15% and 30% would be reduced.
Together countries could increase emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95%.
The European Community has the talks on Friday and given a boost by her confirmation, over the next three years 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of the floods and drought and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, yet the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week had intended.
The American klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern has provisions, which rejected binding reductions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary reductions by major emerging economies, calling for, if these do not have to be funded by the industrialised nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administrations take a stronger line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, less than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging economies stand up and take action, also sued the Stern, that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions also could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern was his opinion after an hour of the statement by the Chinese vizeaußenministers he yafei, said that the leading American klimaunterhändler either to "the common sense" or feels it "highly irresponsible" of him that he was the beginning of the week said that the United States would help China not financially, global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers that are at stake, both within the industrialised nations, as well as between the industrialised and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States, because of their commitments squabbles, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen influential countries ignoring the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers who are fighting the cost of the bremsung of treibhausgasausstoßes should wear, because even the affected countries have begun to take action, aggressive in the countries with very high treibhausgasabgabe for their actions accountable.
This is clearly a game, which will develop a new economic domination, ulate, also as a regional klimawandelberater for conservation international in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the impact of climate change, said that they continue to a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, although the leading participants say that the talks in the best case scenario will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning 24-seitigen submitted a draft Treaty.
Artur runge-metzger, the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states, "political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they now are united and measures by emerging economies such as China and India have been calling for.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding questions before the arrival of the regierungsführer must be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
High Representative, as the Indian Environment Minister jairam ramesh and the Chinese vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and they take rest breaks through the corridors of bella-centers to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to chart claims during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13,000 people go in every day, and a kongresszentrum gitarrespielende activists Sunday night shows, where they are on the countries make a joke, betrayed and sell their opinion, and draft by hand in hand, rather than be sent an e-mail passed — is already a challenge.
The intensity builds are just eye: almost all the important ministers are here now and, from Wednesday, 60 regierungsführer in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for global policy of the organization conservation international.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h quicker train defines the montagsgefühl newly
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 is a tune to penetrate the darkness announce a zugabfahrt a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country, with blitzfahrt of ashfort, Kent, after London St pancras 225 km / h, and 93 kilometres in 38 minutes to go.
To Lord adonis, the transport minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first javelin-pendlerservices from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain, finally, to an international network quicker, more reliable trains ankoppeln will and the large areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland, ending in London.
The neglected province could to living pendlerstädten arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would be radically reduced the change of plane and car to railways would the national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, do the big three parties in this vision.
But the British pound, for the construction of a new national networks are needed, the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about damage to the United Kingdom could still hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen start applying the brakes.
High speed two (hs2), a company based in January, which the government is due to present a feasibility study will lord adonis according to the times report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed streckenkarte the next planned stage of the hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new railway line, the London with the West Midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places with regard, where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site, the plan the concept within a gap of 25 metres from the final stretch.
Hs2 will also have three options for a major, hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetz leading northwards.
Lord adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham parts and a abzweig would west of the pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction north-east after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"it appears the most viable option," said a eisenbahn-insider.
After the completion would the tourist season between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which is not in 2025 would be opened to travellers, it would allow the route london-birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a little over an hour to go.
The proposals, in fact, the outlines of the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km / h, which the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximalkapazität of 1 000 people to be able to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the route could london-birmingham be in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be necessary, on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be it.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to the high-speed network.
Bahnexperten say that only St pancras international or euston this potential.
Lord adonis will be known whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he set the wheels in motion, must be built in sections of the rail network.
The trains, first by the high-speed lines on existing the railway tracks in the north of Birmingham change the tourist season, which continues to rotate between London and Scotland would be about three hours.
This is a key sticking point, so that a change from the plane to the railways can be a beacon for the schienenrevolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgage for a Conservative to pfund-orangerie 75,000
Alan Duncan, the leading unterhausmitglied of the Conservatives, has the taxpayers per year thousands of pounds towards the cost of a Orangerie in it in his house in his constituency are deported.
The gefängnissprecher of the Party, David Cameron has been downgraded, because he complained about that unterhausmitglieder "of poor rationen" life has £75,000 in order to increase his mortgage in order to be in a eichenholz-fachwerkanbau zweithaus building in Rutland.
It was the taxpayers that additional zinsaufkommen to take into account, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons, the proposals were approved and they were also of Sir Thomas legg not called into question, of a review of the expenses of unterhausmitglieder. Last night said Duncan, that the amendments "not even cleaner or more can be".
Duncan, one of the richest unterhausmitglieder, has a zweistöckiges House in a village in his constituency of Rutland and melton.
The houses in the vicinity have a sale price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and esszimmer, but the fees office, a ausgabenkontrollstelle of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan more space needs.
Last year, he has produced a wintergarten in the plans as "Orangerie '.
Neighbours described him as a "glass house for entertainment".

It is quite clear that it is a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) a little too close to call, said Mr Camus.
The grouping UDF (Union for French Democracy), energetic and calls for the party to centre to no longer using their seals
The grouping of François Bayrou ’ s Party modem is monitored, on Friday has a tentative takeover of the label, which once did has been replaced by Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing formed Party, on the part of the chairman of the Party to centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and under threat of judicial persecution invited to this stamp on a document more.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this udf-siegel, because he believes that is not worthy of François Bayrou, would this political legacy to defend, after he left the extended a hand.
The Defence Minister, whose parteipartner the UMP is, in fact, wanted to this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
The emphasis of his efforts, he had the support of members of Hervé de Charette (ehemalig UMP, now in NC) received a claim on the property of the brand UDF, because he was the first this brand 2004 in the 'Institut national de la propriété industrial "has asked for.
However, the geschäftstelle of François Bayrou's friends supervised parteienbündnisses UDF silence and clearly have to understand that you are not speaking, expropriate the Minister and the Members, under threat of judicial persecution a deadline, this seals no longer to use and the property rights of the brand.
They have in the past few days, many of the statements that their political movement would propose that udf-siegelzu + + play, wrote this in a grouping of 19 of the 24 letter signed büromitglieder, including François Bayrou and Marielle De Sarnez, the party modem and the senator Jean arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They believed, arguably, that they have the right to the name of this movement + to centre plus, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material and the startseite leads its website.
As you know, they have no right to use this label, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party in NC, "without mentioning the name UDF of sämtlichem material and (ITS) website."
In addition, one of Hervé de Charette required ", the property rights of the brand to transfer from their legal anspruchsberechtigen."
If they refuse, we will take action against them, as in the law and respect the legitimate rights of udf-mitglieder to defend, warned the undersigned.
In her letter, you emphasised that "UDF" since 1978 a fully-fledged political movement is and reiterate that Morin and his friends' the choice 'of these 2007 to leave a competing movement, as others have done in 2002 by the party "UMP'.
The party to centre has, therefore, the undersigned, all rights, the udf-siegel (Union pour La démocratie française).
You still remember that the last congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year join the party modem and the creation of a secretariat for the defence of the material and moral interests "of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has adopted.
What Hervé de Charette, so far, the secretariat, 'he was at the time, as he has requested the brand for three years no longer a Member of the UDF "but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent way, by the lack of depositing of akronyms UDF, in order to carry out this for themselves.
They continue to bear in mind that this recklessness, is on track to turn itself into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us but in politics as in life, was present to make yourself a name, rather than to try to come out of anonymity, by relying on fraudulent way takes on a name, it has no legal rights."
Affaire liliane bettencourt, françois-marie banier will condemned because of exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre, on Friday, decided to assess the artists françois-marie banier, to see whether he, like the daughter of milliardärin liliane bettencourt said that a weak moment of achtzigjährigen has used a portion of their assets to devious.
The 62-jährige photographer who is known for his starfotos, on 15 and 16 April 2010 because of exploitation of weakness in court must answer a criminal offence, with a maximum of three years ’ imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375.000 is punished.
This decision means that there is indeed a process in this affaire will give the saga is one of the richest families of France is worthy of mother and daughter shreds, and at the same time the reins of the kosmetikimperiums l oréal in their own hands.
Equally, however, ordered the 15 Court a medical examination of the 87-jährigen liliane bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and hauptaktionärin L ’ oréal, has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation of the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre's conditions.
Friday appointed to doctors before 10 March 2010 to submit a report in which it will clearly indicate whether, and at what times are liliane bettencourt found in a state of weakness.
I think you will these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs bettencourt, me Georges kiejman, after the negotiations.
What the lawyer by Françoise bettencourt-meyers, me Olivier metzner, it is the decision of the Court of very satisfied.
This is excellent news (...). The reports will prove that he (banier) this old lady has been manipulated, affirming the need to protect it.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of liliane bettencourt a criminal complaint against françois-marie banier, photographer and allroundkünstler, and accused him the weakness of their mother for years, have exploited for grants, out of a total of a billion euros in the form of bankschecks, insurance policies or paintings to devious.
For its part, liliane bettencourt had been judged to have been manipulated by the photographers, you, as a long-standing friend.
Although the Court the admissibility of Mrs bettencourt-meyers should examine complaint launched, the plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a great familiendebakel.
The lawyer of liliane bettencourt to three of his klientin to their lawyer were sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise bettencourt-meyers distrustful of.
According to her lawyer added liliane bettencourt as follows: "could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, and twice daily to banier wrote.
Since she married Françoise, I have never been able to speak '.
The public prosecution service of Nanterre is, once again, the view that the klägerin, had no right to respond, especially since a vormundschaftsrichter in the last few days has rejected their request, a legal form of protection against their mother.
Liliane bettencourt "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection, and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "reaffirmed the representative of the public prosecutor's office, marie-christine daubigney.
The Court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the process to the admissibility of Mme bettencourt-meyers has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing-revolution: it is for staff to "values" determines the best, as it used to be on the consumer-produkte of the technicians in work designed to regulate.
By customers in the heart of the companies, the marketing-revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets have been in place... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much wider phenomenon, especially the employees affected.
This demobilisation is having a negative effect on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R & eund, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, calls for the as (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it is a commitment by the employee, which the instructions of the authoritarian management totally disagree.
That is why we are calling for a revolution that it would be the staff in denmittelpunkt the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very conditional use of internal polls
Are the internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange his, has made this revolution in terms of the management-praxis suggest?
I fear that, unfortunately not.
- first, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many a circuitous route, after all this, primarily, to do... what it has always done.
Also because of authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most leaders a very simplistic view of human behaviour.
Emerged from the great ingenieurschulen is your interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which was recently approved by the US "neuroscience progresses" reactivated and unwittingly far-reaching from research institutes, and by the media.
Therefore, and also suggests that it is possible, the "leverage" (sic) to the commitment of staff, confirms to engage in a aktuellein Le figaro.fr appeared survey by ipsos executives in a position on a mechanistischen management system, which is not suitable for the contemporary world.
The mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and attach
Instead, for the smooth operation of the modern companies necessary operational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It is, in any consideration or practice of managing a fundamental minutes to integrate: for the workers is the commitment for the company will be possible only if it appears clearly as a means to a part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Now accept only the studies from the multifunctional analysis this idea of the motivation of staff.
These studies have shown that they put their companies on the basis of a given set doxa assess their wahrgenommenes picture of the company, to imagine what it allows them to realise their lebensziele offers.
Thanks to the identification and measuring this mobilisierungsfaktoren can the leaders of the companies' control their "social performance, forecasts and anticipate and its human resource management back to the right place.
So you will provide a fertile breeding ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence is favourable.
Talk of Oslo, the "just war" Obama praise from law an
On Friday, the American right by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo crafted speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives who the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded this time of the speech by the President, the example of the former vizepräsidentschafts-kandidatin in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, declared Palin the face right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA today, and added that they themselves are the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben raised memoirs published.
The war is, of course, the last of which I believe that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush inherited, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, trying to justify the use of force; a way his entscheidungvon nine days to explain 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the präsdent have in Oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was very good indeed, frohlockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to 'the existence of evil in the world "in Obama's words.
In some parts of habeich this speech altogether ginrich perceived as historic, said in the radio programme "the takeaway" has been questioned.
The previous Members by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to see a "President of the left" to the members of the Nobel Committee reminding that they "were not free and a price for peace could not pass unless the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American" speech.
In addition to that, that he is a "who is" how "he always does," he has "as an American President said," as he pointed out that the Europeans, "as in a sicherheitsblase life that they themselves have created for their protection, and not much to be done," gerson.
Among the few not frantic rights, called the former uno-botschafter John Bolton, a hawk the Bush era, the speech on the website of the national review online as "boring, unfocused and inspirationslos".
To the left of the President is the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
Wrap up the war in the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents simply justify, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, has called the speech itself for a speaker as him, for his talent is known as "monumentalwerk".
The speech in Oslo "offers a ablaufplan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse," and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time.

The stundensatz for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8,72 euro on 9,06 euro.
"It is not very much but we are first of all small in," Mr Clos (Fo).
The activists are now no longer rely versorgungszentren to block it.
"There will be some, however, are likely to be rebellious, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The tlf-vorsitzende Philippe grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult, "these wage in the face of international competition, directly or indirectly".
According to him, increasing at 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"this agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (takes), while Thierry douine (cftc) of "a historic agreement".
Richard jaubert (CGT), said here on "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel by 3% and meet the objectives of the overall budget for the road in the first half of 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of 13 monatsgehalt and the modernisation of collective bargaining agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall of the charges for the employers in the tune of 100 million euros' subject for an amendment by the government on the bill berichtigten finances for 2009, which, on the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly was adopted.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the tlf that the agreement allows for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and that they were in the case of an extension through the Minster for the entire profession.
"in a very short space of time this will be the case," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only postpone the procedure.
The Federation fntr lambasted a "fraudulent trade 'because the 100 million euro" were the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax has already been promised. "
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the gans-esser of the approaching not to weihnachtstagen disgruntling, laments the unostra.
For the association otre threatens the agreement "to small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a major grave to shovels."

New silicon-valley
Long years, it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a strictly bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the town hall, with its 216 000 residents, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley."
Significant research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008 selenograds representative had contacts with the Frankfurt wissenschaftsstandort riedberg - linked with the uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt innovation centre dedicated (fiz).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now and riedberg in Frankfurt selenograd signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation."
The Moscow vize-bürgermeister Yuri rosljak and präfekt Anatoly Smirnov of selenograd led the Russian delegation for Frankfurt signed up for planungsdezernent Edwin black.
2010 will be representatives of the fiz and small and medium-sized enterprises in the science foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel.
Scientific exchanges
It is about a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The firms will fiz to the growing Russian market to be taking root.
Conversely want Russian wissenschaftsfirmen contracts up for grabs in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian institutes and -unternehmen.
For example, these include the Moscow Institute for elektronentechnik sitronics, the large corporations and rosssijskaja elektronika.
The town hall was 1958 as so-called "socialist planstadt" for the defence research has been set up.
Selenograd (literally translated as "grünstadt") received his name of forest hügellandschaft in which the facilities are located.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For advocates of the project is "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than that tieferlegen of a bahnhofs, more than a monströses construction project that the city of baden-württembergischen country's capital for a decade in utter baustellenchaos will fall.
Stuttgart 21, in the spirit of the 1980s.
Kopfbahnhöfe with tracks, which end up in the middle of the city, was seen at the time as verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19th century, as bremsklötze of a modern rail transport appeared, as it was once a tremendous amount of time needed, locomotives back umzuspannen forward.
Trial, in short, to go further - so ´ s.
And that is why the kopfbahnhöfe disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof the rules half-way through the trans-European schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - is therefore the slogan of 'the heart of Europe ".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city, which is almost priceless tieferlegen.
Kopfbahnhöfe but have no one and ausfahrtsproblem more, since it modern wendezüge with locomotives and steuerwagen at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the ice-neubaustrecke after Ulm is now being addressed.
Crossing and local politicians have it enforced.
Power with the railways, partly because the risks of the largest infrastruktur-einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the staatskonzern.
Städtebaulich, the project is still reasonably justified.
There is new stadtraum, is the computergenerierten tables illustrating the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system rail is s21 harmful.
The durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau for the movement of people are thought to be - typical 1980s - huge growth barriers imposed.
At that time there was not yet the competition of the low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy but it must first be a question of freight, as transport by train is significantly more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads.
But the neubaustrecke because of intense steigungen is not for freight trains.
Much more serious is that s21 many other bahnprojekte also indirectly affected.
Good six billion euros in schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
What is certain is that in the next decade is that money to other hubs and engstellen in the net.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the department.
One of the most important is the development of good 180 kilometres long journey through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, will take part in the route in the zeitlupentempo being built.
Urgently needed, would be the right thing on the tube.
But s21 will act as a brake.
The rheintalstrecke is the real bottleneck for international freight, right in the heart of Europe.

Rapid election
It was then everything is faster than thought.
Barely two weeks after the zdf-verwaltungsrat the editor-in-chief Nicholas brender had pushed out of the station, can present a successor.
Last night, the panel on the personalie wanted to vote.
As a favourite was Peter Frey, the head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios in Berlin.
A confirmation from the station for it was not, however, the procedure - officially not look ahead.
However, it should also have played a role, the zdf-intendanten Markus schächter not further damage this proposal to the board should also not be allowed to succeed.
Frey, schächters candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder.
The result of the vote was in redaktionsschluss this edition.
Two weeks ago was schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas brender to extend for a further five years, on the board failed.
Only seven Members have argued for brender, seven voted against it. Brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the unionsmehrheit on the board had already weeks before the election, indicated brender not to want to testify in office.
Had organised resistance to the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under brender had the news of the ZDF lost in ratings, has refused to accept a further term of office of the highly-regarded chefredakteurs.
Until just before the election, there was therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Most recently, even 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the actions chefs as unconstitutional to be reexamined.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter Frey on 4 August was born in 1957 bingen.
He was an romanistik teaching methods and policy.
Later, he worked in the südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
The ZDF Frey changed in 1983, firstly on the "heute-journal".
Subsequent phases: in 1988 to 1990 personal spoke of the chefredakteurs; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and host of "morgenmagazins"; by 2001, head of the zdf-außenpolitik head of zdf-hauptstadtstudios; since then.
The Greens have announced the dismissal brenders on Wednesday or the branchenblatt medium magazine for journalists of the year was elected, a verfassungsklage.
Chefs adversary in the Board of rheinland-pfälzische Prime Minister, Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should zdf-staatsvertrag arrangements that shift personalvorschläge of intendanten not by a politically motivated majority can be blocked.
An excerpt from parteipolitikern from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF, however, also Beck.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey was the board with a wise move, recommended by the panel immediately after the brender-abwahl sharply criticized for it.
Thanks to this belegs journalistischer independence could schächter both him without losing face for the post of chefredakteurs nominate and the board without a vote, in the suspicion that a partisan in order to lever into office.
In the parteiarithmetik Frey will, in any case, the liberal left-wing.
The study will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students, after a year of bildungsstreiks drew culture of the countries on the Thursday at last: at a meeting of kultusminister- and hochschulrektorenkonferenz both sides agreed to the studienbedingungen in bachelor and masters course to want to improve.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
In detail, it is important to reduce the prüfungsbelastungen studienmodul should each: in principle, only with a single audit.
In addition to the workload of the students checked and "a realistic and acceptable level".
Politics and universities also want the recognition of prüfungsleistungen between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed to common strukturvorgaben for bachelor- masters and more flexible.
It is also different länderregelungen not.
Less trials
Since the beginning of the student protests in June uni-rektoren culture ministers and bear the common dictum of better studierbarkeit in the mouth.
For the first time it has now been filled with a specific content.
The so-called akkreditierungsrat decided that the number of tests, in part to reduce dramatically: "every modul, usually with just a test," it said in a 30-seiten-papier that the approval of courses in part to new rules.
With the "significant reduction in prüfungslast," said the akkreditierungsrat-vorsitzende Reinhold fairy tale, should a "drift be curbed, which was significantly studierbarkeit."
In addition to the "studierbarkeit" in the future, "a determining factor" in the design.
Modules as contents were "strictly in response to examine whether" unnecessary einengungen in the election of the students
Events "would be avoided.
The students' claim that margins would receive the initiative, which enable and promote ".
The rules should apply in the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "– which means that it will take until 2015, until all courses were reviewed.
Bundesweit are responsible for 10 akkreditierungsagenturen from the countries established akkreditierungsrat.
The Culture Minister had the countries in October "vigorously" for the agencies to make sure that the stofffülle the prüfungsregime not too big and not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and colleges with the landesministerien already agreed to take appropriate measures.
One country than previously said it Rheinland-Pfalz for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds.
The money should the universities in particular, and tutorenprogramme studienberatung and audit and auslandsämter strengths.
Country and universities want for ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the hochschulgesetzes into Parliament.
After this is for the conclusion of a studienmodells just one more study is needed.
The studiengestaltung will also become more flexible, to the recognition of leistungsnachweisen to other universities, and guarantee easier access to the Masters Course.
By the end of next year all are courses of the country on their studierbarkeit be reviewed.
The government and the opposition had on Thursday again on the studienbedingungen argued in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The bundesvorstand the juso-hochschulgruppen asked that the design of the education policy should no longer "behind closed doors" of the ministers and hochschulrektoren take place.
At the latest, after the bildungsstreiks should now the students as affected "a say too."
The future graduates received support from the President of the hochschulrektorenkonferenz (hrk), Margaret wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the culture with which the hrk on a common reform paper was discussed.
The trade union education and science (gew), the Bonn Agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal entitlement, every graduates with a bachelor-abschluss access to a secondary Masters Course. '
The other countries will have to make sure that for the current generation of bachelor-studierenden tomorrow sufficient masterstudienplätze with best studienbedingungen available, so gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar.
The countries must be much more lecturers.
Freer access to master the culture minister, however, were not.
More than a footnote to herta Müller
In Germany and go out is almost no control... "is the anfangszeile of a gedichts of lyrikers Werner söllner in which this in troubling sprachfetzen the ankunftserfahrung of dissidents, of the freedom won, but at the same time his language has lost.
The 1951 in the Romanian banat söllner Werner was born as a first - speaking German and englischlehrer in Bucharest and later worked as lektor in a kinderbuchverlag before he 1982 after Frankfurt übersiedelte.
Söllner is with various literaturpreisen been excelled in 1993, kept the legendary Frankfurt poetikvorlesungen in the goethe-universität, and since 2002, he is head of the hessischen literaturforums in mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major außerliterarisches high-profile, he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, with the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten".
Visibly confused and move söllner read a statement in which he schriftstellerkollegen rumäniendeutschen, including Richard Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak and Helmuth frauendorfer, his participation in for the Romanian Intelligence Securitate to admit that he had lost.
Together with some of those present had received the German sprachpreis söllner 1989.
The anwerbungsversuche would gradually begun, first in 1971.
I am, finished söllner, "is someone who is against intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist, Werner söllner is Walter.
Almost at the same time with the nobelpreisehrung for herta Müller and their unprecedented literary grappling with the mechanics of dictatorial rule, the literaturszene, and particularly the Community of from Romania residual German authors by a case that the throes and the cowardice of a political system, signifying one power, which is based on monitoring and spying is based.
Werner söllner is, as far as we can tell bisherigem knowledge, not just perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate-akte have played a role in Walter, said after the confession söllners the literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He did it all for him at the time herausgehauen inexorable points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make that point.
Söllners statement was in the form and in the audience totally unexpected, surprisingly, is the affirmation of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence is not.
Germany is one of post-candlelight sole preserve for securitate-spitzel had already been herta Müller written at the time in July, after having their own acts, 914 pages, had read.
The people concerned, we should be suspect, speculation and, in some respects case may also have known what klarname behind the decknamen sorin, voicu and even Walter verbarg.
Unlike the intensified now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of stasi-akten is dealing with the legacy of the securitate-überwachung still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years has been undermined and obstructed.
One of the birthler-behörde equivalent National Council for processing the securitate-akten (cnsas) was set up until 1999, the publication of the files, however, since then proceeded more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that the administration of the files.
The influence of former securitate-mitglieder in Romania are still very high, something that is documented after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for herta Müller an interview in which a former securitate-chef from temesvar dismissive about the prizewinner.
You have a climate of them; after all, I only once interrogated.
The scandal of the power said quite openly in the guise of the freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case söllner tie, as it has done so often in connection with verschwiegener fault, unavoidable questions.
Why only now? who was hurt? the measured response of the zuhörenden on söllners commitment suggests that the continuation of this chapter rather than urge for apportioning blame and shame will be determined.
To genese of herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if there is a adrett gekleideter außendienstler of a very nice weihnachtsfeier a sports goods manufacturers goodies had distributed, as the new vfb-trainer Christian gross in the company of a Orange plastiktüte of ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene ¨ c-klasse rose.
The man with the enormous glatze did because of him yet chauffieren foreign city.
Otherwise, he had also even be able to travel and alcohol was not involved, and besoffen before happiness was the 55-jährige neither.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow, the work continues.
Or will not get.
In the words of the first three days earlier schweizers pledged: "We have reached the final 8", in the Champions League, thanks to the 3: 1-erfolgs against unirea urziceni from Romania, "but let us not be fooled by the success that it will be a brutally tough fight against the debasement."
The "much more important task before Sunday".
Then, in Mainz the königsklassen-leistung in liga-alltag again.
And the well again exposed weaknesses after the rapid three gates by marica (5), träsch (8) and pogrebnyak (11).
Select
The final 8 of the Champions League (hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) on 18 December in nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers.
The delight at the start of the babbel-nachfolgers fulminanten remained therefore behaviour.
Not only on the supposed saviours of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and spielfreude had given.
I am on the players and I have told them that they should reflect on its strengths, and have urged them to be courageous, declared seelenklempner gross that simply appealing recipe for success, in the therapeut no effect but babbel had had more.
He has a certain magic, was babbel-befürworter Jens lehmann, "If in football, a new impetus, sometimes things happen that you do not have thought possible."
And Sami khedira, after a verletzungspause thanks to his dynamism go straight to the best players on the place in the attempted "phenomenon" with the proverbial "wind of change" and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under babbel was it obvious.
The vfb Stuttgart was not yet out of the woods, warns sportvorstand Horst heldt
The vfb Stuttgart needs but, above all, consistent.
As gross as were very careful not also players and managers, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and totally überforderte defence against the Romanian guests überzubewerten.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0: 4 evil awakening khedira, had come to mind.
And sportvorstand Horst heldt warned that a saisonziel been achieved, the other is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.
That heldt in his 40th birthday even after the first heimsieg since three months after much like celebrating was not to do with the events of the weekend in the form of a just before spielbeginn fernseh-interviews broadcast by torhüter Jens lehmann fresh auflebten.
There are decisions that the other meetings, and not the Jens, heldt which countered criticism from lehmanns.
The had been accused of the board of directors, and become the führungsschwäche trainerwechsel pubertierender fans have decided to pressure.
That also be free day after play had been withdrawn, wertete lehmann is seen as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and will be.
Lehmanns statements were "of pure egotism," keilte heldt, vowing consequences for the schlussmann.
You have no friends for life more, the two forty.
After all, but they have to deal with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste trainerteam the spielerisch and aggressive strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said lehmann and heldt in unison, and the man with the plastiktüte agreed.
Wm-fight in Heavyweight
They hitziges in Bern: continually provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds defended the Ukrainians his schwergewichts-titel after version of the wbc.
The verdict of the judges argue fell unanimously.
HAMBURG - Vitaly klitschko box-weltmeister remains the heavyweight.
The 38-jährige champion after version of the association wbc defeated in the night on Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 120, 108, 119, 109).
For klitschko, it was the third successful titelverteidigung after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainians had already twice the wbo and wbc world champion.
Unfortunately, it has with the k.o., all expected to have not worked.
Klitschko built his record of 39 victories in 41 profi-kämpfen, twice he had to take on the grounds of injuries beaten.
Challenger Johnson was the first defeat in 24 fight.
Around 17,000 viewers in the Berne arena wanted the 2,02 metres large klitschko the fight, above all, with his left führungshand dictate.
Of the 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, before the end of the klitschko-ära announced they had turned away from but to keep the blows of the champion klitschko, so that its dangerous rights not crucial objective could bring.
A total of passive Johnson too little for a challenger and sought only on the rounds.
Although he provoked klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo hoffmann in the year 2000, with klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The Challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some.
He offended klitschko as "ugly Zombie", "nothing good can '.
The balance was the champion then on Friday, Johnson to provoke the sonnenbrille pushing, by the nose, "in order to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after klitschkos comeback

After almost four years of time-out, he had at the time the Nigerians Samuel Peter in Berlin beaten and "his" wbc-gürtel recovered, which he had previously made without a struggle.
This year, he then defeated in his titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September Chris arreola from the United States.
As I have said in this fight is only a blow abbekommen and am physically very good in form, klitschko had the rapid return to the ring.
His dream, but the unification of all four major title in the family.
Brother Vladimir is wbo and ibf world champion of the associations.
The belt of the wba but has acknowledged the Briton David Haye in November after the 2,13 metres large Nikolai walujew been able to dethrone.
Haye had previously in the summer of one for September planned fight against Vitaly klitschko cancelled.
Supposedly does its promotiongesellschaft now already the fight against klitschko in London wembleystadion.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, Defence Minister guttenberg, because of the incorrect information to kunduz-affäre as a liar.
SPD and left are calling for clarification of the Chancellor.
HAMBURG / Berlin - the latest information on the air strike in kunduz, to the opposition Defence Minister karl-theodor guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The ministers have to deadly bombing in two tanklastzüge from September 'turn a blind eye to the falsehood "said grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday in the ard-nachrichtensendung" Tagesschau ".

Traumwelten
Some people see in wachem state pictures and hear voices, the other not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and the drogenrausch blurring the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it is happening in their sleep, all is well.
If we, with our eyes closed dark rooms, let us uninhibitedly the wildest ideas and phantasiegebilden indulge in.
Who, in the wachsein traumartige conditions saw things, and does, the other not see or hear that, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drogensüchtig, at least as sonderling.
But such images and voices do not arise only in mental health or in drogenrausch.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that will enable us to design houses to Ireland or pictures, to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between the dream, fantasy and reality are becoming increasingly blurred.
Traumartig modified wachbewusstseinszustände in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if there is cause and effect may be different visions of the mystikerin hildegard of bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of new-age-propheten Carlos castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but in a similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural botenstoffe dopamin - particularly of the brain, noradrenaline and serotonin, derailment acetylcholin - and the interaction of different gehirnteile is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The gravity has no power over him
The link between fantasy and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle term hallucinations as a form of dreams in discarding state, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, noted 1861 a "very reminiscent of the irreseins with traumzuständen" for Sigmund Freud was the dream is "a climate, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, sinnestäuschungen such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comicfigur.
His body has developed along two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power over him, he is hanging in the zimmerdecke.
He senses a date.
Behind him saying teufelsgestalten with blutroten, distorted fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They are hunting him to it with heavy, flammenden stiefeln accusing him against the walls, it senses the pain in the whole body.
Noisy, malicious dröhnen voices from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the votes to insult and offend him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet it a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising at a loudspeakers and establishes the noose around the neck.
Leaps.
The noose does.
This should be a lesson to you, shout the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "walk in the clinic and let you cure."
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychoses, the latter of which is 2 years back, the first for nearly 20 years.
It was caused by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide climate, it is also manisch-depressiv, he takes medicines, against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years now, he married.
In the climate of fear in the worst I have seen and deepest despair, he says.
The mere empty words are cruel reality
Around one per cent of the population is afflicted with schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric hospitals will it as the second most ill after the depression.
In an emergency schizophrenic climate mostly affected can no longer distinguish between the internal and outside world, you get trapped in a übererregten state, of the scale, hallucinations, relationships or verfolgungswahn can lead.
It is particularly prevalent stimmenhören - voices orders, comment on or dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The article is important not to separate more of unwichtigem embarrassing signals, the brain can no longer overseas, the awareness is swamped by impression.
As the dream opens the climate of the floodgates for a deluge of ideas and fantasies, the deeper bewusstseinsschichten bracket.
The realitätswahrnehmung in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fox, oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the event, everything has a meaning to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as happens in the dream, of the events overwhelmed and can you not actively shape.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A realitätsabgleich is generally have not possible, the cruel reality are mere empty words, wake up.
Once in a lifetime, to have seen a halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says Fox, "is but the sinnliche and spatial structure of the reality, which is perceived in the climate, in principle."
The wahnhaften thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in the reality of the verfremdung of erlebens will take place in real terms.
Exactly why our brains antics proposes, researchers are still a mystery.
Ausnahmezustände can result in every person that he is losing short-lived unrealistic, says Fox.
But not everyone will a climate strategy.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturing of the brain at an early stage of development, will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained Fox.
But there remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system is also the first not manifestiere for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be the catalyst for a climate, if the choice is there.
Halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychoses, since they entered the transmittersystem intervention.
If our brains hot runs
The crazy, psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money on drugs, in order to get what, says the lübecker psychologieprofessor Erich castes.
Whether mere empty words as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a question of the position.
Castes assembles for ten years reports of hallucinations and trugerscheinungen, last year, he has his findings in the book "The unreal world in our heads."
Hallucinations may belong to the typical features of psychoses, but also of amazing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease and schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from gedächtnisinhalten together that normally be withheld.
They arise if widespread, where sinneswahrnehmungen processed überaktiv are discouraged or too little; if our brains hot runs or, if stimulation lacking.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a climate.
But it is also reizentzug, stress, liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände.
Recent studies were up to a third of those polled said that at least once in a lifetime, to have seen a halluzination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and is visiting the grammar school.
A normal girl, really.
If not for the images and voices.
In the interval, it can happen that a schlaksiger young with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he replies, look at the mitschüler it surprised - nobody else does or does this young.
They do not believe the timid girl for a versponnene tagträumerin, but Sarah K. is not, it knows it.
She is awake, you can see or hear these young, just as the girls in the Bank alongside can see or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may have the young.
Am I mad? asks you sometimes.
But they know that this young and the others are not mere empty words are real, and then disappear.
At night, the phenomena mostly frightening
Often, the mere empty words also a burden.
If you are in school, it can sometimes unterrichtsstoff not impact because the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new mitschüler while he presents for all other radio and visible from the bar of mathematical equations explained.
At night, the phenomena mostly frightening.
If they are following in their dark room to sleep is far too little and too late, it can often not distinguish whether you are awake or already is whether the images they see the fratzen or the girl with the bleeding schnittwunden of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in peace to make you cry.
Parents and friends told you, would you not insane.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has in the past year the baccalaureate were and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since it on the Internet, to contact the psychologists castes, you know very well that they are not crazy.
Fantasy is also a work of art out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or under reizentzug he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a einzelkind, had as a little girl fear other children, often, she played alone.
When they began their hallucinations with 13 learned that the man that they Papa, since it is not their leiblicher father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations the same hirnbereiche active, are the real impressions and sounds process, it is going to be affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between reality and mere empty words. "every experience," says castes, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain can give, and that is why they are so real. "
Also night traumbilder assesses castes as a form of halluzination.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from which an acute climate.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy its mere empty words as unreal.
Castes advises his patients, therefore, that the hallucinations as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Grenzzustand between dream and halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world is, unfortunately, are mostly pathologisiert imaginary, says Michael schmidt-degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chefarzt the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A climate is a terrible, tragic disease, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-degenhard, the so-called oneiroide erlebnisform researched, a special form of traumartig modified wachbewusstseins.
Oneiroide are detailed quasi-träume hochkomplexe the erlebende for real, and he subsequently also by the wachzustand can distinguish.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand is emerging in trauma- or krankheitsbedingten extreme situations, for example in polyradikulitis-patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a man of self- and weltverlust around is threatened by continuing complete impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality by their own imaginary world, detached from reality is, says schmidt-degenhard.
A kind grenzzustand between dream and halluzination.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a weltwechsel, but the reality is, in the imagination.
An intensive form of sinnstiftung and meaning in a precarious situation, the US gestaltungsfähigkeit own people, not in a nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes sink.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The devoted art Peter Cornelius claussen describes his oneiroid-erlebnisse in his book "herzwechsel" as to the rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his conscience after a herzklappenoperation, followed by a herztransplantation posted on travel, while his body in critical care to maintaining.
Claussen in a selbstgeschaffene world, a visiting alien times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a zugsanatoriums, a robot watchdog on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs under nobles from blood.
It is a Greeks on a motorcycle in its own country, abducted, surf with his spitalbett in firnschnee of the Alps and hits a Korean mafioso.
He is totally on the imagined had happened, everything is real, later in the memory.
This internal travel for claussen differ fundamentally from every dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
Quite the contrary, I have the memories from mental travel even after years and in minor details unambiguous.
More and more even than really erlebtes.
The intensity of the erlebens goes far beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen schmidt-degenhard experience, says the psychiatrist.
Ultimately show oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drogenrausch how fragile our internal abbilder of external reality in the discarding.
Any change in the bewusstseinszustandes, summed the psychologist castes, "can lead to a verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be enrichening.
The schneeeinbruch can come
Burda
Should children play with 27 years the publisher
The new verlagschef kallen is an interim solution: in the long run wants Hubert burda his company in the hands of his two children, he told the mirror.
The holding will also in future to 100 per cent of the family.
HAMBURG - a publisher Hubert burda, his company in the long term, in the hands of its children.
Both children heirs of 27 years and have the will, the company, said the 69-jährige the mirror.
The details of this, we have taken the precaution of regulated.
The question of whether they are active in the company, only then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot swallow, 7 500 staff his children if they are not sufficient are able.
That brings the children and the fact that the company also.
Burda had on Thursday announced that he will withdraw from January by the company ’ s board, and paul-bernhard kallen appointed to his successor.
The 52-jährige since 1999 in a kallen burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury taking responsibility for the unternehmensvermögen to this, and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer for direct marketing and abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, is not a family member at the head of the verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of kallen also serve to "10, 15 years," burda to bridge.
The holding should continue to 100 per cent of the family, burda said.
With regard to the cases schickedanz and schaeffler, said burda that family businesses are not safe from disaster: "This was always families who have contracted by a kapitalsucht quite verspekuliert and thought that they could have a very big player to climb.
My strategy, this was never.
He had "never weltmachtträume" that he had burda.
I am not as the political präzeptor of this country, as it Springer was, and I do not want to a global player with 'time', a game this shops are too great.
The promises of fonpeek
Peek is äuβerst limited, a device that allows you to only his e-mails can read without an opportunity to be able to see some annexes or be able to surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame when the magazine time on one of the products of the year.
On the straβe to see is unlikely, but the idea itself is still, particularly for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones peek cost very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half the price of a flat rate of a iPhone.
After the success that the company has seen, it has two new products on the market, one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong gratisservice for data, as opposed to the peek, at which it must pay a six times higher.
Fonpeek yesterday in the event Le web is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as its American counterpart, has, however, a surprise.
The monthly unterhaltspreis for the telephone, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who, with a smartphone at the world travel, already know what it means to all of the data to have to give up in order to be able to read his emails, once we cross the border, or if you are desperate for a café with WiFi addiction (or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should in fact be possible for a long time.
It is true that some of their objections already specific contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience it needs to be a doctorate in physics and a good glasses in order to be able to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission regarding affordable roaming prices for the whole of Europe, have remained almost always unheard.
Auβerhalb of the country has always been afraid his emails to read and rightly so.
That a small piece of equipment such as fonpeek (with it but, again and again, it is amazing that it has the name of fon, although it has no WiFi / wlan) this kind of tariffs can offer means that their objections slowly, but surely the mentality and must start to consider several options as to how they can use the Internet.
Kindle is another good example, in his prices is the downloaded of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges equipment, and it is paying only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And this is precisely what I do one day, fonpeek expect a kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong tightens as it is, the peek already in the United States.
And this not because I want to buy.
I read my emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect that because I am of the opinion that it would be more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see time with a computer to see the same system.
The fetischfarbe of Michelle
Amber is, without a doubt, the lieblingsfarbe of American first lady.
Even in the case of the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States seemed to them in a dress and a veil of the colour, and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models: borne auβer that it is almost the same colour was - a shining grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same clothing, and that it was something groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette.
It even goes so far as that at the first sight seemed that the first lady of the United States to follow in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, distinguish between the two clothes but much in the stoffart from which they are made.
It was with the inauguration of a dress from head and one from gemusterten together in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time Green shoes with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Every time the hair style was different: the hair on this occasion as haarkranz upset, the earlier, the hair open.
75% of working mothers have given their babies problems in the work get
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, particularly among the younger women who want to have children.
To this result is the csic in collaboration with the Institute for women survey conducted "fertility and career of women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career are in the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study, frankly, that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work.
Those of you who have no other activity auβerhalb of the House, just halbtags work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a strong employment, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and children and therefore have fewer children.
"The women aged between 35 and 49 years with a strong employment their first child on average only 3.7 years after the zusammenziehen, a number of 4.1 years for women with permanent employment increased have taken longer to achieve this and their zusammenziehen and the first child until much later have achieved.
Auβerdem also has the type of work a groβen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the empfängnisbereitschaft ", explains the csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether you just completed or a higher education have, on average, each with 25,1 or 32,1 mother for the first time.
There is also still, depending on their level of education, which is also a difference between the women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before your first get married and have their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way round and seek out only a permanent employment and marry later and then get their first child, Delgado.

Here, he used a predictable and furchteinflöβendes genre (kurzbiografie, live and work), but is looking for a änhlichkeit the fervent heart of the Creator.
The trip is an exciting and Vicent saves neither of horrors still erleuchtungen.
Auβer that this book is a köstlicher lesegenuss, too, it is a stirring incitement to read and read again and again.
Here are a few ausschnitte from the book.

On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the messerklinge that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "our man was from this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, dermaβen in its ranks, in whose meat because the emotion of adultery, with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the face of verderbens to come."
On James Joyce's "Ulysses," has been in 1922 in Paris issued by Sylvia beach. It is one of the 8000er summit in global literature, must be made to the nordwand hinaufklettern, on the wall, to again and again and again, the best mountaineers try. "
On William Faulkner: "The was a comical kauz.
He said sometimes of himself that he inherited a gutsbesitzers County would be and then other times, he said that he was the son of a black and a krokodils would be.
Both dreams zeugten of a certain gröβe. "
On louis-ferdinand céline: this writer took the insane cry from a bridge from the figure from Munich hinausgeschrieen, so that its response has been deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way out. Hallte that he made during a journey on which he himself took and with a speech full of violence against the würmern anflehte posterity.
On Dorothy Parker: "one day you kniete nationalisms and point out: my dear God, I would ask you, do everything in your power to do that I am leaving finally, as a woman to write."

On Virginia Wolf, "in her luggage, she had also always their depression.
The husband took it with utter normalcy, if he said that Eduard VII they between the azaleen ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek.
It is not one other case where the man so much patience and turn it into a neurotikerin was in love, whose literary talent still much gröβer than their craziness. "
On pío baroja: 'What made martín-santos otherwise attempting to Joyce's themes in baroja?
What intended for benet, if he baroja not to the weapons of Faulkner heranführte?
What made cela because, apart from the glory of that man to destroy themselves, so that he can put on this podest? "
Cowardly aggression
My 70 years mother was last week by the district in the town of fuenlabrada love, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years in addition to their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a mischling that we have obtained from a rescue and just six kilos, and then come out of the blue missed him two fußtritte and injured him so that difficult.
Our indignation, one can never be in words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where since the spass in a cheap aggression against a small and hilfloses animal, which is, of course, be on the leash.
Added to that is the erstickungsanfall, a woman who was love comfortable, when you take these people for the reprimands to others wanted, they feared even for their own lives, for if such a wahnsinniger a dog, he will attack the same perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each of weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet areas at 5 p.m. on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
We have, of course, in a nahgelegenen football intelligence unit, submitted a complaint, however, but we have grave doubts about whether that will lead to anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the very beginning that we would like to make it clear that only the cowardly Spaniards were criminals.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what in the minds of these young people that they have to do a cheap attack on a hilfloses animal fun to find an animal that we love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education, and the respect for the animals and the people who remain.
Michelin and fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish foundation for traffic safety (fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs particularly among the younger motorcyclists are launched, as now announcement from both companies.
This initiative wants to draw attention to the importance of the helmgebrauchs, because this is ultimately about the only schutzelement which clubbed or even death in the case of a motorradunfalls able to prevent.
Michelin, has pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in relation to road safety, "far more than just the design and manufacture of products that with each day always safer" and reaffirmed that they will continue with other actions educational and informative character contribute to this aim, every day, a step closer to peace.
This new campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs on a motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' expires, in a first phase posters to distribute more than 500 motorradwerkstätten the bestmöglichste spread.
Michelin said concluded that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and for precisely the reason that you as a producer of tyres for zwei-rädige vehicles always committed to see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products should be.
The sale of kleinlastwagen is rising again to something
After almost two years of discrepancies within the beginning of the kleintransporter finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months gemäβ decrease, keep going with the herstellerverband anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam figures presented.
This good numbers, however, are currently only with groβer great care, as the genieβen comparison seem other in November 2008, which is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, in addition to the increase in the last month, the gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40 per cent below the sale of the previous financial year.
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles sold in this number, but all vehicles from which the kleintransportermarkt is that contain: descendants of cars, pick-ups, kleintransporter, small vans and lighter kleinlastwagen / chassis.
Furthermore, it is still the same storm clouds in the sky, the demand in the most affected, because even though a few of the vehicles purchased by individuals, is the groβteil the sales to small and medium-sized companies, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase by a drittfinanzierung placed.
It has to be on these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten geldhahns of credit institutions are other factors with einschlieβen, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this landscape and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000e little helped.
This plan is, however, not only for individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if you are a kleintransporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2-ausstoss, not 160 grams per gefahrenen kilometres may exceed want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had ganvam reminded that it is required by the state, is also a special attention to this kleinlaster and, naturally, on the industriefahrzeuge (trucks and buses).
The autohändlervereinigung predicts for 2010 is a similar year as last, for which it with a verkaufsausfall (for passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was already the antiblockierbremssystem section just now and what is happening control (ESC stability control of the hilfssysteme on the brakes in an emergency pflichtausstattung in European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all newly registered cars and light kleintransportern, for the rest of the vehicles has been a karenzfrist until the end of February 2011.
The adopted by the European Union maβnahme has aimed to improve the protection of fuβgänger, however, these braking systems because of their operation also help many front-rear collisions could be prevented.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers system, on the basis of the drivers on the bremspedal trafficked bremsstärke recognises.
This system, however, is not that pressure until the end.
According to the komponentenhersteller for the bosch-fahrzeuge research, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the zusammenstoss no longer to do so, on the bremspedal, half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1 000 accidents
The bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and the bremszeit reduced, and thus also the bremsabstand a car in the bremsvorgang truck.
According to a study in the EU could each year of up to 1 000 fatal accidents, where fuβgänger harm to come, be prevented if all cars equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even fewer accidents, it has been calculated that one in four accident involving personal injury, could be prevented, once the so-called intelligent popular measures.
The vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles understands and the drivers warns, while at the same time there has been a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the drivers, then the system will help him here, to increase pressure on the bremspedal if there would be needed.
If the driver has not responded to the warning, and even if the zusammenstoss already is unavoidable, is the bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, thus damage as far as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the opel-werks in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) already by Nick reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, were informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first aprilwoche will probably start on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers, like to point out that he needs more time to the rescue plan for Opel to bring them to a conclusion.
Nick reilly, the new head of GM Europe, will in fact ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for that reason it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be put off until the start of 2010.
Dementgegen will from GM said that it will not in the next few days, a decision on the sale of Saab meeting.
So it is not surprising that the Swedish Government to put pressure on the American industry has increased as soon as possible, so that a decision.
GM exists, with some possible new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could also be geely, Volvo, but would like to buy up the option of the Dutch manufacturer of skyper-sportwagen by the Russian group converg backing has always stronger.
If there are none of these buyers should come to an agreement could GM some assets to the Chinese baic sell.
The decision to Saab at the end of the year to schlieβen, if it was not sold by then, will also continue.
At the helm of Porsche boxster spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive juwels's boxster the engineers used as a basis and succeeded him, but what is really about 80 kilos to make it easier, and he is now only 1.275 kilos of the world.
So, the first thing you do not support the automatic aufklappbare roof, a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem accord has been replaced, so that alone, 21 kilograms would be saved by this model; thanks aluminiumtüren used as the gt3 "disappearance" another 15; by the deletion of the air conditioning, 13; auβerdem one has the kraftstofftank from 64 to 54 gallons of winding down, so that further 7 kilos, were saved by the installation of sporting bacquet-sitzen 12 months and again with the slight 19-zoll-felgen saved five again.
Then there was also due to the audio-system cdr-30 again six kilos less and the exchange of türgriffe by griffe from substance the lack of kilos.
Although he, too, with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the probefahrt with a vehicle with handgetriebe 6-gängigen carried out mainly focused on the smaller landstraβen of California, on bergstrecken who really very kurvig.
In his driving can be given only the note perfectly.
The reduction of his weight, but not this geführtdass he is now no longer so sure on the straβe would lie.
Rather, the opposite is the case: since long have we no longer a small and light model probegefahren that a but also a feeling of safety in the groβer graphs, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of it, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders to curb rasen to recover and then all over again from its engine to get out...
He is doing what he says the car makes everything we do it with our hands on the steering wheel indicate, thanks to its management, as well as precise as kommunikativ.
And he is doing it with the precision of a surgeon who.
A motorsound for all tastes
The sound of his v6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster s) is very good and it cannot increase with the 'sport' -option and by means of a system where the motorgeräusche can change the panamera, which already has been used for the first time.
The beschleunigungsvermögen is unbelievably brutal, whether from the stand out or at the latest.
The federungen are strong, but not hard or obstinate.
The asphalt on the landstraβen where we are with the boxster spyder aboard, was quite damaged but the car meisterte the schlaglöcher good.
The electronic assistants had on the whole almost nothing at all to do; and that, although we have some of these graphs ice at dawn and rollsplitt in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that there is a ultraleichtes car is a car, with whom you have an indescribable fahrspass, as it would otherwise have to be more rare and it is much more than just a small improvement on the boxster SS.
In February 2010 the car will come on to the market and 70.831 euros.
Bag girl '
The singer, a busenfreundin by Karl lagerfeld, is the face of the kosmetiklinie Coco cocoon and a gelegenheitsstarlett in the modenschauen of 'Maison', you presented your rude face with the same halsstarrigkeit as their pockets of chanel.
Much more than "bad girl" or "it girl", it is a "bag girl."
The baskonia themselves to a victory in Israel.
The caja laboral story, despite the many popular players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, a magnificent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex fuβballfeld of maccabi Electra and thus ends up in the first place in its Group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza teletovic, with eight triple the best of his team was in the assessment (29).
The team from Vitoria, the significant shortfalls of herrmann, oleson, huertas or micov by a very broad sense of commitment and team work, even if you replace to the bitter end to its victory muβten wait.
The great hits out from the perimeter, with 16, valued at three times maβgeblich contributed to its final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blauroten right from the start to take the lead on the anzeigentafel.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out from the perimeter, it was already guessing that it on to the pitch with good aufgewärmten handgelenken.
There were English and teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was little different, except that the team from models for a innenseitiges game of barac, and for the game of Eliyahu, on his return to the team with pfiffen and applause was received, in the wake of his home is to their advantage before the break further strengthen (34-43).
Teletovic began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points wennn also highlight the "minus six" evaluation of the splinter already lieβen guess is that this is not the best night of brasilianers would be.
Nevertheless, the game despite the clear advantage in the interval not yet been decided and the makkabäer vitorianer wanted to recall once again that, on the pitch, not everyone wins, and thanks to the always prepared "hand of Elías" they came into play.
Eidson and pnini contributed central to ensuring that the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few spielzüge with accuracy in order to get back to air in life and one of them was suddenly the pistol of Mirza teletovic, with three almost successive triple and with the backing of English and ribas to that on the anzeigentafel again einberuhigender distance of (54-67) has been notified by the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) have been able to give.
The alavesen last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San emeterio (60-75) already announced that it would allow anyone to you the victory in the first dreiβig minutes honestly deserved, being taken away again.
Nonetheless resigned pnini and eidson not the best of their team and tried to your team by three points from the line (70-77) force.
In spite of this, and although splinter because fouls in place, the team of Ivanovic was not to be defended well and even though the Israelis nor in the last minute aufholten (85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented unicaja was stood

Thank you!
After the enticing of all days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, was again the uncertainty in the markets, which have certainly not surprising, since this is their natural state is, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The stabilisation of the markets maβnahme was applied to the debt with the direktkauf of assets of liquidity to settle and, indirectly, to have a free hand in interest rates to zero, so that in this way the banks buy assets to the claim.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets are as good as finished, and without their heterodox policy to liquidity, start to throwing sand in the wheels, as the BCE näc already vormachte with your jahresversteigerung, the next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy, the economic recovery without this heterodox maβnahmen alive and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction in the risk premiums.
The flüchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in unternehmensboni rise again, even if it is still a long way from the paranormalen amounts are at the beginning of the year too.
The States have been forced to seek private risks to nationalise and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred shelter of the investors, which in turn will help to increase the differences of the eurozone countries in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now little from this episode of instability affected, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, not to a degree of uncertainty is damaging to the defenders of moral risk to silence tried again, with the leaders of the weltwirtschaftspolitik an awareness, for what had caused it, since it is the devastating effects, which include the restriction of credit that led to the loss of jobs than they really had slowed down a new day for the dankesaktion beschlieβen should have.
Nevertheless, there is what happened in Dubai, on a stammeskrieg between the emiren governments to power in the Emirates and restore the development in Greece has already been previously anticipated.
A government debt, which would deny that elections and a new government, pulling in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the failure of their auslandszahlungen save, and therefore a euro-mitgliedsland granting its commitments, not more.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with, to the stability of public money to maintain.
Yes, we are, as you would expect from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some ausschweifungen to large sums of money, and it would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we must not to worry, as long as the differences of public debt, with the same speed as the European unternehmensboni increase.
However, the European differences should be minimised and the Spanish continuing to increase, it would dannn a special Spanish risk act.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the few early indicators of a groβteil marktforschungsinstitute compel their plans for the recovery and preferable scenario for 2011 to be revised upwards, einschlieβlich the ocde and the European Commission to come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, promises all this happen, despite warnings from a long life span.
Once again, it appears that there is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution when driving" is the order of the day.

Acciona competes with hochtief and Bouygues at his first construction of motorways in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the use of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which it already as energy and wasserunternehmen are represented.
The building, it is a tunnel, 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros) will cost.
The French company Bouygues and the German hochtief are in the process of its competitors.
A 2.5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, is the best opportunity for acciona to become in the country as property developers and autobahnbetreiber.
The City Council would have closed the building at the end of 2014.
After the administration for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided for the project after a business plan drawn up by Ernst & young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and mautstellenverwaltung.
In May, in anticipation of the estimated amount of offers presented investments to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), and in the last phase three consortia, especially from European construction company made up, compete with each other.
The group with the name of transcity acciona, the only Spanish companies, and its partners are BMD and ghella.

The Australian market for infrastructure promises enormous construction and privatisation, has, however, that we need a hurdle to overcome, since it is only by buying a local bauunternehmens, have access.
A strategy that hochtief or bilfinger companies, in addition to Asian references, and are followed by the Spanish baugiganten still needs to be pursued.
Even ACS has to this market only by his participation by 30% share of hochtief, owner of the aforementioned leighton, entry.
Million in assets
Acciona is keen on this geographical area of the utmost importance for the industry, which is already due to his role as an energy supplier and the entsalzungsindustrie very familiar.
Among other assets, it has already taken its gröβten windmühlenpark (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies, which has been appointed, the entsalzungsanlage of Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million to build and to administer.

The City Council disagree with the road map, the award for the summer of 2010, and the start of construction in December next year.
Even if this mautstrecke already for transport in recent months to open by 2014, the assumption is that the work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was drafted in 2005.
He has two fahrspuren in every direction, an electronic toll and a complex entlüftungssystem.

On the other hand, only Spain is in third place in the countries that have been able to einehmen by the champions money, although it more titles than any other has (five, unlike four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent contradiction is explained by the complex gelderteilungsverfahren that UEFA.
In this financial year is estimated the organisation, whose President Michel Platini holds 1.090 million, with revenues from the Champions League.
Of this money does UEFA 413,1 million for fixed payments, each of the 20 fuβballclubs who took part in the qualifikationsvorrunde (including the Atlético de Madrid) was 2.1 million.

There is also a bonus for gain (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs, which have come into the final 8 each received three million; the four, who have come into viertelfinale 3.3 million.
The last four have 4 million each.
The winners earned 9 million, in contrast to the second, the 5.2 million.
It gets a fuβballclub at least 7,1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million of fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned with his victory in the European supercup 2.5 million in August.
However, this is still the variable payments, for the 337,8 million.
This money will be calculated according to the value of each individual fernsehmarkts.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 allocated seats.
The masters last year gets 40% of the allocated currency, 30% of the second, 20% of the drittplatzierte and 10% for the fourth place.
