The citizens of Prague stock exchange falls against business end into the minus. 
After the steep refuse at the morning, stock exchange was able to correct the citizens of Prague the losses. 
The transaction with the shares of reached almost the half of the normal day-to-day business. 
The citizens of Prague stock exchange attached immediately at the beginning of the Tuesday businesses to the break-in of the Monday when it sank around further six points. 
This time the reason lay for the break-in at the Wall Street. 
Also in the Czech Republic, so the reaction of the market appears on the result of the voting of the American House of Representatives, that had rejected it to support a stabilization plan for the finance sector there. 
Case of the shares in Asia 
A dramatic case the shares experienced on Tuesday at the stock exchanges in Asia although the Indices in the course of the day were able to balance a part of the losses. 
The index the cliff Seng stock exchange in Hong Kong lost points in the course of the business day almost four, could bet make however later a part of the losses, therefore the decline diminished yourself on about 2.5 percent. 
The index cliff Seng China Enterprises, that the movement of the Chinese shares observes at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, sank were closed around 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets. 
The shares at the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, diminished however then the losses to 4.3 percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan sank after the index there around 3.6 percent. 
"The timing for the rescue operation in the USA is unsteady and becomes the financial markets worldwide influence", so the boss of the currency authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong determines although it belongs to China, its currency politics itself, therefore independent of the Chinese central bank. 
The interests rates in Hong Kong move on the same level such as that in the United States. 
The American legislators should return after words of the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd as quickly as possible at the negotiation table and should dismiss the design for a support of the financial system. 
Otherwise would threaten that also further countries would be concerned by the break-in. 
A bloodbath of American shares 
The American House of Representatives rejected on Monday the plan for a support of the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars should be spent (almost 12 trillions. 
The legislators ignored so the request of President George Bush to support the plan. 
According to Bushs view the plan would regulate the basic causes for the finance crisis and help therefore to stabilize the total economy. 
The American shares experienced on Monday a bloodbath, and the most important share indices indicated the largest break-in in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index sank around almost seven percent, it had indicated a similar break-in finally in 1987. 
The index had sunk already before the voting, but there was hardly sign that the design would not come through in the house of representatives, experienced the index a free case. 
Congress makes concession: US government may pump 700 billions of dollar into the banks 
The uppermost representatives of the American congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a wider form of an agreement on a finance aid for the American financial system. 
About that voted will should beginning next week. 
The American legislators reached dollars (about 12 trillion crown) in discussions about the dismissal of a rescue plan in form of a finance aid for the American financial system in a circumference of 700 billion a breakthrough. 
To be sure this means yet no victory. 
The congresswomen must negotiate namely a few more details of the agreement before they may publish the final version of the law and may vote about that. 
The plan to the support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American congress. 
On Sunday this said the chairperson of the committee on bank services and finance services Barney Frank of the agency Reuters. 
In the senate could be voted according to different statements probably at the earliest on Wednesday over the plan. 
According to economist a communication should about the fact that the plan is dismissed, that are first important psychological factor for an animation of the financial markets. 
After that it comes however to a "disillusion" based on the complicated mechanisms how one could help the markets also in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We obtained an important progress. 
We clarified our different views in addition, look should like a package to the stabilization of the market", said the democrat Nancy Pelosi vis-Ã -vis the agency Bloomberg. 
According to your words it could come yet on Sunday to an end voting. 
Representatives of the legislator met in the early hours of Sunday with the American Treasury Minister Henry Paulson in order to lend the government fund its final form. 
This plans a purchase of not for sale mortgage assets of the finance companies, that the finance firms fall into heavy losses and the stability of the total system endanger. 
"We stand at the edge of a definitive unification over a plan, that will function and that must be also effective on the market. 
One yet further must continue the recovery plan, but I think, we are on target", so Paulson. 
A signal for Asia businesses 
The global finance crisis finds expression also clearly in the stock markets, that strongly sink. 
The words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the legislators would be striving to arrive yet Sunday ago in the congress at a final unification. 
Therewith one wanted calm namely the investors before businesses on the Asian financial markets, that lie in the first time zone, where a decision of the congress could influence the businesses on Monday. 
Until now however is not yet very clearly when both chambers of the American congress will vote over the law, also rules vagueness about whether the negotiations in last minute could not fail yet yet due to a problem. 
The legislators hope that it is dismissed in the next days. 
The law however will learn a few more variations. 
The total certain to the aid for the system is supposed to be divided in two parts. 
The initial 350 billions of dollar are supposed to be placed as quickly as possible ready how President George Bush demanded. 
The congress can block however the fallout of the remaining money if it has the impression, that the program does not fulfill its function, and to be sure more by more far 100 billions of dollar and later the final 350 billions of dollar. 
Bush appraises progress in negotiations positively 
The president has to be sure in this decision a power of veto, to be sure the congress can be overrule veto. 
In spite of these variations, the basic idea of the program are exist remained however, that was based on that, finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell, to attain because hundreds of thousands of American are no longer in a position to repay its mortgages. 
"We everything prepared. 
The House of Representatives should be in a position to vote on Sunday over the law, the senate then on Monday", so the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
With the progress, also the American President Bush satisfied appeared. 
Its speaker Tony Fratto explained, let Bush be satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and "would appreciate the two-sided exertion to stabilize our financial markets and to protect" our economy. 
Restriction of golden parachute 
The chairperson of the bank committee of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, let be reported, would have the legislators itself on a responsibility for the money program, that protection of the taxpayer before losses, that conclusion of privileges and a timetable united for the financing of the plan. 
The new law should restrict also the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies, who are involved in the program and sets a from shot on, to which the supervision should attend over the fund. 
This should lead the treasury. 
"We very hard on that worked and a large progress toward an agreement reaches, that functions and for the market and for all Americans is important", so Paulson. 
The plan reckons also with an aid for homeowner, who have problems with the repayment of its mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates in mortgages, that buys up it whereby the goal exists therein of sinking the monthly costs for the debtors and it them to enable, its houses to retain. 
Marek: Psychological aid 
The proposed plan is after the head economist of Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, but the conversion becomes very difficult. 
"And to be sure therefore because one do not know, through which mechanism and around which price the problematic assets are bought up. 
That will be decisively for that, divide like the finance sector and the government the losses among one another", said Marek this week iHNed. cz to the server. 
Whether the plan is dismissed now or beginning next week, is not decisive after Mareks view. 
"Much it is more important that the congresswomen agree on that to support the plan and that they as quickly as possible dismiss it. 
The psychological meaning of the agreement about the fact that it comes to a dismissal, the most important is in this moment", emphasized Marek. 
Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3-Player against mobile phone. 
We advise you in your choice 
While almost each mobile phone MP3-Dateien can play back, yet no MP3-Player can telephone. 
Therefore it looks naturally so that it is better to buy itself only a telephone. 
In spite of everything, there are sufficient reasons why one should gain himself an independent Player. 
The choice depends entirely the future owner on the type of the utilization and the claims. 
Certainly one buys himself hardly for at home a crazy expensive turntable in order to sound on that the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for that. 
If have however LPs with type skirt, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream probably at least of one. 
So that is expressed also with the music on trips, therefore with compressed music, simplified - music in the MP3-Format. 
Also here there are price categories and quality categories. 
For the one, it is will bear perhaps not acceptable to issue for a Player eight thousand crowns, just as however a Pink-Floyd-fan probably hardly headphones for twenty crowns of the market. 
Two extreme between which it gives for every sufficient room. 
The selection extend is diversified. 
Also the service life of the batteries is decisively. 
Some good Music Players can play back much more than only music, but that what mobile phones can, they do not create once in outline. 
No modern device is to be used so universal like the telephone. 
Next to the primary functions, that telephoning and the shelf, it can represent music and videos, both receive, it has once a better, once a worse camera and can navigate perhaps also. 
And if one includes yet the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a small miracle, for no refrigerator can grill and can photograph no television. 
Yet the universality of the mobile phones entails also disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequent you will have to load it however. 
And the playing back of music is one of the largest energy gluttons. 
Only a few mobile phones can play back music more long than a ten twelve hours, mostly is it much fewer. 
In this regard, Music Players (special the simplest) are clearly more efficient. 
Therefore you should calculate in the cheap mobile phones therewith that they cannot play back more long music than a couple of hours. 
If you telephone then off and at yet, buy yourself to the security rather another charger for the office - that applies also to more expensive devices. 
In MP3-Playern, you will not have this problem, also that less good at least 9 hours hold uninterrupted business suddenly loading from. 
A further problem exists then if one wants to record the music on the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately only a slight part of the devices controls an USB conclusion, moreover each mobile phone cannot be connected without special software directly to a PC. 
Naturally one can record will be used the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card harvest devices without reduction with the tiny storage cards finished, that in mobile phone. 
In Players, you require up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to line the device only over USB PORT with music out of your PC. 
Most mobile phones and Player design even a music library, organized after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the estimation through user. 
Some devices portray only the tree structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, similar to the windows explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating system). 
Players are to be served more easily, mobile phones can more 
In the selection of a concrete device, you should inquire especially about the service life of the rechargeable battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and naturally also the serve comfort. 
Music is for you above all scenery and hear it every day only shortly for example in the streetcar, passes an any mobile phone, that plays back MP3-Dateien. 
What can really already almost each mobile phone. 
They also not particularly must control, which music formats can process a mobile phone or a Player. 
MP3 create will be everyone, and most music that you get, straight in this format. 
The format belonged to spread can play back that most, and moreover most devices also music in the WMA format. 
Less AAC (a format, the Apple and its iPods use) is usual. 
Better mobile phones enable also the purchase of music Online. 
One needs to call only the corresponding sides of a provider (or another supplier) over Internet mobile, and one already can acquire a song or album. 
This service can already on and for itself a striking argument be why one should gain himself a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately the offer of the provider is bad and is restricted mostly only to fast radio hits. 
The prices are not also the lowest. 
Generally however one assumes that straight this type of the sale of music (would be it over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will control the music industry. 
That carry the mobile phone with itself. 
If you have desire to sound somewhat, grasp forget lies after the mobile phone in the jacket pocket, during the Players at home. 
It depends however whether you carry also always headphones or at least a wireless absolve arrangement with itself. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker, control almost each mobile phone that, but only the least MP3-Player. 
The probably largest advantage of the music mobile phones will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand crowns. 
For three and four thousand crowns, you get already an entirely respectable Walkman. 
The largest Handicap will be for that that no normal headphones are there. 
The best and technically most matured telephones with a 3,5-mm-Ãffnung for normal headphones cost up to five ten thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the Players lies again in the easy operation. 
The simplest - and unconditionally cheapest (see selection) - Player everyone cannot serve really. 
A minimum at functions, the resemblance in the operation with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or for example the turntable is obvious. 
It threatens no collision in form of an erroneously engaged mobile Internet and a subsequently horrendous calculation for data transmissions. 
After which device one should grasp now 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) control as a rule a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD and Ã¤.). 
Also if you buy later a corresponding card, two thousand crowns suffice. 
Yet attention. 
In the basis models, as a rule only cards with a maximal capacity of 2 GB are supported. 
Only the most expensive can read also 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If you want to possess already a mobile phone and want to buy yourself another low-priced MP3-Player, grasp you after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to put then more than 1100 crowns on the table. 
If belong to the more demanding listeners, take dear specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent serve buttons for MP3, and the serve comfort comes so at that of a single MP3-Players up to. 
Furthest Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones have out of the series Walkman the same user interface like the individually sold MP3-Player, is here. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long rechargeable battery service life (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours) MP3-Player of the manufacturer named above perform you. 
The first virtual supplier comes already this year to the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic quite is matured, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services on how they are offered also by its partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless something is missing here - a virtual supplier that forces the classic to lower praising. 
Perhaps this will wait let no longer long for itself. 
That the Czech mobile phone suppliers to the most expensive in Europe work generally, about that we have already often on mobile. cz reported. 
This also the telecommunication authority confirmed made by the way that aware that the price is higher for a SMS here than in the remainder of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European commission in the area regulation of the roaming fees it comes so probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone suppliers will be SMS out of foreign countries cheaper than at home. 
How does it come compare to are so high, that the prices in the Czech Republic in that Europe? 
The answer is simple, it is missing the competition that makes really a declaration of war. 
Perhaps sounds it paradoxically, gives in the Czech Republic it yet three mobile phone networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone suppliers scold on the other hand gladly about the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market. 
The pflichtet often also the chairperson of the advice of the Czech telecommunication authority Pavel by, that often had expressed in the past, that there would be no place in the Czech Republic for a further supplier. 
It agrees probably that a classic supplier with an own network has no longer particularly many chances (by the way would become it probably also hardly yet frequencies find). 
There is however another possibility - a virtual supplier. 
Just the entrance of virtual supplier on the mobile phone market entailed a clear mark-down on which then also the classic mobile phone suppliers had to react. 
At the same time there was mobile or Virgin mobile before the entrance of such firms such as Tesco on the market in Great Britain similar voices such as in the Czech Republic. 
It appeared however that there is for such suppliers place and that these can be really successful. 
By the way one needs to not to search long for examples. 
We reported in February this over the start of the virtual supplier mobile King in Poland. 
In only a year of half it succeeded this supplier to win more than 100 thousands of customer and to climb so to the five largest supplier of the country. 
Behind mobile King, the finance group Penta, that in the Czech Republic stands at the same time among other things U: fon possesses. 
The advantage of virtual supplier exists at the same time therein that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. 
In order to be able to function effectively, need virtual suppliers namely much of less customer than a classic supplier. 
They need namely no relatively high costs for the building, the business and the support of a mobile network. 
In the world, so the virtual suppliers profiare themselves normally as a Low-Cost-firms out - it offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS what is accompanied to be sure often by a less extensive service offer. 
So Tesco mobile in Great Britain SMS offers for example cheaper at least around the half at than its competitors. 
How however the example of mobile King in Poland shows, it can be also a right good gambit to set on a not clichÃ©-ridden target group. 
This supplier directs itself namely specifically to men. 
"Real fellows select mobile King - the supplier, that them pleases and that it trust can", so David Seibert, the CEO of the Entertainment company mobile, the operator firm of this virtual supplier. 
Heavily to say whether a similar draft could get a such as in Poland also in the Czech Republic foothold. 
On that doubts also the press officer of Vodafone Miroslav. "The Czech market is for a market segment, on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small. 
Moreover it is from the viewpoint the service offer relative gesÃ¤ttigt." 
In the Czech Republic hopeless, mean the mobile phone suppliers 
It is not certain however almost that, if a virtual mobile phone supplier the Czech Republic conquers, this mobile King be becomes. 
"We do not dissuade see to be sure of an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations particularly hopeful. 
It will come sooner to a market entrance of mobile King in other countries of our region", says in a telephone conversation for mobile. cz Jana press officer of the finance group Penta. 
Indirectly it confirmed so that the present mobile phone suppliers in the Czech Republic are not inclined particularly to this thought. 
In the opposite, they try to do all for that that no potential competitor emerges. 
Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone supplier shows already for some time time the group GTS Novera that would like to undertake a further step in order to become a real competitor of TelefÃ³nica O2 in the area of firm customer. 
"We have a large interest on that to offer our customer not only cable network, but rather also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen. 
And the earlier, the better. 
Over this possibility, we negotiated repeatedly with all Czech mobile phone suppliers. 
With some of them, we were able to reach already negotiation progress", so the press officer of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times come. 
Out of not official information follows that the first virtual supplier is to be expected perhaps until end of the year. 
Until now however this is surrounded of an unÃ¼berwindbaren wall of the being quiet. 
"In this moment we do not assume that in the Czech Republic place exists for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market shows large specific characteristics vis-Ã -vis other markets. 
Until now addressed us yet no subject with a complex and serious project in this area", means in its explanation for mobile. cz Vlastimil out of the press department of TelefÃ³nica O2. 
On the Spezifik of the Czech market, also further suppliers refer. 
The press officer of T mobile Martina KemrovÃ¡ adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: "Until now we found yet no viable and two-sided advantageous project, construct one on that further kÃ¶nnte." 
And it adds: "In the network of T mobile hardly a virtual supplier will emerge until end of the year. 
In this moment, we would have to exist have already a concrete offer to be able to think around so short-termed." 
Vodafone arranges its attention sooner on the fulfillment of the requests of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav means in addition: "For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, especially in the area division of costs and infrastructure. 
We regard just this from the viewpoint the customers as the best. 
The head strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided network for an Internet fast mobile." 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The action of the mobile phone supplier is to be understood easily, a further supplier would be named more competition, this would become sinking praising and through it also to a decline of the profits lead. 
Why should therefore one ease the market entrance for such a competitor? 
That the suppliers can pull at a cord, if it concerns somewhat, covers also the long back and forth around the origin of U: fon. 
The probably strongest pressure toward came at present when U came: fon on the market, from the company T mobile. 
Also the publicly accessible information of that covers that. 
Now however just U suits itself: fon as an argument why one should not allow a virtual supplier. 
Martina KemrovÃ¡ noted in addition: "The competition background of the mobile phone market was strengthened recently moreover yet through the market entrance of a fourth mobile phone supplier. 
Under consideration of the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech republic is place obvious, that a new participant requests high at the market even and above all its services wÃ¼rde." 
In view of this Herangehensweise of the mobile phone supplier, the absolute the interest of the Czech regulating authorities amazes to be sure. 
It does not concern has at the same time not only the bearing of that that in Czech unfortunately - in the difference to Great Britain and further highly developed countries - the competence to interfere into the economic competition. 
This possesses excluding the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÃOHS). 
This however related its entirely typical bearing to this total problematic nature. 
"The market entrance of a virtual mobile phone supplier would be then possible after it came to a contract conclusion between a mobile phone supplier and a virtual supplier over the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. 
Until now was locked was no such contract, for the offer of potential interested parties probable for the classic suppliers not sufficiently interesting", so in its answer on our inquiry KristiÃ¡n Chalupa of the department outside relations of the ÃOHS. 
Of representatives of the supplier, such a formulation would not surprise. 
Of an authority, that represent the consumer interests and should among other things on that eighth, that no one abuses its position on the market, is this more than doubtful. 
Especially, if KristiÃ¡n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual suppliers work very normally, is to be observed, contributed that its market entrance to a mark-down in mobile telephone services hat." 
Probably however the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a mark-down do not belong to the interests of the ÃOHS. 
Really shocking the almost already moving harmony of the three mobile phone supplier that results from its reactions is at this case. 
The question whether it concerns really only a chance, lies on the hand. 
Just as the absolute same gasoline price is certain in the gas station only chance and the consequence of a hard competition. 
"The authority no sign at all discovered in this thing, that point out an actions arranged against the competition, and therefore it has also no reason to interfere on any type into the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, therefore it has not also the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market. 
The necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual suppliers are missing probably also the regulating authority for telecommunication", led Chalupa in its explanation on. 
The interpretation of the dominating position on the market is one of many debatable points. 
Naturally there is is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared of that after the telecommunication from the viewpoint the economic competition a single market. 
On such a market, none of the Czech mobile phone suppliers possesses then naturally a dominating position. 
Some right experts however offer another visibility manner - for the market entrance of a virtual supplier is always the approval of the network operator necessary. 
And the mobile phone suppliers has - logical would prove - the monopoly for its network. 
That means that it takes in a dominating position in a certain segment of necessity. 
Even if one does not go along however with this argumentation, it should be for the ÃOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone suppliers incidentally similarly advance. 
At the same time troubles of a row of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) cover that they bump in negotiations with all suppliers into very similar hindrances. 
The AbwÃ¤lzung of the responsibility on that is then in the telecommunication services a quite usual trick with which the ÃOHS of the entire matter dissociates itself. 
This was to be observed already in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately it is not arrive to put through in the novel dismissed recently of the telecommunication law the expansion of the competences the on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunication although a row by specialists had promised itself therefrom an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives of the ÃOHS must know that only all too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It goes already if no one views there 
Unnoticed the functioning of any pseudovirtueller supplier, of which it gives several in the Czech mobile phone networks immediately, remains first once. 
Firms, that issue own prices lists for mobile telecommunication services, are, that are only partly public however. 
Normally it concerns namely firms, that act in the area Multilevel marketing. 
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia telecom, Starlife and other. 
The prices lists of these firms arrive normally only at selected. 
The joke of the thing exists therein that the firm appears vis-Ã -vis the operator as a classic firm customer, who orders a large quantity at SIM cards. 
As an important customer, he receives then special quotations (and other offers). 
The problem exists therein that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone suppliers forbid a similarly natured resale. 
"Should it cases give, that you describe, can it itself around an injury of the contractual conditions act, with which we us then busy become, what a termination of the collaboration with the corresponding company lead can", answered Martina KemrovÃ¡ on our question to this problem. 
It is to be sure quite unlikely that so something does not get around in the responsible of the mobile phone supplier. 
Especially in the case of the three mentioned firms, it can concern thousands of customer. 
No operator opposes however such an action. 
Out of the activity of these firms, profits to be neglected do not flow in them namely, simultaneously are impaired it - in the difference to the actual virtual suppliers - not through the actual official marketing. 
On possible problems, Miroslav makes attentively: "The law enabled be used such types of speculations, in spite of everything the services of these firms only of a very slight percentage of the customers. 
These must accept in addition that the SIM card in its telephone does not run on its name, they can order therefore not full about that like the normal customers of the mobile phone supplier." 
Already alone that however at least strangely would have to occur that. 
Moreover a further question opens itself for the ÃOHS. 
The lock mobile phone suppliers block themselves before such an action the eyes, why it against a virtual supplier? 
It is to be added that the ÃOHS has to the disclosure of such activities quite strong competences, and if it does not want, it must not itself with the explanation of the supplier, they would know nothing therefrom and its business conditions would become this forbid, satisfied give. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer most expensively 
How in the text already repeatedly emphasized became, the market entrance of virtual supplier entailed a clear price decline in the different services. 
At the same time have practically in all countries where virtual suppliers emerged, that tries classic supplier, whose origin practically more or few to prevent. 
That of them used were arguments practically identical - a to smaller, and/or to very satiated market, problem in the quality of the services etc. 
In the advanced countries however the regulation organs interfered just in these moments, that tried to preserve in no way the interests of the mobile phone supplier, but rather that of its customers. 
If let it be not through formal measures or formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator emerged, and this followed further. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulation organs throw themselves the entire case to like a hot potato. 
Do not come from our experiences we can eliminate ourselves the impression that vagueness in the competences in these cases is favorable more than. 
Yet we do not throw the gun into the grain. 
If the background information agrees and soon a virtual supplier will emerge, the Czech mobile phone market will set itself perhaps soon again in motion. 
If a supplier allows the origin of a virtual mobile phone supplier, the ÃOHS will not remain idle if it goes therefore to reject (to discriminate) further interested parties. 
And the Czechs more expensively will telephone then finally no longer than the remainder of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Sound the four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday prime minister Mirek TopolÃ¡nek introduced is on the occasion of the day of the Czech national-ness in a celebration hour the new receptions of the national anthem where my homeland. 
The hymn became newly of the orchestra of the national theater under the direction of balanced out. 
Four versions are available - with masculine or feminine solo song, in choir frame and in an instrumental version. 
The song frame received and Adam Plachetka. 
The examiners of the hymn versions are Otakar JeremiÃ¡Å¡ and Jaroslav. 
On the server iHNed. cz, you can listen to immediately all four versions. 
For the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymn. 
Already earlier it had said the Czech broadcast, it had selected for the solos variants singer with young, representative voices, who are chosen marked and. 
"From the beginning have I in both and then also with the choir tries, a clear diction to keep, so that one the text well understands, so that a harmony emerges", so the conductor. 
The Czech national anthem will commit next year its 175th anniversary. 
The song Kde domov erklang for the first time 1834 on the stage of the standing theater in the originally Czech piece of Josef KajetÃ¡n Tyl, that music came of FrantiÅ¡ek Å kroup. 
It became popular, and the persons took it spontaneously on. 
The first Strophe of the song became then after the origin of Czechoslovakia in 1918 an organic component of the national anthem. 
It remained one of the seven country symbols also after the origin of the independent Czech republic. 
How the "new" hymn sounds 
The citizens of Prague traffic businesses convey on Wednesday for the first time also on a chip 
The Wednesday, that 1st of October 2008, will go in into the story of the citizen of Prague traffic businesses as a date, at which into a SUBWAY, streetcar or a bus the first passengers get into, that carry an electronic certificate in the pocket instead of a paper ticket. 
These can buy itself presently about one hundred thousand person, who possess the chip card Opencard. 
The passengers can a 30-Tage-, a 90-Tage- or a year certificate (validly as of 1 January 2009) buy themselves and deploy let this simultaneously on its chip card, and to be sure in the information centers and branch places of the traffic businesses at the U-train-stations Muzeum, getÅ¡ovice, Roztyly, Kobylisy, RajskÃ¡ zahrada, and Luka. 
The certificates are since yesterday also over the Internet on the sides of the traffic businesses www.dpp.cz available. 
The service was used into the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers. 
That that use the Internet sale really can forget the edition window in the U-train-stations where they had to wait until now regularly in long snakes for its paper tickets. 
They buy the certificate namely over Internet, deployed becomes this on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branch places of the city library. 
"At these places is available the traveler also a switch with educated personnel, that interested parties in the Internet purchase advises and also the certificate on the card deploys", so the speaker of the project Martin OpatrnÃ½. 
Next to the libraries, one can deploy can the electronic certificates also at self-service vending machines on the Opencard, that are mounted in some U-train-vestibules. 
How do such vending machines look? 
They are red, remind one of ticket canceler, the passengers have it perhaps already in the U-train-stations Roztyly, 1ST P. Pavlova, Florenc and VltavskÃ¡ notes. 
"Presently gives it in the city five therefrom, until end of the year should it however eighty be", joins OpatrnÃ½ thereto. 
The certificate a vending machine controls instead of the driver 
The operation of the vending machines that will function from tomorrow is simple. 
One must introduce only the chip card, and the certificate acquired previously plays itself by even up. 
The electronic certificates count from tomorrow not only in the capital, but rather also in the environment. 
Therefore in the suburb trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which above all the inhabitants arrive out of communities of the region means bohemian into the capital. 
"In the trains, that to the citizen of Prague integrated traffic belong, have the conductors harvest devices, with which it the validity duration of the certificate after time and zone test can", explains Filip DrÃ¡pal of the organization Ropid the ticket inspection. This organization assembles the schedules for the citizens of Prague traffic businesses. 
Card harvest devices have the suburb penance at the cash register at the driver. 
In the getting into, the chip card must be shown not only at the driver, but rather the Opencard is to be designed at a marked place at the side of the cash register. 
Therewith the driver controls the validity of the deployed certificate. 
"Wants a passenger the validity of the deployed certificate review, is nothing simpler, than the driver around these information to ask", so DrÃ¡pal. 
A passenger, that does not go with suburb penances and knows no longer, when the validity of the certificate ends, can go again to the self-service vending machines where the certificates are deployed on the card. 
Here the information is indicated to the validity of its documents on the display of the device. 
The Sudetens demanded of the USA a referendum 
The Sudeten German had requested in 1945 around the incorporation of the BÃ¶hmerwaldes at the United States. 
This follows out of a letter, that stores in the collections of the south bohemian scientific library. 
If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With such a wish, 1945 should have turned some groups of Sudeten German to the US president. 
This follows among other things out of a letter, that is been preserved in a private archive and that is stored today in the collections of the south bohemian scientific library. 
The German of Krumau asks the American president in the letter, he should not permit the return of the "Sudetengaus" - that on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler taken in became - at Czechoslovakia. 
"We have the situation correctly understood and want us actual the words be certain, that the American units not as an oppressor and enemies German territory enter, but rather as a deliverer", is named it in a letter, that with the words "persons whom the fate of the Sudetens is lies" signs at the heart. 
Because the connection lets assume the Sudeten German - in knowledge of the Czech national character - at Czechoslovakia, that they would expect brutality, inconsiderateness, the lack of understanding, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to receive for today and forever the protection domination over the BÃ¶hmerwald. 
"We cannot believe, that you without consideration on the view of a quarter million inhabitant this zone a country strange for us communicate, that minority suppresses and to remove tried and purely nothing at all to the victory of the allies contributed has", is to be read in the letter. 
The reason why the authors cannot sign, is alleged the fear of RachegelÃ¼sten of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president doubt about of the attitude of the BÃ¶hmerwalddeutschen would cultivate, let it be sufficiently if it would initiate in the BÃ¶hmerwaldgau a referendum about that, whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or wanted to live under the protection domination of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter somewhat naively likes to sound in current knowledge of the postwar story, it draws however in the opinion of some time witnesses a good picture with respect to the at that time expectations of the Sudeten German. 
Also if the bohemian German at least had to suspect, that one would negotiate over its deportation out of the republic, vouched itself only few of them such a possibility generally. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudetens a type autonomy. 
Again others believed, they could remain simple in Czechoslovakia. 
Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa that comes from Budweis confirms that. 
It was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy at the Baltic Sea. 
When it came at the end of the war into British captivity and one brought it into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of German further bohemian to it came, it should teach them Czech. 
"You believed, if it would come home, would become them the Czech too would fit come", so Chalupa. 
No one the German war prisoners, who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, calculated according to its opinion therewith that one would banish it on the basis of the BeneÅ¡-decrees out of the republic. 
If you do not think - then pay! 
An emotion loaded campaign directs itself to driver 
Most expensive action to the security on the streets in the Czech story. 
Also so the emotion loaded medium campaign could be characterized, that wants to start the transportation ministry on Wednesday. 
The authority of minister AleÅ¡ promises itself therefrom to divert driver of dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, in the radio, in the movie theater, on the Internet, but also on Flyern. 
It should the drivers of to fast method and alcohol at the tax divert. 
Remember and it also on that, itself before trip start anzugurten. 
The campaign wants above all young drivers, motorcyclist, pedestrian and not finally also occupation motorists into the conscience speak. 
And what shown becomes in the Spots? 
Above all stories of persons that appeal at emotions. 
Therefrom also the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign witnesses: 
If you do not think - then pay! 
The words "do not think" stand in large letter on a mark sign. 
And in a Blutlache, the word stands "would pay" then. 
This should mean that one can pay a moment inattention with the own life. 
The Spots become "shock" the spectators until 2010. 
The ministry let inspire itself of similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries where one can see very normally pictures with drastic receptions of accident victim. 
It promises itself therefrom that so the accident numbers and the amount of the traffic dead decrease to the Czech streets. 
The Spots were assembled of the agencies Euro RSCG. 
Sugar bread and whip for the drivers 
"For the drivers the motto counts sugar bread and whip. 
Sugar bread means that they go, if it for example in red, save time. 
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must become at the risk remembered", so the traffic psychologist of the hospital well Homolce Martin. 
And therefore information campaigns in the press is and above all negative advertising necessary, means the psychologist. 
Already less are effective its opinion after chalkboards, that the drivers make aware of a danger. 
"Places one a static chalkboard up, that before a danger warns, becomes this probably soon with the environment blend, and the drivers become it no longer perceive", means. 
Olmert would return almost all occupied zones in the exchange for peace 
The chairperson of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return practically all zones, that were occupied 1967, therefore also the Jordanland, east Jerusalem and the Golan heights if one could close peace with Palestine and Syria in the exchange for that. 
It emphasized this in an interview, that was printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot. 
"We must to an agreement with the Palestinians arrive, what means, that it necessary becomes, almost all (occupied) zones to return, if not quite all", said Olmert vis-Ã -vis the newspaper. 
"We retain a conscience percentage of these zones, but we become at the Palestinian a similarly high percentage (Israeli zone) lecture must, because it without this no peace give becomes", joined it thereto. 
It cleared that a possible return also east Jerusalem would comprise. 
"That, that security in Jerusalem wants and above all does not want, that tractors or bulldozer over its legs roll, how it one of my best friends happens is, becomes on a part of Jerusalem forgo must", Olmert noted in allusion two attacks in the city in July, with which several persons were killed and dozens of persons were injured. 
After words of the premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple Bern and holy and historic places", that lie on the territory of the old town. 
"That, that uprightly wants to receive the Israeli sovereignty over the total city, will have to integrate 270,000 Arabians. 
That will not function", strengthened it further. 
Deduction of the Golan heights 
Olmert expressed itself for a deduction of Israel of the Golan heights, what in its opinion an indispensable condition is for the conclusion of a peace contract with Syria. 
This would require however also certain exertions on sides of Damascus. 
"My suggestion reads not, with Syria only and alone on the basis of a deduction of the Golan heights peace to close", strengthened Olmert. 
"The Syrier know only all too well whereon they must renounce in order to recover the Golan heights. 
They will have to forgo its present relation to the Iran; they will have to forgo its relation to the (Shiite) Hisbollah movement; they will have to forgo the permanent support, grant that it the terrorism of that (Shiite) Hamas movement, that terror network al Khaida and the jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", concretized the prime minister. 
Ask about the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal? 
The law does not know is not allowed it, in a distance coach the Umherlaufen 
In connection with the tragic accident of a penance of the company student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua the question stands whether steward and traveler may run here during the trip in the bus there and. 
"Wanted we strictly and formally the law keep, contradicts the activity of a steward the law over the traffic", so the speaker of the transportation ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, with which last week a twenty-two twenty-two year-old stewardess came around life, was caused probably of the driver of the truck, who crossed the bus the way. 
The young woman sat in this moment to all misfortune next to the driver, on that at the least certain place in the vehicle although she still had two further places to the decree. 
A bus can have or sharply brake an accident however also in the moment, expedites the steward coffee or newspapers in that. 
A roll plays also whether the bus is equipped according to the vehicle letter also with state places. 
If this is not planned in the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The distance coaches of student Agency have no state places; what the director confirmed vis-Ã -vis the firm, Radim. 
"This we discussed with the ministry, and this did not agree first the movement of traveler. 
Later one turned back this, and we arrived at a consent according to what the travelers may go during the trip on the toilet, if it its seat have", divided he its standpoint with. 
The law knows no steward 
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation for the roll of a steward - no legal specification describes this roll. 
There is to be sure also no legal specification that forbids it the carrier to furnish services. 
The law over the traffic knows only the term vehicle companion; its right and duties does not define it however", joins the speaker of the ministry Hanzelka unambiguously thereto. 
The director of the department of street vehicles the transportation ministry Josef PokornÃ½ on the other hand means that the law retroactively uncovers this problematic nature. 
"It depends whether the bus has in the product allowance of also state places. 
That is then all", emphasizes it. 
Penance subdivide itself in city penance where there are state places and the maximum speed is restricted, local traffic penance with state places and a higher permitted speed and distance coaches without state places with the highest allowable speed and seats, that are equipped with security belts. 
How in the airplane, says the expert 
The BESIP expert for traffic security Jaroslav sees a penance in the movement of steward on board no basic problem. 
"In a fluid method many dangers, the situation do not threaten is comparable with the service on board an airplane. 
Also here is not certain when turbulences come, and the stewardess can the head knock itself." 
"A bus brakes however sharply, count naturally also the laws of the physics. 
Just as in the city bus or in a streetcar. 
The security of the steward must clarify the carrier through internal directions", says it and means also that this problematic nature is not solved from the viewpoint the law completely. 
is ready to paint the services 
Student Agency offers as the only bus firm services of steward. 
The firm busies about two hundred persons in this function. 
The director does not look at its occupation also after the accident as risk pregnant. 
"As soon as I get however the impression, that the occupation of the steward is risk pregnant, will paint I it. 
The travelers can receive coffee and newspapers in the getting into. 
That would sink also the costs", means it. 
As an interest in the security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin establishes the lack of steward in its penance. Its company operates compare to however only a fraction of lines in that student Agency. 
"We no stewardesses have defend us, on the other hand we already from the beginning. 
Earlier or later this ends with any deadly accident", had expressed it before not entirely for TÃ½den. cz to a year. 
That was an incredible tragedy 
In the accident of a line penance to Naples, a young stewardess was perished out of the region Pilsen, that had worked two years for the company. 
The Slovenian truck was turned probably without blinking of the standing strip and had blocked the bus the trip. 
The driver of the penance tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, collided however with the right front part with the truck. 
That the two places had been for the stewards sold, challenges. 
"These places cannot be reserved in distance connections, they are blockiert." 
Firm wants to accuse truck driver. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the judgement, expects a financial compensation it however also of sides of the indebted. 
A change in the law? 
Not in visibility 
A more exact regulation of the movement of steward on board a penance a legal regulation could bring, at which a thirty headed expert team of the transportation ministry works already over a year. 
"This to be sure arrived yet at no concrete end. 
Penance stand also not unconditionally on the order of the day, sooner the point system, the maximum speed on the freeway and the use of mobile phone in the trip", so expert. 
"The transportation ministry regards the activity of the steward not as something, that the security of the travelers substantially endanger could", so Hanzelka whereby the inspection of the security of the penance lies in the competence of the police and the labor safety authorities. 
DÃ¼sseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt 
At large words, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB board of directors at the colleagues of the house. 
Through a bringing together of units the DÃ¼sseldorfer money institute with that Frankfurt Deka bank "the central money market house of the savings bank finance group" could emerge, is named it in the letter well known become on Monday. 
The WestLB would bring in a "competence block" with persistent yield power into such a business. 
And generally such a connection could be the decisive impetus to further alliance lungs in the country bank sector. 
So it reads if a board of directors in difficult time wants to demonstrate action capacity. 
For the marred WestLB is as always under powerful pressure. 
Not only on the part of the EU commission, but rather also through the federal agency for finance service supervision, that made clear that state government North Rhine-Westphalian not until recently, that would press time to find a future solution. 
Of one like always natured connections between the Deka bank, that know savings bank customer because of its Investmentsfonds, and the WestLB has been to be sure already for some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. 
To be sure Deka-bank-boss Franz Waas has know let the end of August in the model of the half year numbers, in a fusion of the house at the Mainzer country road with a country bank, about the Helaba or the WestLB, would see he no sense. 
Yet the supervisory board of the Deka, that is carried ever to the half by the country banks and the savings bank associations, that board of directors delegates has to lead with the WestLB discussions about joint business activities. 
At the same time it could concern the money market business or parts therefrom. 
The conversations have to be sure, is named begun it at the finance place, just recently. 
Of the Deka bank, that is with its 3000 colleagues among the more important employers at the finance place Frankfurt, the speech is not for the first time if it concerns consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
It looked 2003 a moment long so, as could the Deka bank with the country bank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba merge. 
Out of this threefold alliance, became nothing however. 
Hardly the plans had become public, spoke themselves the Hessian state government against a participation of the Helaba on that from. 
Also the two other houses found then not together. 
The country bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of its at the country bank Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Stuttgart. 
Yet there was again and again thought game over a connection of the Deka bank with country banks. 
Finally GÃ¼nther Merl, chairman of the board of the Helaba had expressed itself to be sure, against simulations over a going together with its house. 
Independently therefrom the insight seems to ripen however that a moving together of the different houses of the publicly legal sector need does. 
After now the Regional Diet Election in Bavaria is past, a connection of the BayernLB with the country bank Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg could nearer move first. 
For the Helaba, that is not unconditional a good message. 
The pressure to further fusions should go climbing, its gradually the partners for that from. 
In the south, it would be nurmehr junior partner although it has previously by far better stood through the finance crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
The savings bank association and endorsement association Hesse Thuringia, that is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba, advanced a going together with the west LB again, beginning of the year a bar. 
If remained in any case the norths LB. 
Such geostrategical considerations are however only the one side. 
On the other, it concerns the question how the different business models of the single houses fit to each other. 
In June Merl expressed, that decisive question, with which business model the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed, savings bank association and endorsement association had been answered by the German not yet. 
At the end, also a dismantling could stand the west LB, that not even speaking is wished to be sure there. 
So the speech is would be striven for then also in the letter of the board of directors there therefrom, it in any case a "total solution" for the house. 
How the units single with the going together with the Deka bank lets bring under a hat, yet will appear. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is as an "Italian weekend" well known 
For Elena, it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
Yet this time is Elena as its friend with there, and so let all be differently, says it. 
Behind them, in the five-liter-beer-keg of the sign emperor, a massively more constructed more bearded stands and proves produce can the about 200 Oktoberfest traveler, what deep tones its throats. 
Elena gives Luca first a pat, then a kiss. 
Out of Bologna, they came after Verona. 
Of here, the bus parking lot next to the railway station Puorta Nuova, start at this evening around 23.45 clock four penances, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival presumably 6.30 clock. 
Three penances are reserved above all the Italians, travel in a bus excluding Brazilian. 
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing next to its flag already, celebrated have it already in the night. 
And so loudly, says Marco Guarda, that would be nothing for Italian. 
Marco, the one long coat with fur imitation lining and some glasses with wide silver ironing carry, belong the penance. 
For five years they go are to the Oktoberfest, three tours it alone this year. 
At night there, during the day on the Wiesn, around 22.30 clock back. 
Spending the night would mean only unnecessary expenses, says Marco. 
The trip, the welcome drink with emperor beer costs 75 Euro, brewed loyal the Bavarian purity law, that health insurance and the German-speaking trip direction - Marco has in Frankfurt a language course visits - inclusive. 
And already roll the penance into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero". 
There is not no beer, yet. 
Fast it becomes quiet in the bus, that sleep traveler. 
Goods so, it its powers yet will need. 
Salaries becomes in Brixen and in wood churches where also some other penance with Italian marks insert a recess at the freeway 8 shortly before Munich once again. 
When Marcos group arrives in the end according to plan around half seven o'clock in the early on the parking lot nearly the Theresienwiese, Europe stand there already at that 50 other penance out of entirely. 
Elena, Luca and the other gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan. 
First: Mount the yellow cap. 
On that "Oktoberfest" stands to the left, in fracture, in addition the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando. it". 
Secondly: "If the doors to the beer tent rise, is named it run!", calls Marco in the morning in. 
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the rear part of the tent. 
"Not ahead, otherwise block we, and not all yellow caps on the same banks, in the room distribute!" 
The measures, roars Marco, would cost 8.25 Euro. 
Do not forget and tip. 
"The security people show that we behave well! 
As soon as its the places leaves, they are away!" 
Third: "Tonight points half eleven again here appear!" Understood? 
And already it goes to the Wiesn. 
Underway ties a yellow cap as a way sign to the trees, at signs of and even at the choice placard a large Bavarian People's Party. 
One wants to be armed for the withdrawal. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende when "Italian weekend" well known. 
There are not exact details about numbers; the speech is of 50,000, that get going over the Alps and occur into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitor are supposed to have traveled this weekend extra from Italy. 
The citizens of Munich police is reinforced through seven policemen out of south Tyrol, support cover Italian voluntary helpers the Bavarian Red Cross that leads a nation statistics, in that the Italians before Britons (about 60 uses) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical provisions the first place. 
Especially popularly with Italians, the HofbrÃ¤uzelt is. 
Sleepless nights for creditor of the Hypo actually Estate 
The German bank system had passed relatively stable, emphasized Federal Ministers of Finance Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck not until that week. 
Like well that the politician also yet interlaced the word "relatively" related and, that the German bank sector would not be spared by the crisis-like developments. 
For that entered at the weekend now. 
The citizen of Munich noted in the Dax Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo actually Estate (HRE) receives a billion credit by a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself of the turbulences at the markets. 
A person trusted with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the credit aids amounted to themselves on up to 35 billion Euro. 
The Hypo actually Estate paid interest on only the part, that it would use also. 
The money comes both of private like also publicly legal banks. 
Losses are background at the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had re-financed itself according to a newspaper report for long milling machine projects, for which it lent money, extremely short-termed - what possible is because of the mistrust at the markets in the meantime no longer. 
In the first half year 2008, the bar reserve of the bank had shrunk around 95 percent on 2.37 million Euro, also the equity quota had given way easily of 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The running yields and the net yields out of finance businesses had fallen vis-Ã -vis the same period last year on zero, that decreased yields out of attribution to demands and certain securities as well as out of the solution of reserves in the credit business around more than 70 percent to 5 million Euro. 
Only thanks to higher yields out of reimbursements of after stored settlement costs out of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as out of the reimbursement from interests to of the duty order and out of the business care for group business, still had moderately fall out let the yield minus with approximately 16 percent. 
That formerly Staatsfinanzierer had itself after its denationalization in 1990 first of all with commercial real estate credit verspekuliert, that had been excluded then in the Aareal bank. 
Because one earned in the classic country financing too little, the Depfa had grown stronger engaged then in infrastructure projects and the financing of partnership projects of private investors and the country (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo must become undertake actually Estate now write-offs, have the one "essential material effects" on the winning and loss calculation of the group, be named it quite undetermined. 
Fact is that the dividend was painted. 
Already for 2007, it had been shortened around two-thirds. 
Estate real the Hypo an important country and Infrastrukturfinanzierer is since the Depfa acceptance. 
It is stronger than other institutes of the refinancing at the Interbankenmarkt dependent because it has no customer enclosures. 
With the breakdown of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the credit award is again extensively failed under the banks because the banks stockpile its liquidity. 
The Hypo actually Estate means short-term the Depfa to the refinancing needs annually the credit portfolio for a part - approximately 50 billions of Euro -. 
After communication of the Hypo actually Estate, the financing requirement of the group with the credit is covered in the near future and is shielded the business "of the influence of the presently extensively function incapable international money markets". 
Out of other sources is to be heard that thanks to the moneys the refinancing would be certain by the end of 2009. 
The HRE chairman of the board Georg radios explained, on the other hand that the Hypo must would use actually Estate Group the money markets in the near future no longer. 
German Federal Bank and the federal agency for finance service supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo real Estate group would be certain now. 
That stands to hope for stockholders and creditor of the bank. 
But in view of the dynamics and imponderables of the crisis, there is probably no certainty. 
It is even not unthinkable that the financing must not be used full circumference in. 
But also the opposite is not auszuschleiÃen. 
After at the late Sunday evening the accounts after the bank before the insolvency stood, also the at least preliminary rescue is not able to do to calm the minds. 
The share price breaks around 75 percent on 3.30 Euro on. 
Right well the loan courses hold themselves on the other hand. 
Appear WÃ¤hren the priority guilt hardly moved, give the courses of the after ranks loans more clearly after. 
Concerned are the loans the earlier daughter firm WÃ¼rttemberg Hypo above all and understandably that over 2009 going out running times. 
If Hypo-actually-Estate-loans seem paint before a speculative plant alternative, its value containing-ness must after the clear intensification of the bank crisis and the institute itself, that had got itself with the acceptance of the Depfa the crisis not until the house, when by the stability of the international financial system dependent observed become. 
As long as the banks of issue, governments and less marred commercial banks are yet ready to the support of the system, as long as can of a time period appropriate for cancellation of the pensions gone out become. 
That enters ventures or however to hope what presently hardly yet someone - that the finance crisis is overcome in the coming 15 months. 
Yet in view of the messages skipping itself with the part nationalization, presently only a justified hope became out of the probability bordering at security. 
That would be allowed to prepare above all long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate itself from its engagements. 
Short time investors can use a final stroke nevertheless in addition to form a loss presentation for the future settlement tax payments on appreciations of later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, at the first school day at the Tachibana Highschool imagine should, catch to giggle the girls on: The German is total "kawaii"! 
What means that? 
Sylvana knows the word already out of one gas - in the new exchange put told it of Japan. 
"The school day first in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Already before the school way, I had Bammel. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and go 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, did not pass myself to the good fortune I. 
The instruction start does not seem determined at the Tachibana so exertally like here at home in Lower Saxony. 
The students drift in from eight o'clock until around twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher begins, the 'home room'. 
Yet before the instruction began, I was at the row to imagine. 
At the same time I am not at all the type, that speaks gladly before people, yet in addition before a class of 40 students. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I dressed an old skirt of my guest mother, in addition blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes. 
In this procession, I stood therefore before the pulpit and try to express all correctly: 'Sayonara where she Sylvana ...' - Sylvana am named I, come from Germany and would have birthday in a week. 
In the moment, I was very happily that I had begun already before well two years to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and waved everyone and continuously I heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew that already out of mine one gas. 
It belongs to the over vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'. 
Then I scurried quickly on my place. 
The girl next to me rather extend grinned, it found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to it. 
The remainder of the hour was tinted rather quiet, but as the gong, was stormed I regular. 
Everyone spoke in confusion and giggled and asked me holes into the belly - at the same time is to be understood it really heavy, Japanese English. 
In the recess, all its Bentos unpacked then. 
My guest mother had made me also so a Lunchbox - that is once something else as the odes of German recess breads. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad out of cucumber and algae, fruit and a type meat in the Tofumantel. 
Usually I have no pale shimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look remarkably and taste totally novel. 
Festival stands that all is really delicious. 
Naja, up to the salty inserted plums perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos are at Japanese schools not only simple lunch. 
It occurs sometimes that a girl gives a boy an even prepared Bento, that it then especially skillful arranges - in the hope to learn more closely know the boy in the Pausensnack. 
Therefrom I read in my Manga comic strip. 
I am strained once whether I can observe that here also. 
'Why calculated then Japan?', asked me my friends when I told them, that I want to go for a year in Tokyo to the school. 
I then always said: 
"Because it me now once fasziniert." 
In the end I have read already for years most dearly one gas. 
And therewith I the comic strip and the culture therein better would understand, began I also sometime to learn a little Japanese. 
For me was therefore totally clear that I had to travel sometime here. 
For I have also a Faible for tradition, customs and customs. 
And on that, one puts here large value. 
On the one hand Japan is a country of the newest technologies and trend - on the other side is it severe, disciplines and traditionally. 
And because all is organized so well, I felt here also not yet lost, also if Tokyo is the largest city, that I habe. ever seen". 
Also rats have feelings 
Does a rat or a Schabe escape is named that in danger that it perceives also fear? 
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Also much animals have feelings. 
Only how could one review whether they perceive the same, if they behave similar to we? 
In the Internet periodical "Edge" are published for several years contributions of famous scientist. 
Does SPIEGEL ONLINE present consider selected answers in a series on the question "what you to be aware without being able to prove it?" 
I do not believe that animals have perceptions and other consciousness conditions, without that I or somebody otherwise this previously prove could where we once prove can that other persons have consciousness. 
But in this case, we at least may hope because all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn to however other species and questions of the perceiving cut or very generally the consciousness, let's enter unwegsames terrain because the hardware does not agree. 
If a rat runs in danger, it does the same like many other animals: It stands dead, flees or grasps on. 
Persons behave similarly wherefrom many scientists close on a comparable subjective experiencing. 
On that I do not believe to be sure. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it hard to transfer our subjective experiencing to that of animals. 
To the one, the switching circuits associated almost always with the human consciousness close laughed since that prefrontal Cortex a (because of its participation in the short time memory and at the execution functions / control functions). 
This wide region more highly is developed in humans much than at the remaining primates and seems to be absent from other creatures completely. 
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, that depend on the prefrontal Cortex to decide under that the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and, exists therefore reason to the acceptance that the person differs even of the other primates. 
A further dramatic singularity would be allowed to lie in the linguistic nature of the person: Because a so large part of its experiencing is connected with language, is named it often, the consciousness would hang therefrom off. 
In this case, one could exclude animals. 
Yet also if consciousness would not depend on language, this certainly would influence it so that animal consciousness likes to procure be itself, how it also, probably very of that our consciousness would accrue would distinguish. 
Therefore is to be determined heavily how consciousness likes to look at other animals. 
If it yet neither measure itself, when something internal and subjective,, because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience analyze lets, places us its investigation before large problems. 
That of my executions have references to the contents of the aware experiencing, but there is beside it another further aspect of the consciousness that would be allowed to be scientifically more simply accessible. 
One could examine happens the consciousness processes of animals without consideration on its contents, and exactly that in studies over the short time memory of primates, especially by the example of the visualization. 
Yet in this extension, that Christof cook and Francis investigated cracked, one transfers himself sooner to the neural correlates of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both identically like to be or also not. 
Interestingly enough this extension emphasizes also the meaning of the prefrontal Cortex for the realization of the visualization. 
What arises now for the perceptions? 
I would cut back it on that that an emotional system such as the brain aware the fear in one its own activity is activated. 
What we designate as a "fear", is therefore the mental condition in which we find us, if the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, how physical reactions) memory covers. 
So seen are perceptions closely at the regions the Cortex bound, that price primates and especially the person. 
Connected with the linguistic nature, fine gradation of the perceiving arise because we can differentiate and categorize by means of the words and the grammar of conditions in order to attribute it next to us even also others. 
On the other hand Antonio Damasio means follow for example, that perceptions out of more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain tribe similarly Jaak Pankseep that however more concentrates on the brain tribe. 
Because this network in the course of the human evolution had not changed very, it could be involved thoroughly in gattungsÃ¼bergreifenden perceptions. 
Purely theoretically I cannot contradict that, consider it however to be unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues, would feel, what would appear with rats and persons such as fear, probably also in both cases so on: How however could one review whether rats and persons perceive the same, if they similarly behave? 
Does a Schabe escape in danger whether also it perceives fear? 
In my eyes, bare behavior resemblance yet no Erlebensgleichheit can prove. 
To be sure the neural comparison helps further: Rats and persons have similar brain tribes, pushed on the other hand not once a brain. 
Is the brain tribe but for perceptions responsible? 
And even if one could prove that for the person: How did one want to prove it with rats? 
Do I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even pushed (who knows?), perceptions have. 
But I would not know how I should prove that. 
And because its perceptions differ probably basically of that ours, (there the human consciousness on special switching circuits and on language rests), I investigate rather the emotional behavior than the emotional perceptions of rats. 
In any case progress waves here on the neural plain as far as one measures the same with rats and persons. 
How I do not investigate language and consciousness with rats, as well as not perceptions, knows I yet not whether they exist. 
One likes to consider that to be short-sighted, but I come rather ahead to run than permanent against a wall. 
I am even an emotional ware practical. 
Uefa president Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine 
The deputy prime minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would be placed soon under the direct responsibility by president and prime minister. 
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a confidence proof into the Ukraine and its capacity, the EM together with Poland to arrange", said Wasjunik. 
"That is however no amnesty for our country. 
The work began just recently and gives it in both countries yet much to do." 
In the timetable for the building or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports limp both host afterwards. 
Possibly even the number of the EM stadiums becomes of pay attention to six reduced. 
"We can waste no more time. 
We must work now with maximum speed", said the Ukrainian association PrÃ¤sident Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA becomes us constantly in mind retain." 
An even more radical step was concluded in Poland. 
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN suspended become after numerous scandals of the national Olympic committee and was replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission had met on inquiry of sport minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It does not exist "the serious danger, that the PZPN is capable, after the rules to act", said CHIRPED Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency. 
"We assured Uefa PrÃ¤sident Michel Platini in a letter, do not suffer that the preparation for the EM 2012 under that wird." 
Several Erstligisten had been convicted alone in the past season because of manipulation to the compulsion descent, had to be shifted in the end even the league start short-termed. 
Excited Dennis Quaid repulses 
It wanted rented per a new film, spoke in the interview over private - and has now annoyance with that former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete its blended Dennis Quaid as an adulterer. 
The schÃ¤umt - and repulses. 
Belated rose war in the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after its separation carry both Hollywood actor now an unsightly dispute together out of - in all public. 
Meg Ryan had expressed itself in an interview with the US periodical InStyle past week for the first time to that for the failure of the marriage to the reasons: "Dennis was me long time unfaithful, and that was very painful." 
The size of the fraud had brought it first after the separation in experience. 
Occasion for the Seelenstriptease was Ryans press work for its new film "The Women" - told becomes the story of an adultery. 
Dennis Quaids reaction to its Outing as an ungetreuer husband fell out clearly: "Terrible" let it be, said the 54-year-old of that "New York Daily News" that "Meg chews again and reworks" for the repeated time the story of our relation. 
Let it be moreover "deplorably" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack again "publicly at the pain and the upheaval remembers becomes, the one separation for each child mean." 
While Ryan lives since the separation alone, Quaid is remarried and became recently father of twins. 
And so close its testimonies with the taunt: "My life goes in any case further. 
I appreciate myself happily that I have a wonderful family, that it best geht." 
Praise for flight tickets and hotels sink 
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the preceding year. 
In Germany, flights became loud a current study even up to 50 percent cheaper. 
If flew and again more favorably became overnight stays in hotels - that is the result of a study of the trip service provider and finance service provider American express. 
The business analyzed its entry data out of the first half year 2008 and assessed a clear break-in in the second quarter after an increasing of the prices in the first quarter. 
After the prices climbed on the hotel market for years, the overnight stays in many places already reduced in price themselves. 
From January to March, the prices in 41 of 48 climbed examined European cities yet around on the average 6.9 percent in comparison with 2007. 
From April to June, the prices were however already around 3.6 percent lower than in the preceding year. 
Most clearly the trend in Paris and Rome had been where travelers before pay must 30 to 37 percent fewer than a year. 
As a cause for that American express sees the weak dollar rate that had led to a "decreasing wanderlust of American tourist". 
Also finance places such as Frankfurt or London would be concerned more strongly of the decline of the hotel prices than locations of industry such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices with a climb of 26.3 percent hold even the record in Europe. 
Also in the Flugpreisen, the trend in the first quarter showed yet towards the top: 
Because of the kerosene increase, travelers in the Economy class had to pay became on average 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel intensive long-range flights even up to 29.2 percent more expensive. 
From April to June, the prices sank were for flight tickets of the Economy class around on the average 12.5 percent in comparison with the preceding quarter, in the business that and First Class the price variations however by far slighter. 
In Germany, the prices broke yet more strongly a than in other European countries: 
From January to March, the prices had climbed around 11.9 percent, sank in the second quarter it around 23.6 percent. 
In German domestic flights the prices even halved themselves according to the study. 
Let reason for the price break-in be on the one hand the diminishing economic growth, explains the business. 
The demand in many segments of the flight trip market crumbles. 
On the other hand there are through that opuses-ski-come off, that liberalizes the air traffic between the USA and Europe, an increased competition pressure. 
Let sign of the tense situation be the deletions unprofitabler stretches in airline, as well as the high number of the airline, that in the first half year 2008 bankruptcy registered would have - alone in Europe were this 24 airlines. 
HSV strikes Gladbach 1:0 
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger becomes SV table leader. 
In the Borussia, it does not succeed Luhukay further to find a functioning eleven. 
Of Kristoffer small enlarge breach landing for national player Marko Marin. 
The Gladbacher came first late into the game and failed with a siphon due to the slat. 
Its message was formulated precise, it went it convincing over the lips. 
It knew simply that it was right. 
"We need the second gate", hissed Hermann Rieger in the cabin gear of the Hamburger arena. 
Much was not happening in the Katakomben, that concluded was half-time recess and again on its places sat that. 
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher appearance than a many a past participant. 
And so its favor also ear found at responsible place. 
Assistenztrainer Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted agreeing the thumb. 
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg boss trainer Martin Jol. 
Whose command have similarly is read: Here with gate two! 
The conversion stayed away. 
"There was today not all beautifully to regard", gave Marcell Jansen later to. 
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wished for" it "more relaxed. 
The Hamburgers have the 1:0 (1:0) the head ball hit of Mladen Petric to owe (11.); and the circumstance that very weak Gladbacher were not able to hurt the weak Hamburgers. 
"It was a dirty victory", summarized Martin Jol. 
The Hamburger SV becomes this Monday 121 years old. 
The spectators celebrated themselves at the Saturday afternoon already once even, the blue sky over the arenas and the flash table on the video wall, that expelled its society as a Klassenprimus. 
A birthday will become it without real party. 
"We know that to incorporate", said Marcell Jansen. 
It suspects that the tabular between testimony stands more for the unpredictability of the league, than for the dominance of its HSV. 
The team with its late obligated accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as the Jansen wooed away by the FC Bavaria - is found to be sure slowly, to shine is able to do it however not yet. 
"We need more flair and more Dribblings", demanded Jol. 
After the voting defeat 
At the Wall Street, the anxiety goes around. 
First messages of the failure of the rescue package admitted break the Dow Jones occasionally around 700 points. 
That was the largest point loss within one day in its story. 
Later the Dow caught itself again something. 
Against 20:30 clock, the stock exchange barometer most important worldwide with well five percent in the minus noted in 10,579 meters. 
The technology stock exchange Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in the minus about 1548 points. 
Largest loser was at this time in the Dow American express, that forfeited nearly 14 percent and the bank of America with a loss of approximately twelve percent. 
No title was able to gain. 
The shares of the bank Goldman special it gave way around nearly ten percent. 
First a few days ago large investor Warren Buffett had been involved in the business. 
In the frame of the rescue plan, the means of mortgage paper so-called rotten for the up purchase are supposed to be allocated. 
Paid will should the sum however not on a blow, but rather gradually. 
In return the country should receive stock option certificate of the finance companies, redeemed become could that in corresponding course development in order to reduce the load for the treasury. 
Share prices in Europe and USA in the downward victory 
The billion aids for banks in Europe and in the USA do not remove the doubts of the investor. 
The share price of the German large bank Hypo actually Estate crashes and tears the Daxes downward. 
The US index Dow Jones loses in spite of the planned rescue of the financial market through the country. 
Spectacular losses of the Hypo actually Estate and the Commerzbank share index (Dax) tore the German deeply into the minus. 
The share of the citizen of Munich Immobilienfinanziers lost in spite of the rescue operation of Federal Government and private banks occasionally three-quarters of its value that after gave Commerzbank around more than 20 percent. 
The Daxes slipped clearly under the psychologically important 6000-Punkte-Marke 6000-Punkte-Marke points 6000-Punkte-Marke SIGN and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent in 5,839 points. 
Worldwide the stock markets went into the knees. 
In New York, the Wall Street with clear losses opened.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim drew the 23 million new shares. 
The trade group and tourism group announced moreover that the shares are not sold in Thomas Cook. 
Dark matter influences flight of space probes 
For years a mysterious phenomenon has provided in investigation for helplessness: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so named Swing-by-maneuver. 
Experts fear that the general relativity theory Albert could be not entirely correct Einsteins. 
The space probe "Ulysses" flew almost 18 years through the space. 
Because of soon freezing fuel directions threatens its now cold death. 
Under scientists has provided for years a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-anomaly. 
The Swing by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they receive additional momentum in the gravitation field of a celestial body, about the earth. 
Through it the probes much fuel can save. 
The European American research probe Cassini Huygens used this physical trick just as as the sun probe Ulysses. 
What the researchers at the same time to be sure already since years amazed: The missiles do not behave 100-percent so how one would expect it after the venerable gravitation law. 
Rather it comes to irregularity in the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Until now the physicists were not able to explain this effect. 
They baptized it Swing-by-anomaly. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the general relativity theory Albert could not be entirely correct Einsteins, whom the attractive force of matter describes through a curve of the room. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle of the institute for Advanced Study out of Princeton believes as always firmly that Einstein did not err, and to explain tried the Swing-by-anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter, that settled astronomer in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could dark matter be, that itself also entirely in the vicinity of the earth find could", writes it. 
Of the existence of the dark matter, the space researchers know for approximately ten years. 
Of it, an attractive force goes out obviously, whose effect can be observed on other celestial bodies. 
You yourself are on the other hand totally invisibly, that is, it sends and reflected no electromagnetic radiation, especially just also no visible light. 
After the calculations of the scientist, the dark matter settles nevertheless well one-fifth of the total mass of the universe. 
In Egypt, tourist abducted are free 
After ten days in the hand of its abductors, the tourists neglected in Egypt should be again free, like the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed. 
The abductors out of the Sudan had demanded several million Euro ransom. 
In a shooting before the release, six hostage-takers should have been killed. 
In the south of Egypt, five German was abducted. 
Ransom negotiations already should run. 
Again and again run German into the visor of kidnappers. 
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases. 
The tourists neglected European in the Sahara are obviously free. 
These reported the Egyptian national television, the Arabic TV transmitter al Arabija and Italian media concurring. 
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages were freed. 
We review just its state of health", said Frattini. 
Let the five German, five Italians and a RumÃ¤nin as well as its eight Egyptian companions be well and in security, reported the Egyptian national television. 
The 19 participants of a desert sending should be already on the way to Cairo. 
Unclear remain further the backgrounds of a shooting before the release of the hostages: Accordingly the abductors had been ready according to an Egyptian security official to the termination of the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the abductor. 
"The problem was solved. 
They were with a ransom agreed", said the official. 
Let it be "only therefore gone, the hostages in reception to take" when sudden "this surprise" came. 
Sudanese soldiers had shot on Sunday in the boundary zone between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt six of the abductor and had arrested two of them. 
The hostage-takers had demanded of Germany a ransom in height of six million Euro; the money should be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The daily newspapers "els Masri el Jom" reported with reference to a German mediator, the release of the hostages would delay itself because the kidnappers feared around its security. 
According to the report the abductors want to release the feminine hostages after payment of the ransom. 
The men should as long as held become, until the abductors would have a certain flight route. 
The German message in Cairo rejected an attitude to the report. 
Abuse of the stepfather "led to the suicide" 
That abuse years-long through its stepfather led in addition that a woman killed herself, was reported to a court. 
Michael Trerise, 57, out of Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison sentence of six years after it had stood eight cases of sexual abuse. 
The punishment court in Truro learned, regularly tied up was that it its Stieftochter Stephanie Randle as it between five and seven years as. 
Trerise wrote in an admission: "I feel me responsibly for its death." 
The court learned that woman Randle in its house in Mutley, Plymouth killed herself, on the 1st of April 2007 in the age of 34. 
When it lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied up it and connected was its eyes before it carried out sexual actions, while its mother away around in a restaurant to work. 
Trerise and his wife let separate themselves in the 1980ern and pulled it after Cornwall back. 
Its Stieftochter went to Plymouth. 
The court learned however that woman Randle, that worked a large part of its time on a voluntary basis for that nationally trust, was pursued, by the abuse, that had been added its two times in the week. 
District attorney Ramsay Quaife reported the court that friends would have said, that woman Randle, that had been an enthusiastic surfer and cyclist, would be "emotionally dead" been, since 2006 and would have abandoned" "its life 
Its correct father Terrance Randle found in April 2007 it dead in its dwelling in Plymouth. 
It is supposed that she killed herself in that itself by means of a plastic sack suffocated has itself. 
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of its daughter who wrote an admission letter, that ended so: "I maintained it to tie up and its eyes to connect." 
"I it did not compel sexually. 
I feel for its death responsibly." 
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for its victim, it must been frightening be, was especially there it first seven. 
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim. 
Worse the fact yet is not that it very unlikely is, that the matter would be ended before court, if it this done hÃ¤tte." 
It added: "I notice had which effects, according to description of Stephanies father and mother, its deed over the years on its daughter. 
It would be otherwise unambiguous a very promising, successful and happy young woman gewesen." 
Officials responsible for lost data is accused 
The BBC learned that the cabinet official, the document in June exertally confidential in a train had lost, in accordance with the "public security law" accused will become. 
The man was delegated of the defense ministry when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train after Waterloo. 
The documents became deliver the BBC before they Hanseatic leagues to the police. 
There is is the weakest accusation within the law and it no reference to criminal intention. 
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said had been the action for many in Whitehall a surprise. 
It said: "You would have thought, explained that themselves therewith internally at the defense ministry and cabinet wÃ¼rde." 
The employee whose name cannot be named is accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, is concerned the clause, that himself with the certain storage of information. 
The royal district attorney's office recommended that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of its work in the joint Geheimdienstkommitee. 
The documents that it transferred contained classified estimations over al Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces. 
It was informed and was brought about the decision on Monday morning by its house at a secretly held place. 
Residential construction companies see B&B costs into the eye 
British residential construction companies costs of more could stand after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley bank than 80 million pounds into the house. 
The government made available 14 billion pounds in order to protect the enclosures of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers. 
The interests for this loan are paid of all business, that get money of investors, inclusive of the 59 building companies 
The general director of the union of the residential construction companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said, it would be "intolerable" that the companies and its members would have to pay. 
That 14 billions of loan will be repay in the end if Bradford are deleted & Bingleys credit. 
But the interests accumulated in the meantime are credited each year that 700 finance businesses, that suppose deposit. 
The program to the compensation of finance services confirmed vis-Ã -vis the BBC that the 59 residential construction companies would be contained in this number. 
It is bitterly that those institutions, that circumspect behaved have... now called become to receive around some of the costs of that institutions, that were by far less circumspect. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It said that each business in the relation would have to pay to the enclosures, that would hold it,, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs. 
The treasury appreciates that the interests are amounted to themselves for the credit on 450 million pounds in 2009. 
That is that the companies must procure 81 million pounds for the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, that general director of the union of the residential construction companies, announced the BBC that he would believe, that this would be unfair. 
It is bitterly that those institutions, that circumspect behaved have during the real estate upswing now called become to carry some of the costs by that institutions, that were by far less circumspect. 
Loud the BSA no company is failed since the existence of the records in 1945. 
"We become all aspects of this thing over the next weeks observe, over to see, which alternatives it gives, around residential construction companies and its members of possibly considerable costs to protect." 
The interests that become in 2009 due uncover the seven months of the end of September these years until the end of March. 
In 2010, interests become for a full year due and that could nearly twice as much be. 
Because building companies are two-sided organizations without company, its members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interests on savings accounts. 
Milk becomes five Pence per liter more expensive 
The persons on Jersey see themselves therewith confronted to have to pay more for its milk. 
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the large mark price of its milk around further five Pence per liter of Monday at. 
It is comes the price climb second this year, after a two Pence increase in February, and after investigations of a consultation business were carried out. 
The retailers should decide even whether they would like to transmit the price increase at its customers. 
Before the price increase in February the large mark price of Jersey milk changed finally in the year 2002. 
Bond is forbidden former prime minister of Bangladesh 
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bond petition of the former prime minister sheikh Hasina, what means, that she could be arrested, if she returns into the country. 
Your defenders said that the court bond to have blackmailed denied concerning the accusation 50 million Taka ($729,700) of a businessman, while it was prime minister. 
The case is one of several floating accusations because of corruption against it. 
Rival, Khaleda Zia, long-time political sheikh Hasinas was released beginning of this month against bond. 
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but its party that demanded Awami alliance,, that the military supported transition government should grant its freedom first of all once unrestricted. 
The correspondents say that, although its custody exposure granted became around for medical treatment abroad to go, is it in the frame of its release not clearly whether it will be able to remain further at liberty, if it returns to Bangladesh. 
Your lawyers indicate that it will appeal now court against the decision of the waiter of court at the waiter. 
"The upper court has sheikh Hasinas bond favor rejected, because it says, that it no bond granted get must, because it already on custody exposure abroad is, around abroad treated to become", said its lawyer Rafique ul Huq. 
We will register a right trouble against the upper court." 
Your lawyers object would require, that it bond around out of foreign countries into the country to return in order to prepare themselves for the choices in December. 
It would be expected that sheikh Hasina would return home after the 17th of October, said an Awami-alliance-chairman of the party on Sunday. 
It became last year arrested after the army supported transition government had received the power, had been released however in June out of the prison in order to go for medical treatments abroad. 
Both sheikh Hasina, and Khaleda Zia, all accusation points against itself deny. 
Fears around the Anti-polio-initiative in Afghanistan 
In the youngest Anti-polio-initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children were not vaccinated based on the force, that is connected with the Taliban,, so the United Nations. 
The United Nations carried out last week a vaccinate program in six provinces. 
However they not for safety reasons were able to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south. 
According to a speaker of the UN, this was the case in spite of the promise of the Taliban not to attack and/or to hinder the thousands colleague carrying out the vaccinations. 
BskyB loses complaint in the case ITV 
BskyB has its complaint against the decision of the competition commission to reduce its share in that the competing transmitter ITV, lost. 
The competition court of appeal decreed BskyB to diminish its participation in ITV of 17,9% on less than 7,5%. 
Before the commission had maintained, the share BskyBs would distort the competition and would enable it an unfair influence on the transmitter ITV. 
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 in that it renamed NTL, now in Virgin media, successfully at the purchase of ITV prevented has. 
The competition authority reported in April 2007, the purchase of the share doubts ready in ITV by BskyB about the independence of the ITV, what the competition commission moved in addition, to start an investigation. 
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication velvet Ofcom expressed itself against the purchase. 
BskyB argued to reduce the pressure its share in ITV, would be an unreasonable and exaggerated measure especially because BskyB had announced to want to abandon its rights to votes. 
District attorney affair of American new investigations in the US 
The American general district attorney delegated a special investigator to concern himself with the notice of the nine district attorneys in the USA in 2006. 
The occasion was a report of the Generalinspektors of the justice ministry in which the actions of the administration colleague were criticized. 
The report practiced criticism of the officials of the white house, legislators and the former general district attorney Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was driven of the fears, that become would be dropped lawyers for political reasons. 
The special investigator Nora Dannehy should clarify now whether the officials interrogated during the investigation designed the investigators in order to hinder the justice. 
Serious accusations including criminal action were not examined or clarified completely, said the general inspector Glenn Fine in its report. 
The calling of a special investigator with the authority on to force the witnesses to the statements, was one its head recommendations. 
The conflict began relieved as the justice ministry in December 2006 nine of US district attorneys of its offices. 
At this time argued the ministry that released would become district attorneys based on weak performance. 
However it later was assessed that the released district attorneys were not judges become worse than many of its Kollegenbe, what many observers caused in addition to regard the notices as political motivated. 
Some of these district attorneys were included into the judicial pursuit of high-ranking republican congress members while other had refused to examine the accusations over choice fraud of the democrats. 
District attorneys American US are delegated therewith to examine and to pursue judicial cases for the government. 
They can release always, may be dropped however not for political reasons. 
The at that time leader of the justice ministry general district attorney Alberto Gonzales ran because of the releases under gunfire and has lays in the end effect its offices down. 
A row of official of the justice ministry gave notice also. 
The report of the Generalinspektors critically addressed especially the roll of Gonzales in that it carried the "main responsibility" for the releases, its leadership role "abandoned" and "extraordinarily uninterested" appeared had in the process 
Other officials, under that also the former head adviser of the President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the deficient cooperation with the investigators.

The rock star Meat Loaf should "asked honored become during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for its epic hymn Out of brightly". 
The singer, who will suppose in London next week its special golden price during the award, said, he would be honored to be acknowledged. 
The song, that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title pieces to Meat Loafs hit album out of the year 1977. 
"Coldplay" cites the nominations for the price award of this year after it came in four categories into the narrower selection. 
The Chefredaktor of the periodical "Q magazines" Paul rice there said would be go out and "asked would be, some songs, that over such matters such as times and genre Out of brightly" certainly one of them. 
The song that by Jim Steinman composed became, required a strong voice that was delivered by Meat Loaf. 
It begins with an instrumental part, that lasts almost two minutes. 
The song appeared in Great Britain as a Single in 1979 in the sale and reached place 15 in the Charts. 
However Meat Loafs has "asked spent Out of brightly" about nine years in the Charts and sells itself worldwide more than 40 million once. 
Meat Loaf, whose true name Marvin lee Aday is, suffered in the last years from serious health problems. One under that an operation in 2003 was because of irregular heartbeat after it was collapsed on the stage. 
In 2007, it had to decline concerts based on an acute larynx inflammation. 
Later became well known that it had a cyst at its voice volume. 
Often forget obscure street in city, and to sell possibly soon 
New York city has thousands of rush-hour streets, avenues, side-street and other bypasses whereby some are only comfortable famous and other. 
Nevertheless it is to be said even for learned taxi drivers and long-time local heavily where extra Place is, simply because that heard never therefrom. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and passes of the First streets direction north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching the Second street. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks sooner after a dusty lane than after an actively used passage street. 
There are also no street signs. 
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard street plan. 
This street has nevertheless its admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a building business that erected recently luxurious buildings on the First streets. 
It newly wants to pave extra Place to create around a clean passage to the stores and boutiques, that are expected in the new buildings. 
To the other admirers, the long-time neighborhood that says belongs, it would be fascinated of the short lane, simple because it is one of the remnants of the past the house block. 
Yet the city administration department, that is responsible for protection and erection of the apartment houses and is responsible for the street, to receive has no interest on that, it. 
During a session of the committee for country utilization of the local council in this month, representative of the city administration and Avalon Bay sketched a suggestion for the purchase of the street through the building business. 
Nevertheless the committee preferred that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has after a new plan asked, that is supposed to be produced in the coming month, so Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the local council 3. 
"Only very little room is in the possession of the city remained and we would want, that extra Place further the city belongs", said it. 
"There could be offer how one repairs and operates the street, what could be settled by Avalon, but we wants to guarantee also, that the public access bleibt." 
Avalon Bay announced some months ago, that newly pave small street and arrange seats, that are thought among other things for a cafÃ©, at which the business room would like to rent. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street, publicly was made for the first time during the session in this month. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said wanted however not unconditionally possess that the business wanted to use the street to be sure, it it. 
"The head concern of the Avalon Bay is it this decayed lane to renovate and to a public meeting place to make", it said and joined thereto that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department for building protection meant, had been it actually the wish of the city, that to sell street and emphasized is to be developed than to administer, the task of the department it sooner the real estate. 
The Bowery compared to its colorful neighborhood, retained extra Place something of its historic impression. 
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided, between its numerous children and a narrow strip country was claimed by none. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals that was closed in 2006 opened is "stretched itself to the extra Place and the street certainly most well known as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album to Russia" of Ramones. 
The pavement was magnificent, said Danny Fields, that manager of the Ramones, who had made the photo in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap, rag and parts of casks, postal services, leaves and rope. 
Some inhabitants, including the blogger, who write over the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, rejected the idea of the sale of extra Place, with which argument that this public plot of land is, as modest as it, further should remain public. 
Others praised extra Place as a rarity â a practically unchanged gravel of the city that should be let in quiet. 
Jeremiah Moss, that New York" disappearing the blog by the name of "Jeremiahs operates lower titles (with "the book of the complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the Becoming extinct city"), published a part of the conversation of the city story over extra Place, that had appeared in the periodical "The New York" in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains even during the day dark and is" marked through rusted metal door of the warehouse halls, locked windows and on rain groove past flying week old newspapers. 
With few exceptions, the street has exactly so recently at one evening looked. 
A rat ran through the rear part of the street, far of the door, that did not lead earlier to the CBGB, where today a more expensive clothing business is. 
Graffiti were to be seen on the walls and lay an empty beer bottle on the ground not far of a fresh bundle of junked newspapers. 
Some passersby said, they would have thought about struck rarely over extra Place, but before that the street could polish up become something. 
Fields, added that after its opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in its current condition. 
The best years of my life, said it, were in the places, that were dark, damp and disgusting. 
Debate around bilingual education: Development in English language environment 
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T discuss. Izumi the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific colleague in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the field development science at the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, is thinks a co-author of the beech "not so well how one: Why the middle class of a school selection needs". 
To address the hispanischen voters a complicated task is. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions to the subject of development are a typical example for that. 
Obamas choice campaign mentioned is, to lock that "the probability in afro American and hispanischen students the school successfully, more low, than with white students" - what agrees. 
In order to close this achievement distance, Obamas development plan recommends specially transition phase one bilingual under other in training for that, that first learn English. 
Nevertheless the question exists be at Obama therein, whether use for the bilingual education, that puts the focal point on instruction in other languages as English, to reduce its interest contradicts, the distance in the school achievements. 
Let's take "Sixth street Prep", an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles as an example. 
Hispanisch are the majority of the student and come out of families with low income. 
More than a third of the student, of which many are only recently in the country, learn English. 
Nevertheless students of the fourth class insisted into 2008 astonishing 100 percent the country test in Mathe on a good level. 
Also surprisingly 93 percent of the children became out of the fourth school year in the English test as good valued. 
This astonishing success was reached with other methods when that that are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth street puts its focal point on examination and practice, on steady inspection of the knowledge and a bearing, that tolerates no exceptions. 
The expanse practice the school the extension after which the education in an English language environment passes. Exact that is the point that Obama should note, so the school leader Linda Mikels. 
This extension places importance on that almost Exclusively use of the English language in the specialty instruction. 
Woman Mikels, that rejects the idea of bilingual education, said would have take place by means of to me, that a remarkable a student, who had come first shortly before that from Mexico, to school. One later would can entered 12 months the classroom and recognize it no longer. 
"It functions", noticed in it, "it functions for us". 
Would Obama take a school such as the "Sixth street Prep" as a model for other schools with large share in Latin American and other students learning English? 
The achievements of the school easily would make the answer on this question, but the development political positions within its own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support already long the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of the bilingual education make predictions over Obamas answer uncertain. 
While it agrees with the point, that immigrants should learn English, it has recently the subject of trivialisiert in that it noticed in, that persons should stop, worries over that on legislation aiming "only English" make itself. 
Instead, it said: "You should guarantee that your child can" Spanish. 
If Obama actually wants to close the achievement distance, it should consider carefully development models, that function instead of despising it and to trivialisieren. 
The oil price sinks as a result of renewed anxieties around the economy 
The petroleum price is not could on Monday based on the fears, that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets of rich to animate the economy again, strongly please. 
The crude oil appointment businesses at that trade stock exchange New York fell in the morning session around 7 percent on $99.80 per Barrel. 
For last Monday the price has been around more than $20 sunk. 
In the last two weeks, the goods markets are both by the finance turbulences at the Wall Street and and by strong whirlwinds in the gulf by Mexico shaken become. 
After the prices had reached in July its highpoint of $145.29 per Barrel, they fell in this month on almost $90 per Barrel, around then again when consequence of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets to climb. 
On Monday investors appeared already again concerned although congress representatives had announced, it would have from the weekend on a rescue plan agreed, that should be the largest in the story. 
This message was overshadowed of new worries that the finance crisis would not be yet by far locked. 
In the chapter last first of all of the growing crisis, should, according to a government communication on Monday, that buy up Citigroup the bank businesses of the Wachovia corporation. 
Meanwhile Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have the European financial group Fortis partially nationalisiert. 
After analysts in Barclays Capital, it is in spite of the tense negotiations, that took place at the weekend and led to a rescue plan, apparently do not arrive to animate the mood on the markets. 
Because the economic situation further deteriorates itself, is to be expected that the demand becomes, among other things after oil, further sink after goods. 
Analysts of the German bank wrote in a communication to investors, had become the prognoses for the global capital markets, interests rates and exchange rates extremely uncertain. 
We believe, write it further that the goods markets will be concerned also. 
"Out of the perspective of the goods markets are we most about obtains, whether the US American viruses worldwide spreads, especially to China." 
The analysts of the bank corrected its expectations for the oil consumption based on the weak economic growth for the coming year after below, and its prognoses for the oil price and gas price for the year 2009 around 20% sunk. 
Team record through series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he would have seen everything, after he ran up in the last eight and a half years more often than every other in the jet tricot. 
Then it saw on Sunday the second quarter in which the jets changed a futile game into a triumph train. 
"So something have I never seen", said Ellis. 
After a sloppy game between the jet and the Arizonas Cardinals, that corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began. 
When however quart cheek board Favres passport arrived in Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-Touchdown 12-Yard-Touchdown YARD 12-Yard-Touchdown 12-Yard-Touchdown, marked that the perfect prelude to an afternoon at that its self-developing collaboration a giant step forwards made. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for yet two Touchdowns, that slipped one once as an outside defender, and the seconds other once 10 before end of the half-time. 
"I have me not especially exerted", says went Coles over the passports that to Coles. 
"It is a super player. 
Our voting agreed, think equal what the people." 
While Favre and Coles catching played, the defense quart cheek Kurt Warner took apart. 
Outside defender Darrelle Revis intercepted perished one throw and changed it into a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik smith came at another passport and caught it off. 
Linebacker David Bowens provided then for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball loss, forced in Bowens, was probable the most crazy. 
The Cardinal still had the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game conquered as the jets the ball of recaptured and Jay Feely a 20 yard shot to that 34 to 0 leaderships changed. 
Those were obtained had most points that the jets ever in one-quarter. 
Asked as it became answered to describe the insanity Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "the second quarter or the third quarter?" 
On the answer both, for the jets points let in the third quarter 21 to without an only to obtain, said Mangini: "Believe wetted me, I the second quarter more than the third. 
A quantity of point became in short time erzielt." 
Rested Gebrselassie strikes its world record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia showed again why it many a consider to be the best long-range runner of all times, after he broke in the Berliner marathon on Sunday its own record and to the first person become is, who created the stretch of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its prior results of 2:04:26 around 27 seconds, that it had reached last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has sets up therewith its 26th world record in its multilateral career, in which it reached at least a world championship title on every stretch from a kilometer to the marathon or set up a world record. 
Gebrselassie left out last month the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of anxiety, that was exaggerated afterwards perhaps, that the air soiling could aggravate its asthma problems. 
Instead he registered for the contest in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - in sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on target -, Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds won per mile. 
Since train runner such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya on long-range, the record time is fell for marathon in the last 10 years around more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo won there Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05. 
After its victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press announced, would have had it two weeks ago cramps in its calf and was not able to train therefore a week. 
Obviously it is refreshed after recess and returned not on rusted. 
"I am so happy", said it to reporter. 
"Everything perfectly ran. 
I received the training a week ago again and had today a few more objection, but at the end what all super." 
It became for that criticizes - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rival out of east Africa - that it excessively orchestrates its race courses, many world best marathon stars generally avoids, itself too very on the race leaders leaves as if that would be a train race, and places world records over the contest. 
Yet this criticism damages the size Gebrselassies as a long-range runner hardly. 
Accompanied of four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie had reached the midpoint of the stretch in 1:02:04. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie have demands further after the speed makers had diminished. 
Gebrselassie made something more than three miles before the Finish its last start in order to separate itself from Kwambai, that arrived as second in 2:05:36 and improved therewith its best time around almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48. 
With women has Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, a notable year locked, in that she showed the seventh fastest result of all times with 2:19:19. 
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
In the last spring, marathon in 2:24:14 had won the 36 years Mikitenko old surprisingly the Londoner. 
It missed the games in Beijing, because of problems, that became as a back injury of described. However she recovered in order to win in Berlin and to improve its best time in its third marathon around five minutes. 
It planned its course adept in that it let first pull out a quartet out of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtook after 30 kilometers. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop arrived from Kenya as third in 2:25:01. 
The pride and the strain in life of the black population, in a city of the entirely special type 
Hides between the outgrowths of the leisure time parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles of the glittering, loud and gigantic driving removes, lies a quiet city in which the pride and the complication of the Afro American culture to the light come. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is to be described did no longer so simply like Hurston it in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three KrocketplÃ¤tzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim site. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby de are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come to remember around the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. 
And nevertheless the city, that is and remains describes it â and that it to a tourist excursion goal made, in that it it in the Floridas guide included, that at present the depression of the federal author project produces became â in many regard a place of the entirely special sort. 
Eatonville is not so independent, solid and privately like in the 1930ern when Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to divide its true thoughts with the white man, that knows "so few over us, that he knows what it entgeht." 
Even nowadays, in a year in that a black PrÃ¤sidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to an open discussion about race ratios calls, are tired of it many here further to be observed of outsiders. 
"We very on that are considered like our story told becomes", so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth an inhabitant of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city. 
It must agree." 
Eatonville became long time as paradoxical the triumph and the battle defined. 
It is both is twice as high a historic example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in that the poverty quota like the national average. 
It is on the one hand a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of that - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprisingly that inhabitants are here both proud and on the hat. 
And so correctly the objections began it around Eatonville's image actually with Zora how here all Hurston name. 
It placed the world its home town in books before, that came of hearts and were written in dialect, so like "paint and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide of changed the city, that lies entirely near the route 77, a street that through the often forgotten center Floridas leads, to the scenes of black story and human drama. 
Impudent like Oskar both in the actual life and in the literature, Hurston reader led mayor, Joe Clarke, first to the store by Eatonvilles and turned then more private matters to. 
"To one side of the street to the left", wrote it, "is that brown -knows painted modern school, with its cultivated gardens and playgrounds, around which itself always Howard Miller worries, although it do hardly read and write kann." 
It mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that lee Glenn "drinks of each type sells and what-also-always to hour rooms passt." 
In only few hundred words Hurston connected therefore Eatonville with even government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was very certainly no guide. 
In the deed, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all. 
"Zora described the things so, how it were", so the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the maggots the Hurston immortalized in that it the men quoted, who sang songs over that its beauty, that were full sexual allusion. 
It added: "Many people disliked this." 
One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin, that regularly returned, after its family was pulled to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston came into the city gebraust, it this usually without warning did, clothes in a making noise Chevrolet, smoking and with pairs of pants, imagines that in a city even today something on its venerable clothing style. 
According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated whereas many of they despised. 
"The people were always happily Zora to see", said Mr Franklin. 
But "it remained too long", it never joined swung thereto during it in its chair, on a terrace lain to the rear, that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was baptized according to all probability. 
As Hurston in 1960 died was it poor and its books assaulted. 
Together with the large part of the world, Eatonville seemed forgotten it to have. 
Although she was once a famous author, a time comrade Langstin Hughes and the single black woman at the bar Ard College in the 1920ern, was buried it in fort Pierce, Florida where she lived, in an anonymous grave. 
In Eatonville, there was no large commemorative celebration, no public reading on a large scale. 
"I think, that it its contribution in the world or its heir in the slightest understood have", so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography over Hurston the 2003 published became not. 
The turning point came in the '80's. 
County authorities orange wanted to put a fÃ¼nfspurige freeway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow zweispurige main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had pressed already the freeway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The suggestion became submits when Eatonville recovered yet always of a difficult phase in its story. 
Compulsion integration, among other things, had set the relatively idyllic isolation of the community an end. 
In the '50's the battle against race mixture hate brought into the partnership. 
"In this time came often a pile of white boys and it threw orange and thing on that to one side of sitting people", said Mr. Franklin. 
"There was killed became even once a woman that at the same time. 
They threw a water melon out of the car." 
In 1955, Hurston examined in one write to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the waiter court to force integration in that it designated its decision in the case Brown against the schools inspector as "insulting instead of my race respecting". 
Inhabitants say nowadays that although the lifting of the race separation in many a regard was positive, it that the group consistency in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth weakened. 
"Black children were it accustoms, embraced to become - I remind one me on that - one embraced its teacher of the morning and one embraced its teacher in the evening", so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the public-spirited group to the protection of the Eatonville partnership. 
That uprightly could be received so long, joined it thereto until teacher and student came no longer out of the same place. 
"One embraced its white teacher not, for he was a white teacher - I my there is a cultural crevice available", said woman Nathiri. 
However the civil rights contributed in addition that place was created for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actor and artist who disregarded prejudices, so how it did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How someone can deny herself the joy of my company! 
I do not understand it." 
In 1975, the author got going grave of nameless Alice Walker to Hurstons and began to fight for the revitalization of its renown. 
A much praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway in the bookshelves later was to be found five years, and it made again to a part of the American literature canon. 
The distance street project came exactly at one time, in which Eatonvilles stood most famous daughter again once in the light of the public. 
Hurstons saw and this time old neighbors it as a rescuer. 
The community began to show festivals in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston over what the district with the building of the freeway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the ErÃ¶ffnungsevent two years later, and many turn every January for the celebration back. 
A few years later the district of its street blueprints turned away itself. 
"The plans of a fÃ¼nfspurigen distance street of animated the city, accelerated the entire with top speed, woke real citizen pride", said woman Nathiri. 
Woman Boyd expressed it somewhat more simply: "Zora rescued Eatonville." 
The victory against the distance street project contributed to a variation of the even picture of the city. 
Came began more and more train trip, so like avenge yard Munson, a lawyer, that has gone since 1993 here into the church, and domestic to appreciate the past newly. 
Eatonville was included 1998 in the nationwide historic index. 
A new single-story library (naturally after Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the new paved and brightened up Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville is as always a peculiarity in Florida: she can feel established became herself only 6 miles of the city center Orlandos sometimes like a rear lane in the summer rain, so small like at that time as it by only 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(You is nowadays to 90% black). 
Outside in search of the story Eatonvilles and its meaning are treated often still with caution. 
For most interviews, a permission in the forefield is not may be photographed necessary and certain things - so like the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles of oldest church, that of a white painted became and black men in the field work represents -. 
Many in Eatonville, like woman Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a predeliction for dark red, fear still that its shielded partnership is misunderstood. 
And nevertheless, to the same time to that the Hurston festival larger became, was born also an increased degree at homeland pride. 
Above all young persons tend saw in addition to see Eatonville so like Hurston its total race: beautifully, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proudly, creatively and diligently, foolishly and mixes through like each other race group and people group in America. 
It is hear can the honest love to this city that one in the voice of Mr. Franklins nephew, utilize could the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, that to return has before after the College after Eatonville, in order to work in the city administration or at the police, that loud it something aid. 
And even the boys, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins out of winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people who pass through only here, will think: "Alas, this city is nothing in comparison with all the other", said Alondra Kenon recently at a Sunday after the church. 
"But if one actually stops and a moment long its story observes, is it a very beautiful city." 
Here here in New York, one speaks fluently finance latin. 
On the first view, did nothing change. 
If tourists kept away himself in Manhattan of the newsstands and the powerful TV screen in the Times Square, they would notice not at all that they are middle in a debacle. 
You never would believe that over its beheading, in which shoe -like office with the glass facades, banker and Hedgefondverwalter, that the monopoly in New York have, daily the worst horror workday since the stock exchange slump of 1929 have. 
The suppliers push still with loud rattles the metallenen tea vehicles along sidewalk and convey load are tray that with Muffins for the breakfast sessions. 
Latinos shuffle still between Apartments around how human pack animals load with about 50 ironed T Shirts, that hang on a pole lying yoke similar on its shoulders. 
Office employees wait is still at itself for the sidewalk finding meal state on its FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cksbagel and it still impossibly at a weekday between 16 and to got 19 o'clock a yellow taxi. 
It did not feel at all at like a crisis until I concluded Thursday afternoon based on all the end of the world talk to open a new savings account. 
Although I concluded had my duty gear temporally on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribe branch to put, stood already approximately 20 people snake. 
Order not to remove or to deposit at the money switches around money, but rather at the customer service switch where patrons checkbook, ask tourist about the way to the department store Macy's it and open where new customers accounts. 
That before me, I learned later "personal bank clerk with license" of Starr, my, stood for the same reason such as I snake. 
In contrast to me however, they had removed already its saved of smaller banks, commuted at places of where out of it, so like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
They had removed money of so named Thrifts (a few of a building society resembling), union banks and those local savings banks, that have branch only in a country, and say that it its customers such as family treat. 
In the last year, 15 of these banks are quiet and quietly bankruptcy gone. 
In the last couples of days, Washington Mutual, a bank with plants in height passed over of $327 billions, in receivership and as a letzen Friday New York home over the weekend went, was Wachovia, a further bank, that possesses save plants in the value of $440 billions, in search of a rescuing buyer. 
In the fear before a further collapse, the office employees and store employees brought stood looked at becomes that before me its Bares a bank that than a certain harbor, is responsible a bank that for most RettungsaufkÃ¤ufe at the Wall Street. 
Entirely normal New York appropriated itself in the last week fluent finance latin. 
A woman, who telephoned in my Chinese tribe supermarket, made with bank gone so much familiarity reference to Lehman Brothers, the bankruptcy and its emaciateed looking chairman of the board thickly Fuld, as would become it over one go bad colleagues lÃ¤stern. 
And Lyn that come off is about 50-year-old uniformed Concierge of my block of flats by our usual support subjects over Brad and Angelina and my groceries delivery. 
"I have me now all my savings in money market fund" told it after my visit in the bank. 
"I changed, I go NO more Risko a." 
Muslemische graves disgraced during right landslide in Austria 
Heinz Christian Strache, a links arranged of the Austrian right free party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams concern, take on Thursday, the 17th of January 2008, at a demonstration in Antwerp part in order to represent the organization of "cities against Islamisierung". 
They carry portrayed is signs in the style of traffic sign on the mosque one, painted through with a red line. 
The police accuses indicate right-wing extremists of the grave desecration on a Muslim cemetery in Austria, at the same weekend at the extremely right party considerable profits in the parliament choice of the country. 
In the night of Friday on this morning, more became than 90 graves on the cemetery in Traun in Linz in one, according to police, organized action heavily damaged. 
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David star on some of the graves, however criminalist consider this to be an attempt to disguise the subject of the extremists driven by the hate on Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether the occurrence in any manner in connection with the choices stands. 
A speaker of the local Islamic partnership said would be shaken" took place tends it "deeply over the message of the grave desecration, that as itself the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans to the end. 
To the same time, a round conscience research stands in Austria after the country in the parliament of yesterday choice slipped to the right. 
The FPÃ and the alliance for the future of Austria, that got both far to the right of arranged parties that almost 30% the voices, intervened in its campaign for a law strict Anti immigrant and some of its choice sayings became by opponent as xenophobic criticized.

`Ich receives the master behind the stage to hold around its character', GÃ¼nter brewer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no frill, no costumes for the entrance. 
Nature of the large FlamencotÃ¤nzer, that forgo the concentration and dedicate itself the interpretation, in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand artist 
On the other hand personality 
I look in in private life, into these moments, that are strange for the public, I know when I will not enter for the personality typical gesture, that depth of a stolen view or expression strength of the hands, that are provided, because it the stage, find can. 
In its project `Flamenco people' the German photographer GÃ¼nter farmer abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some productions represents on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist. Of this side, it was for the artists yet little well known. 
With this suggestion, the photographer a special Ikonografie of the Flamencodarstellung creates on different plains. 
The display, that belongs to the program of the month of photography the Flamenco, `spiegelt the international importance of Flamenco, that becomes more and more of the day to day larger, against', the artist explains and makes clearly that `Flamenco people can be' `jeder any person, but if one looks at the photos, the spectator notices that it are no typical pictures of artist on the stage. 
Entirely normal persons on the portraits are are to be mediated artist, who in a position on the stage passion, sadness, joy and to move therewith the public. 
In order to be able to hold the personality of this artist, must make one no photos on the stage. 
Your personality and its character is in its hearts. 
To create what interested was me, a personal atmosphere, that would enable me to hold with the photo camera the characters of the largest Flamencomeister'. 
Farmer, inspired of the festival `Cante de Minas read', made itself in 1997 on a long trip in order to photograph singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the available material, pictures that remind one of classic photography emerged. 
The use of different stylistic means destroys the classic base of the picture by what means the picture the modernity and the idea, how the farmer Flamenco understands, lent become: `Musik with traditional roots that changes and every day surprises'. 
Those are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental game at itself, but rather the personality of the artist, be character, that with its art the public tempts. 
That search for the essential, after a certain something, which becomes in form of the hearing, the his visible, is and was the firm goal of this work, that is presented in the near future in the gallery of the els FotÃ³mata. 
Well known personalities in Flamenco under them Diego el Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, el Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of the almost seventy artist, that were photographed. 
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will become soon as a book, with all portraits out of the display, appear. 
Bauers passion to the portraits led it in addition to take up this idea two years ago yet once and to realize as a `PortrÃ¤ts of the veteran of the sport' (`SportARTproject'). 
Although the drafts of the project `Flamenco people are different', the photographer to `es gives pleases me very to photograph the people, to learn know it and to transfer me into its life condition, would be it for a short moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of photography the portrait is the most difficult species. 
You meet or bump into persons, personalities, whom you do not know sometimes at all, or they let you for a couple of minutes alone in order to be able to make a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, when photographer I try to realize always my ideas.' 
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos of today with the title `Flamenco people' FotÃ³mata is issued in the gallery of the el, that is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and passes parallel to the street la Alameda de HÃ©rcules. You can see the display to the 16th of October.

`Sangre de mayo' : Hero book of Garci 
Inspires of `Episodios Nacionales' of Benito PÃ©rez GaldÃ³s, places JosÃ© Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the Frenchmen there. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million Euro investment for the filming. 
In this manner the Cineast tried to represent `eine quantity of personalities and social analysis', what it had admired always at the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim GutiÃ©rrez and Paula EchevarrÃ­a at the beginning of a long index of the performer. 
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, is presented this Friday in movie theaters and shown later on the transmitter Telemadrid than a four hour mini series. 
JosÃ© Luis Garci, large fan of the literature of GaldÃ³s, assures that thanks to this filming its `Kindheitstraum went' in fulfillment. It has this Esperanza Aguirre to owe, that delegated it three years ago of the autonomous partnership Madrid, to turn a commemorative film to the second century celebration on the 2nd of November in Madrid. Above all, because the story is based on the base of `Episodios Nacionales', that supposed the order. 
The total contribution of 15 million, that by the autonomous partnership Madrid was placed for filming, offers brought become was to be represented Garci how it added, the `einmalige possibility' with the help of decoration and corresponding garments the picture of the `verwirrten Spain, which chose the incorrect leader for the battle, because the people by the battle for the independence and under the domination the Ferdinands of the VII in residue'. 
However the Cineast regrets that one was not able to reckon with the financing such as in `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice so highly as in `Sangre de mayo'), therefore some scenes could not be turned out of the script with Horacio ValcÃ¡rcel, with which Garci collaborated almost its entire career. 
For this reason, has Garci, that also film director in `Volver a empezar was', through its usual mode of operation co-operated: he stood first rehearse must on the stage to the actors, with which one before one to turn begins and for that, that had made no Casting, appear he `demÃ¼tigend' and respect providing to perform `ein part of the occupation of the film director exists therein, aid in the theater and in the movie theater What in the movie theater industry, in which one works, geschieht.' 
Many performers, on whom he knocks mayo in `Sangre de', must repeat before its camera, like in the case of Miguel RellÃ¡n, Carlos LarraÃ±aga or Fernando GuillÃ©n Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he one won has), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates, that represent this year Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, represents, a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither `Sangre de mayo', yet `Siete mesas de billar francÃ©s' and in the end also not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film, Garci expects no honors. 
You believe `Am beginning that you work for the descendants, later notice you that it is only for the development, and now you are has satisfied, if one another film produced', explain Garci after more than 30 years occupation activity.

Your dancing was sensual and was said to me, lies that my dancing also in this aesthetic area', maintains it. 
The production reckons with two extraordinary collaboration: with Miguel Poveda, that will sing yet once for Isabel with one of its presentations, like it it also in `La puerta abierta' done has; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally together with one of its former students.

`Ich wanted to call back it in memory, for I think, it is knows one of the women to appreciate, who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch, and its work today no more and it therefore yet fewer', maintains BayÃ³n. 
The presentation takes place today Vega around 20:30 in the theater Lope de. 
The publication of the beech `Diario de un poeta reciÃ©n casado' also the Triennium includes 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta reciÃ©n casado' in the Saint Stephen's it Church (New York), at a place where Juan RamÃ³n JimÃ©nez married 1916 Zenobia to carry out offers a corresponding atmosphere, around planned activities on behalf the Andalusian advice for culture, in order to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan RamÃ³n' (2006-2008).

The USA badly can imagine without Paul Newman 
`Manchmal creates God perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of them.' 
This sentence comes came of the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with it in `Sensationsreporterin', and of the at that time ruling presentation of the US American movie theater, which became in the sting of calm, of entirely America until Newman with its enthusing presentation and followed it. 
Show now once, what it it cost to lend it the Oscar. 
And as it 2007 withdrew. 
And it knew that it was very sick. 
Nevertheless that was a large blow for everyone. 
`Was one sometimes feels, is lost were essential more than an expression, and now I a large friend', said Robert Redford crying, `mein life and my country the largest Drolligkeiten of its Lebens.' 
None had itself anxiety neither laughably to make to exaggerate yet. 
As a `Vater' the movie theater and the homeland it died in a sad moment, would become, in which fear rules of terrorist and before the market breakdown, in which the struck down even value feeling of the US American search on the hopeless for reasons, around to get back, is. 
If in this hard time without virtue only a few persons that one can admire remain, one doesn't have to be unconditional Luis Cernuda in order to love Paul Newman. 
For everyone, it embodied more or less a platonic ideally the beauty and the truth. 
It was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like different losses both also profits: by the foundation, that prescribed itself the battle against the drug, and in honor of its son out of the first marriage, that died at overdose, established became up to the own sign of home-made and organic products. 
That everything is a gift for the country, in which it cost it much effort, to prevail against a deadly nourishment culture. 
A wide wave of the surprise strikes to take house high over Hollywood without consideration on nationality and citizenship. 
The last James bound, who confirmed Englishman Daniel Craig,, that not only a person died, but rather the entire era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and OscarpreistrÃ¤ger, said that the work with Newman was no longer or not less than the tip of its career. 
Russell Crowe that badly boy ventured, who came from Australia to designate Newman as its largest inspiration. 
The largest of us left `Uns all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of few, that lived trust to live try itself today like Paul Newman: received high demands on the uprightness, removes lead a responsible private life, far of the cameras. 
That is not always simple or not once possible in the current Mediendschungel. 
But there are was someone whom it tries, and Paul Newman an example for that. 
He let separate himself a time and was married after that fifty years with Joanne Woodward, gave that he was faithful, although it certainly many possibilities it to be not. 
Should `Wozu I eat a Hamburger on the street if I have home fillet?', joked he often himself. 
In the sky, it will be proudly on that that on the earth its daughters have the same opinion such as its fans, what is not unconditionally usual in America. 
`Von all large rolls that it played, on none it was as proud as on that of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and that of the philanthrophist', say it. 
For the Olympic games, the streets in Madrid are deficient. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is, to arrange some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, can be it yet perhaps 2016. 
But I ask me: `Sind we for that before ready?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it does not agree! 
It was designated as a perfect street, and my judgment after, was was it the worst street with all drum and at it, that there. 
Naturally the one quantity of nonsense is if one would note the estimation and I could test it, would be so what unambiguously not come through. 
But, let's go through from the beginning all. 
The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen, that permits you to go firster. 
It seems to be also not badly to me, but if they let already advance you, they should give you also everything (inclusive chips, around the obstructions on the street to avoid). 
Therefore yet not. 
Here they let get you only the ticket (the first nonsense, that therein exists, only therefore there to go) and (after an endless queue) there the surprise is! There was the T Shirt only in the size `S' (a second nonsense, because I the size XL would need) 
Where shall we live then actually? 
Is it or decided became so, that after the crisis only small to buy much cheap shirt out of less material? 
Therefore well, things how this are a trifle in comparison with the days on the street. 
Seen therefrom that one very early must go in order to get the chip, is there already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, must lie let one the knapsack. 
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, is incomprehensible what in the case of a street where 11,000 persons expected become. 
In the end, how it was to be expected also, the street did not begin and we had our back sacks before that lie let, also to get if it was arrive once, but it back would be already more hard. 
Moreover it looked, in these 40 minutes wait after rain so that it came to the temptation to organize a people uprising and to attack the cottage. 
I believe, mornings will have certainly some 500 persons pneumonia and will appear some how I because of this chip, that I got, not once on time at the classification, I already can think myself that the exit incorrectly was stamped. 
Obviously, if one would ask me about a perfect street, this street never would occur to me. 
So I believe will dream, we yet long of a city, that is prepared for the Olympic games well 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the `Emerging Technology Conference', would arrange of WITH, introduced Microsoft the progress of the new picture recognition system and the person interaction, order a being of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence which is capable however to settle some primitive tasks, like for example a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft is that a route plan, around itself on the campus of the business to move). The system notes that what hears it during the support. 
Thanks to a camera and a form system and face recognition system, this `Rezeptionistin can recognize' how many persons are in the room, who they are and remember even, how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of its support. 
It can incorporate also the presents after the conversations into the groups. 
In the presentation video, `die Rezeptionistin notes' a third person, but she understands that this person to the group who leads with its conversation is not, accompanying, and that also no firm employee is. 
It inquires whether the person wants and answers visit here someone, that she will listen soon. 
All without the blue Screenshot 
Impressively 
That is certainly the future. 
Now the business has things better on which it can concentrate, for example on the next version of its operating system windows. 
One spoke this week very superficially over the change of strategy about Microsoft. 
Windows 7 more quickly will be and will have not so many bound programs. 
Steve Ballmer assessed that if the computers would be equipped with the most necessary instead of filling it with the commercial rubbish, five times more quickly would function it. Person, Steven, that will be only for the few. 
Everything is only a determination if one considers, that Microsoft in windows added versions one or function and `Extras' to other. 
The direction change is worthwhile 
The Microsoft lost right, the operating system gradually at meaning, exactly like the software. 
When Googles appear to chrome in the network, that was a part of the theory that it would be the first step of Google in order to compete with windows. 
Sent showed many on that there that the browser is no operating system. 
The operating system when a part indispensable, will be always necessary so that hardware and software simultaneously can function. 
The operating system fulfills the function, that can be compared to the function of its wife or its husband, if it goes therefore to announce its mother-in-law something. 
That agrees. 
The system never will disappear, but one must not at its `Tod', as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, think. 
What said this week to Ballmer, is the confirmation of this idea. 
The persons give each time less attention the operating system, for that more the Web browser. 
The computer only is started in order to carry out the Firefox, the explorer or chrome and every day spend we more time at the surfing, than in the environment of the `Fenster'. 
For what does the half in the computer of available uses serve? 
Fewer is more 
And windows 7 must be compacter, much compact than a Vista. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, complicates fewer. 
The interest of Microsoft it exists more therein to integrate its Online services, that can become then in the end the alternative Google. 
In the reality, they need that, without doubt. I bring a small example for that. 
I have the photo of this place in speech moon, made employee in one of the recovery room for Microsoft at the beginning of the month. 
On the refreshment drink vending machine, a sign is secured: `Deine search. Our future'. It prints out a favor to use own tool for Online search. 
In 2006, an independent study to the end came that that 66% the employee used with Microsoft, Google for the investigation in the network. 
By the way, last week was confirmed also that the new version of the windows ran mobile 7 in the delay. 
It will not appear originally, but rather end 2009, sooner even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks the possibility to bring windows 7 and windows mobile 7 simultaneously on the marks. 
Every day the telephone in a computer changes itself. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.

The drivers, who can become because of the alcohol mirror recidivous, will have to install the `Alcolock'. 
The authority arranges that the driver, who had three official punishments because of the alcohol mirror, installs this system in its car, which forbids it to start the car in the drunk condition. If it is inebriated, the vehicle starts not. 
The initiative was announced already in the last month in June and is already now a part of the report of the general district attorney sheep. After its statements, it concerns a pilot project, which will last a year long. 
The purpose is the Resozialisierung of the driver why this gets a course for the re-education of the traffic behavior. 
Except the general district attorney's office, according to experience, will participate on that also the transportation ministry and the foundation of the technical institute for security of the automobiles. 
According to statistics, between 30-75% the driver, who were indicated more than a time because of the going under alcohol influence, again at tax sat down. 
The `alcolock' that would prevent because it is a system with the car connected, it measures the alcohol salaries in the breathed out air and prevents made has car start, if the drivers alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is assessed, that is permitted more highly than. 
It costs more than 1,000 Euro, that carried become costs by that one, that the sanction imposes. 
In this context, has a study, that was carried out in the USA in 2007, shown that with these devices equipped cars prevent already in the first year after its introduction until 65% of the rule offences. 
In Spain, one calculates therewith that it annually 115 human lives could be rescued. 
The measure is restricted to the administration sanction for two reasons: this behavior in attack to take before it become a criminal offense. 
In order around to ease its implementation, a legal reform can be realized on the usual way, and nevertheless a reform of the constitutional law is demanded, that is necessary for the punishment pursuit process. 
Yet the device is on the Spanish markets, in no business available although it was incorporated already into some utility vehicles and vehicles of the public transportation. 
Calculated tomorrow, becomes the house of representatives because of the initiative of the Spanish of socialistic worker party that proposes to install this system in school penances, vote. This already was made in France.

The sun went down, but its rays yet forced to use the hand as a parasol, to see around the royal couple, which got off of the airplane.

The sovereign appears smiling, clothes was announced in navy blue, and it, that sovereign, with long hairs blown by the wind, without usual `peep toes', perhaps to it that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF. 
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in whom the official entourage waits. 
At the door of the hotel, in which they are accommodated one of the four largest in the city, waits for it a reporter of the mexican television who makes gladly jokes.

The stress is angry that the 21st century. 
But there are not one and not two methods, around the daily exhaustion and the problems how one disengages of the work world, to fight.

The work against the stress is named to relax itself `1001 possibilities' and so the quiet which mediates the book comes, into the book shop of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
To reach who means that it impossibly is, the quiet in the areas such as job with the help of personal contacts, this handbook of such belief refutes. 
Moreover the methods are offered how one remains in the contact with nature or proposed the 100% natural prescriptions, that lead to the relaxation.

Speak in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I my not that, that wake up and tell us at the same time something, what happened at the day before that, but rather the children who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens you for the first time, in the best case will be frightened has it, but in the reality that no meaning. 
That is a positive insomnia that is named the speaking in the sleep. 
It is spread rather, above all at the children and youth. 
Certainly, became more than one of you told that its at night spoken has. 
This phenomenon occasionally can appear (a time in life, for example, like during the high fever), or regularly (every day, a time per week, a time in the month), at the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is no single reason that this appearance causes. 
Often are sought connections with other appearances in the sleep, gives like nightmares, panic-stricken anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (bed wetnesses at night), speaking in the sleep sought, but it no reason for that. 
How we already earlier mentioned it, it can lie at very high fiber, stress situations or overstrain. 
In any case, that is a little investigated phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or can be it entire an opposite (screams, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases if the remark is very intensive, is recommended to observe the child and to let advised itself at a specialist, in order to review whether a problem exists, which anxiety causes and comes in this manner into being. 
We said that it is a positive interference, therefore it is not treated, would be it, it is with another insomnia connected, that can become treated (for example, with the sleep Apnoe or with the stress). 
Carry out what one is make can, a series of simple prevention measures: 
Do not try to excite the child before the sleep. 
Choose therefore, quiet games for the child and avoid stressful television programs, that are terrible and somewhat too wild. 
At the nervous children, whom relaxations are recommended, relaxation methods can be used in order to help them, to got a certain internal quiet. 
That helps to sleep the child quietly. 
If the speaking in the sleep occurs once, to preserve tried the quiet. 
Thinks that it harmlessly is for the child and of the next day will be able to remember it nothing, what happened. 
Useful pieces of advice 
Do not rouse it. 
That is useless, for the child is unconscious, will tear it it out of the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, sleeps it, therefore rests it itself from. 
Keeps in mind if it appears after a couple of appearances frightened, is recommended to let or to find advised itself out, which reason has the child for the anxiety. 
If they understand, what says it (what so usually is), the child does not pressure not in order to carry out an interrogation and to get more information. 
So will be able to reach its therewith nothing because if the child sleeps, is do not think about can it unconscious and about that. 
Moreover, will hear it, will not know what says it, but you, would be, what dreams it and says why it that, therefore it careful with the interpretation of the information and the ends, that pulls its from that. 
Perhaps, it does not say that its that hear at night and know its secrets to the child. 
Not once as joke. 
That causes much anxiety. 
Therefore, makes is dredge you no worries, it nothing, is that a moment that lasts only a few minutes. 
IllhÃ¤usern... finally 
After a long thirst stretch, IllhÃ¤usern is on the playing field finite again on success course. 
Gate chances numerous without large exertion erspielten itself the yellow black and created it to transfer one of them, and to win so the game. 
The speed of this encounter with which the aggressors had effort to show its ability, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot went past tightly the angle, should dominate IllhÃ¤usern with lightness the game, and it succeeded alternating first Fonderflick with a distance shot to demand then brain with a high passport, and Romany with a shot with the foot tip, the defense of Denmark. 
The hostile team blocked in the field middle and let only the lively Riahi at the tip of the storm through. 
The start of the second half-time should be decisively with first of all two through Riahi and temporal fought for gate chances, and equally after that with the first gate for the IllhÃ¤user through Marais, that exactly correctly stood in order to suppose a ball again, that had been defended in a first attempt of Diebold. 
Yet the illhÃ¤usische scorer should not be enjoy can good fortune long and sent become about twelve minutes later on the bank by what means its team comrades must numerically been subject expanse play. 
Denmark however knew not to exploit this and stood retracted an illhaeusischen eleven no large problems toward, that only a few, around its defense to `verdichten' except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball went past after a large disorder very nearly the slat.

Obama, victor after points in the first TV duel 
On the first debate of both candidate for the white house of the Friday, a further followed to find around out, who followed than a victor from that, John McCain or Barack Obama. 
How expected announced the QGs to the choice both the republican and the democrats its own victory in this TV duel, that should be pursued by one-third of the American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen appreciates that John McCains achievement was not, although thoroughly sizably, `brillant' enough in order to enable it, to stop its decline in the choice surveys five weeks before the presidency choices yet. 
The Gallup institute, of which on Saturday an opinion survey was published, that according to Obama with five points ahead (49% lies to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the democrat makes unambiguously the better figure. 
At the yet irresolute voters, therefore which on which it arrives now, Obama with 39% followed seeing as a victor out of the surveys, during loudly a CBS survey 25% of them McCain as a victor. 
Obama should be expected its advantage on Thursday with the good achievement, that bathed by its rival Joseph in first and only public debates with its Rivalin Sarah Palin,, confirm can 
`Es would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It has good instincts', warned however this weekend Bill Clinton. 
The seventy year-old McCain did not stop moving its incontestable experience in the field of the foreign policy into the foreground, and to underline at the same time very clearly the `NaivitÃ¤t' its opponent regarding these questions, that formed the midpoint of this first TV duel. 
`Senator Obama does not seem emphasized to understand, that. ..', it several times. 
`Ich does not believe that senator Obama controls the necessary experience and the required knowledge to become around president', assured he moreover. 
An attack point that is preached since yesterday in the republican choice advertisement. 
Obama itself emphasized that it represents the future. 
He expressed himself shortly and precise without letting bring itself out of the frame. 
It moved its capacity into the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the picture, that has the world of the United States. 
`McCain not yet always understood, Obama on the other hand already, set this weekend a democratic choice advertisement on the other hand, in which republican was reproached to not to have grasped the complete size of the crisis, that weighs on the `Amerikaner of the street'. 
`WÃ¤hrend the 90 minutes of the debate had John McCain a quantity of thing over me to say, but nothing over you', denounced Obama yesterday before 20,000 persons on, who had met himself on the occasion of a choice organization in north Carolina in streaming rain. 
It did not mention once the words `Mittelstand' or `Arbeiter'. ' Obama that the Americans consider to be most suitable provides the finance crisis to rescue the economy even yet at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage. 
Week coming `Die could represent a decisive turning point', appreciated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer. 
The democratic representative cream Emanuel, a former member of the government Clinton, compared the `guten of economic instinct' Obamas to which of Bill Clinton during the finance crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate, the momentary crisis `das conclusion judgment of a 8-year-old bad economic policy is that by George Bushes transferred and by senator McCain supported become is'. 
After it had emphasized again, that it probably even would create it to sink the taxes for 95% of the American in spite of the variations at the Wall Street, the senator of Illinois referred on that that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the support of renewable energies would possess uppermost priority, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, for it.

Does `Haben you note that in Minsk a choice place found?' 
Youthful and opposition demonstrated Sunday on the main square of the white Russian capital evening in order to reject already in advance the results of the parliament choices. 
Several hundred white Russians met itself Sunday evening since closing of the polling stations on the market place of Minsk in order to protest against the deceitful character of the parliament choices. 
Although yet no result had been announced, numerous youths had come in order to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: `Der dictator should resign'. 
Some admit that they selected first not at all: `Was utilizes that if they make yet before with my voice, what it want', says a youth. 
They do not believe that the regime, that appeared the foreign observers in the best light, to receive around the negotiations with the European Union again, in addition is ready to perform a democratic turning point. 
The sanction, under that the more not part of visas for 40 leading white Russian personalities and the Aufeislegen of certain fortunes, could be canceled if these choices would be estimated by the observers as clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not it. 
`Wir were excluded of the choice commissions and were allowed to participate our observers not in the counting', regretted Juri Potemkin, press officer of the union of democratic powers, a heterogeneous amalgamation of twelve parties. 
This is a cosmetic variation, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the presidency choice 2006 and leader of that per-Europe-movement, for it is of importance, who counts out the voices, and here that is the executive. 
If delegates of the opposition take in into the parliament, then because they were appointed, and not selected. 
But its entrance into the parliament can broadcasting time on television, mean meeting in the regions and legal proposals. ' 
It is itself the opposition therefore indebted to interfere into the political game, for `der dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
For if our economy that is strongly debt-ridden vis-Ã -vis Russia runs into a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, let's run danger to become a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we want to be independent'. 
The opposition fears that the organization for security and collaboration in Europe, that pursued the choice circumstances, that does not acknowledge choice as valid. 
It emphasizes that the voter turnout numbers appear to highly, and that the expansion of the voting smoothed in advance (26% of the voter of Minsk) the way for each type of manipulation. 
`Haben you notes, taken place that a choice hat?, asks the leader of the socially democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of both last political prisoner that were released in August these years. 
In the polling stations, no one was. 
And will be maximal five delegate of the opposition in the parliament, and to be sure that that correspond at that soon to the presentations of the government. ' 
The quiet of the night sinks itself again over the October place. 
On television president Lukachenko and the members of the central choice commission to its success congratulate themselves. 
Conference - of the blood that again certain became 
Hema Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine DÃ©cary, had herself all reason to please, for Hema Quebec became one of the most certain and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And above all it recovered the confidence of the public, that heavily had been shaken through the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980 and '1990's. 
How one knows, the blood reserves administered national by the blood donation service the Canadian Red Cross had contaminated during the '1980's with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus. 
In view of this drama and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada initiated in February 1994 a public investigation led by the judge Horace Krever, that had as a goal of bringing light into the circumstances, that had led to such a tragedy, and guidelines to prepare, around a renewed catastrophe of this type to prevent. 
While judge Krever yet hesitated to deliver its report, several provinces placed at that time a committee on the legs whose goal it was of developing a new system to the administration of stored blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee GÃ©lineau fulfilled this order. 
After the reports of GÃ©lineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema Quebec that is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company in order to furnish the other provinces and both territories. 
`1998 when Hema Quebec received its work, had hardly 38% of the people confidence into the stored blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. DÃ©cary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
To improve through the enormous exertions around the security of the stored blood and through the work on this zone during the following years, we recovered the confidence of the public', say it before it emphasizes proudly, that beginning 2008 had meanwhile almost 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. 
Dr. DÃ©cary retains is however in the consciousness, that `Vertrauen somewhat extremely fragile'. 
Since its foundation on the 28th of September 1998, Hema Quebec acts after the principle of the caution. 
To this time of experienced we the appearance of numerous cases of the human form mad cow disease in Europe with, a new type of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-illness, tells this woman, that has in the direction since the foundation 1998. 
`Und we had not the slightest premonition whether this illness could be transmitted over the blood. 
Therefore we referred to one of the head guidelines of the reports of Krever and GÃ©lineau, that according to one from end measures uses, if one does not know this and if an illness only slowly advances, how it is obviously in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-illness the case, that expresses itself through a degeneration of the brain, what leads inevitable to death. 
Therefore one supposed in April 1999 no blood of persons, that had stayed since 1980 more long than a month in the united kingdom. 
Now, some years ago was proved without any doubt that this illness is transmitted over the blood. 
So showed us this event that the principle of the caution that we used has, thoroughly a sense. 
1999 appear a much more exact technology to the recognition of HIV on the market: The nucleic acids tests (NST), that it do not enable to prove directly in the blood of the donor the occurrence of the virus itself, and that of the antibody against the virus how it was in the previously related tests the case. 
The NST of enabled it that to shorten incubation time, that between the moment, to which the person was infected and that if the first viruses by our technologies in the blood proved will can, takes place, explains the specialist. 
This time could be reduced on a duration by less than a week. 
So the risk became not that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one this recognize could, diminishes substantially. 
These improvements of enabled it, that risk to transmit, AIDS over a blood transfusion, to sink in considerable mass. 
Nowadays runs one of 12 million persons danger to receive infected blood with HIV. 
`Mit other words is named that that one would have to distribute 12 million stored blood, before someone would be infected with HIV. 
Because Hema Quebec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 stored blood, it would last more than 24 years before a case appears, with which HIV became transmit over a stored blood. 
I believe that one probably can feel nowadays at the same time, if one gets or prescribes a blood transfusion to restore around the health', mean the direction boss of Hema Quebec. 
It that to receive security of our products is `Unsere challenge for the next ten years. 
One never knows, which pathogen can arrive into the system. 
Not until the past year the Chikungunya virus emerged on the island RÃ©union, that just as the west Nile virus is transmitted, by insects over the blood. 
We uninterruptedly must supervise', go Dr. DÃ©cary away before it emphasizes, that Hema Quebec must make available a sufficient provision next to a certain provision moreover. 
`Der requirement climbs because the population ages. 
Because the treatments to the cancer fight are more aggressive, the patients need often new red blood bodies or blood platelet. 
The over aging of the population affects also the blood donor network, to which in the average only 3% of the inhabitant of Quebec suitable to the blood donation belong. ' 
At the same time every healthy person, who more old is 18 years or and fulfills the fitness criteria, every 56 days, therefore six times per year can, contribute blood. 
In the average are not supposed 14% of the persons, that make available its blood, because they became ill for example with AIDS or malaria, and who traveled into a country, in which malaria is spread, becomes for a year of the blood donation excluded. 
We create `Mit this 3% it to receive an inventory, that corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking supplies are very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donor network if they more old can become and can contribute no more blood. 
It is to be held heavily to convince the people, to contribute, above all however, blood it and to bring it in addition, to become regular donors. 
Life is nowadays so hectically that one finds rarely the time to spend an hour in the blood donation', regrets Francine DÃ©cary. 
With a year budget of 297 million dollars, Hema Quebec delivers not only stored blood, but rather also human tissues, under that bone transplants, heart lids, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively in heavy fire injuries. 
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored between in Hema Quebec, that also the single public navel cord of blood bank Quebec administers. 
In the navel cord, that was observed earlier than a biomedical refuse, rich blood that can serve in addition is at stem cells, heavy illnesses, like for example leukemia, to treat. 
We celebrated `Vor some weeks the deposit of our thousandth navel cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease annually more than thousand. 
`Wir should begin probably beginning next year therewith to make available it for transplantation', explains decrease describes Dr. DÃ©cary further, that this program of the Nabelschnurblut- than very popularly. 
`Viele mothers are convinced to have no access in addition', for Hema Quebec are missing the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec.

`Ich am not yet ready, warned the Russian. 
I need another game so that I probably would feel. ' 
`Er fixed itself in the first half-time to very on that, noted Guy Carbonneau. 
But I believe, pleased it the end of the game. 
It received stormy approval. ' 
Charest sets on the north 
The prime minister does not exclude to initiate choices before end of the year. 
As soon as the general meeting of the liberal party was over, Jean Charest proceeded yesterday after Jean Talon in Quebec where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be selected in the current part choice. 
`Den course of our last large boundary in the north shift' : This is the long-term goal, that introduced Jean Charest yesterday with visual means in the general meeting of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, whereby it entirely the guidelines folgte. 
During its presentation, a type picture mill was projected behind it. 
On three gigantic screens, spectacular pictures of water power plants, mines revolved observes, of Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc. 
Large means such as during the choice period. 
Opposite of the press refused the prime minister by the way, to exclude that he will hold off the choices this autumn, also if he let be reported, that appointment calendars be would be very full. 
The `Plan north' the fourth element of a `Vision is', that the prime minister has nominally for Quebec, namely that of a `neuen economic region', that plans a unification with France regarding labor forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and unifications with Ontario. 
Although it was mentioned recently frequently in the speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the north - the northern zone on the 49sten latitude - never subject of a presentation had been. 
To explain the prime minister restricted themselves however on that why the north would be `ein jewel with enormous potential', no date, no investment sums or exact priorities named however for the coming projects. 
At most some outlooks on that on what more could be worked: Above all at the water energy, at the forest, but especially at the mining sector, favors through the growth of the threshold countries and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
The list according to Mr. Charests the north possesses `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'. 
This `Gebiet twice so largely like France' `ist in our vicinity, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', emphasized it to show like around clearly that it seeks to realize a national founder dream. 
Quebec grew very through its connection with the north, emphasized it: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James bay. 
`Es belongs to us, it is our future', joined it thereto after it had inserted a theatrical recess in order to observe the gigantic card behind itself. 
The north, 70% of the zone of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador with, the Quebec already always called for, explained the prime minister vis-Ã -vis the press. 
`Dies is a traditional bearing that all governments pursued. 
It gives a borderline, at which it gives since very long time no unification, if itself the opportunity become I offers this bearing in the name the government again take in', explained it. 
We newly must consider moreover, `mit the climate change our vision of the north', declared it and spoke over the north west passage, that will be passable based on the ice enamel the entire year. 
Before this new geopolitical background, the prime minister means that it would be quite a duty to occupy this zone. 
And the inhabitants of the zone, the native inhabitants and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would go around very carefully with them, and that they would profit from this project, above all the boys. 
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel LÃ©tourneau (former pekistischer delegate of Ungava) initiated already consultations in about thirty partnerships. 
A minister committee led by BenoÃ®t peel animal, in which Julie Boulet (carrier and mineral resources) takes in an important place, received the works. 
The prime minister does not exclude create becomes himself a large meeting, `nicht unconditionally a summit', but an opportunity, in the `man a joint vision'. 
The development of the north will proceed in the remaining in agreement with the principles of the persistent development. 
The plan north becomes `besprochen, regulated and be environmentally friendly', promised it. 
Jean Charest described this `Vision' as if it would be a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers, that were before it in the office. 
`Wie the liberals, that were before us in the office, rethink we in order to change the challenges into new growths and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was by the way one of the subjects turned-up again and again of the weekend that was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the acceptance the party leadership by Jean Lesage. 
One of the supposed decisions plans to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in AdÃ©lard-Godbout-obstruction dam. 
`Von Godbout that Hydro Quebec created, over Lesage, that the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity reached, to Bourassa, that the James bay made to determine knew our party always, the future', explained Jean Charest. 
Vis-Ã -vis the press it made reference to another, this time conservative intention, and to be sure on the program `Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker, prime minister of 1957 until 1963. 
With regard to the project water power obstruction dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, emphasizes Mr. Charest, that would be planned its starting for 2012. 
`Das remains under us, but I have before, at the same time to its', trusted it its party members on, what evoked in those approval storms. 
The prime minister who said in April, that it would give 2008, and certainly also 2009, no choices, did not exclude in the deed the possibility to hold off this autumn a choice, what is possible it of the law here, yet. 
It emphasizes that its appointment calendar is full however, above all because of a mission of the partnership advice in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party chief a platform out of nationalistic plans, above all out of `die constitution relevant goals', that were supposed readily: The PLQ demands very especially the recognition of the `Besonderheit of Quebec' in the constitution. 
It would like also that Quebec of members of the advice appoints the Canadian broadcast and telecommunications, and that these possess a veto regarding that in Quebec gefÃ¤llten decisions. 
Of sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the plan were received north with scepticism. 
The boss of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, Pauline Marois, got forth the politics to the development of the north-you-Quebec again, that the government Landry 2001 introduced. 
Loudly you have the liberal government when it came 2003 at the power, on that renounced to use this. 
If it had done it, `wÃ¤ren we today already much further', judged woman Marois at the side of its candidate in Jean Talon (where the choice today takes place) FranÃ§oise Mercure. 
The ADQ expressed itself for that to support the acceptance of a plan north through the government. 
`Aber what we want, is, becomes that this not only a large presentation', declared of the party leader SÃ©bastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, that returns today out of the vacation. 
Letter - a disgraced country 
Mr. Vic Toews, former' justice' -minister (what irony) in the cabinet Harper it that permitted itself last summer was, to say over Louise Arbour, it would be a `Schande' for Canada. 
This woman, the one do not end led has wanting battle for the justice and earns all our admiration to cover so with disgrace, says just as much over the persons around the prime minister around from, like over Stephen Parker itself. 
We have it here with a government to do, that did not get its compatriot caught in the concentration camp Guantanamo as only out of all the concerned countries home. 
A government that does not consider once that Omar Khadr was another youth, when the things happened, that are reproached for it. 
The single government, that in spite of the fact that Canada the Genevans convention signs has, its word breaks and vegetate there lets a child soldier under inhuman conditions. 
The only, that lets out here itself to a justice parody, in order to estimate the guilt of the accused. 
Let's call us in memory that above all UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian lawyers plead for that to get Omar Khadr home so that he gets a just process in Canada. 
Exactly this government locks also the eyes before the torture: It interests it few that a young more adult after so many years of the torment certainly for always mentally broken be becomes. 
We are not ourselves its yet aware, but we experience sounds here just an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our `Demokratie', this word, that carries Harper permanently like a flag before itself here, and that out of its mouth so meaningless. 
The time came therefore, in which it gives no moral at all more: One arbitrarily may mistreat, torture and lock in a Canadian citizen, becomes may belong entirely at discretion of a head of the government, that until today only of the minority supported (he after the 14th of October entirely the minority. ..). 
Many voters believe to find its well-being at a party, that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government renounced itself of that, what the call and that would become our country settled. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere differently. 
Free opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold 
In its edition of the 17th of September, Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice general director of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and an orwellsche logic pursues strove for, with the goal, to open at the same time, that the largest gold winning company of the world a slander complaint over six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house a `Ã¶ffentliche transparent debate'. 
If it agrees, that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge over the truth, above all not in the case of slander complaints, but rather over the law. 
How expects, this basic difference was concealed of Mr. Garver totally. 
For for Barrick gold, the best type is to be led a public debate to drive every into the ruin, that ventures it to represented one of that its opposed opinions. 
Very same, how the process goes out, the authors and the publisher of the beech Noir Canada considerable sums will have to issue in order to prepare its defense and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers, that are paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactic in these unequal fights is in the remaining often to ruin the defenders, in order to force an amicable regulation, that makes the opposite side mouth dead and deters moreover everyone, that it ventures to concern itself again with the question. 
If Barrick gold wanted really a public debate, it should have presented its visibility of the things before the public opinion. 
In contrast to that, what in many of the countries, in which Barrick gold works, perfectly acceptable is, debates become not in Canada normally through the exchange of ideas and through club blows expedited. 
It would have sufficed therefore if the gold mine would have disclosed its books and acts and would have opened an actual debate, through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams, that would have been able to bring light into this question. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence into the public opinion and wipes the petition and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside. 
Could Mr. Garver explain perhaps how he can ask simultaneously for a `Ã¶ffentliche' debate and at the same time yet the opinions neglect just this public? 
Apparently comprised this word in the world of the vice president only the generously paid lawyers, and not the partnership of all Canadian; an entirely quite cramped visibility manner of the concept. 
In a democracy, even Verleumder are right the to speak. 
What - or not not understand wants - is understands Barrick gold, that the public, that the authors and publisher of Noir Canada supports, does, this above all therefore, because it rejects the brutal bearing of the gold mine. 
This public is not civilized perceive arranged in addition ready to listen and to judge Barrick, but on the basis one exchange of arguments, and in a frame, that many as a gag complaint (in the course of the `Ã¶ffentlichen debate' Barrick gold just a demand on the authors of Noir Canada, in whom it demands by them to use this concept no longer. ..). 
Apart from the surrealen speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the establishment of the truth that are basic for each democratic society. 
It denies totally the right to quote plausible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, that form the basis of the intellectual work. 
Is if it impossible in a country such as Canada not please to investigate and to discuss subjects, that the rich businesses of this world, can do who otherwise that then? 
If Barrick gold wanted really a public and transparent debate, it could lead this in that it follows the scientific standards, that were used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
It is right a to answer. 
The university background to which we belong, knows for some time to get debates and inconsistencies into the handle and to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it has, in contrast to that, what purports it, no desire on a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world just as for the public debate, and it time becomes that the governments seize measures, that restrict this type of unjustified complaints. 
Rescue operation for the Wall Street - democrats and republican understand itself 
The administration Bush and the leading congresswomen, republican and democrats likewise, came yesterday finally to a unification over the most extensive economy rescue plan since the large depression of the '30's. 
The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars that should stop the finance crisis, that already since months the Wall Street shaken, must be supposed yet by both congress chambers. 
The head contents are: A better inspection of the delegate over the practical use of the plan, new mechanisms in order to secure the repayment of the used public moneys, new decrees in order to dam the amount of the houses seized on the basis of payment residues, as well as the right to supervise the salaries, that are paid at the leading employees of the supported businesses. 
The American finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the delegate chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative present in the negotiations of the republican, senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, some minutes after midnight, the good novelty, after a two-day negotiation marathon. 
`Wir made large progress toward a unification, becomes that market effective its', explained the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
`Es happened all to protect around which real economy and the American people against the course crisis at the Wall Street', explained the democrat. 
`Dies is the basic point: If we do not do that, become the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily life of the American be enormous', explained the republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had sped up during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect, that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. 
The time period that had been arranged was the market opening today morning. 
Both American presidency candidate, who were involved first late in the negotiations, appeared sooner than an advocate of the unification without neglecting however, to express its discontent about that that one had to encounter it in this extreme manner. 
The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain decrees to the unification, above all such, that should enable it the owners to retain its houses, and such that concern the salaries of the leading employees of the business rescued by the country. 
`Wenn one the taxpayers therefore asks to seize based on the irresponsibility of certain persons extraordinary measures, is that nothing why one could congratulate himself. 
But these measures are necessary', explained it on the American television stations. 
When it was asked on one other transmitter, whether it will agree for the proposed plan, its republican opponent John McCain answered: `Ich would know gladly first the details, but I hope it. 
`Die guiding principles that I read that this is a thing, that we will have to digest everyone, and with that we will be able to make headway. 
The option to do nothing at all, is very simply not acceptable', said it. 
The 700 billions of dollar plan is aligned on that, with the money of the taxpayer 
It comes 14 months after a crisis, through which bursting of a real estate bubble released, that led first of all to the breakdown of the very risky mortgage credit (Subprime), before they expanded (PCAA) itself on further forms more common loans, and flowed in the end into a freezing of the financial power and into the ruin of the banks and money institutes. 
It, that let fail last week the first attempt to the unification, was a group of republican delegate. 
Since the democrats accepted, that certain `giftige are supposed to be secured and not bought' assets of the companies in oppression only by the government, one believes escape himself the dead end. 
In order to round off the points of view for all in the congress, one added also a decree, raise could that purports that, if the government with this program should make losses within five years, it then new taxes in order to get back so its used capital. 
The new plan plans the payment of a first sum of 250 billions, to which further 100 billions can arrive, if the president looks at it for compel. 
The payment of further 350 billions must be dismissed in a renewed voting by the congress. 
In return for its aid, Washington receives sell can shares in the supported businesses, that bring in it in the case of profits dividends, and that it again if the storm is pulled past. 
The Federal Government will have the possibility, the seizure procedures regarding the dwellings, that are tied to the real estate credit concerned by this plan, to delay, and to fix moreover time periods for the repayment and the settlements, that are paid at the leading employees of the concerned businesses. 
The developers of the plan would have it gladly that the delegate chamber votes already today over it, and the senate then on Wednesday. 
In spite of all its efforts is not certain yet that its plan will get green light. 
Actually further voices against this intention raised themselves yesterday, both of sides of the republican and the democrats. 
`Ganz obviously does not understand us Washington', explained the republican Scott Garett, member of the finance commission of the chamber, its voters. 
`Ja, we have a large financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not that that exists therein to ask the taxpayers to the cash register'. 
The democratic delegate Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the congress, who is named `der Kaukus of the skeptic', represents the things differently, comes however to the same conclusion. 
Economy professors excellent `Vierhundert, under that three noble prize winners, wrote us in order to announce us to: We ask is the congress to not to be pressured, and to consider carefully, to hit which way', explained it yesterday. 
To the same time, we got the proof in Europe again that it concerns a worldwide crisis. 
In an emergency meeting, the three BeneluxlÃ¤nder announced that partially nationalization of the bank group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euro (16.3 billions of U.S. dollar). 
The intervening of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessarily after the French bank BNP Paribas announced, that she would renounce on that to buy up its competitor, who is in large difficulties, since she lost 2 billions of Euro (2.9 billions of U.S. dollar) in the crisis through the very risky real estate credit in the United States. 
Fortis busies 85,000 persons and belongs to the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
'That is no lost money, explained yesterday the Dutch Treasury Minister Wouter Bos. 
To the balance let's receive a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is announce itself exact that what the savers and households appreciate, now there unsteady times. ' 
While this time the British government was on the other side of the sleeve canal just there to nationalize another bank brought by the finance crisis in oppression. 
Loud the English press the government would receive all running credit in the bank Bradford and Bringley, therefrom over 41 billion (75.5 billions U.S. dollar) out of real estate credit. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branch and the customer accounts of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would be after Northern skirt the second bank that the British government must nationalize since the beginning of this finance crisis. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of an engaged icon 
Its beauty with the azure eyes was long time its trump, no one would say, its weakness. 
Had the American actor with the charming smile of the narcissistic mirror freed himself? 
Yes and no. 
Its tact, its sensitivity and an obvious talent kept away it probably just as of a power position, that the really terrible monsters to the world brings.

In contrast to several movie theater legends, that withdrew early enough out of the film world, should Newman long in the saddle remain, and at the same time Hollywood, be fortune, its Prunk and its concession betray. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it, without humor, when living challenge at the `Underplaying', when he did not judge its all too print out strong achievements. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, that the rolls flyed long time only so. 
It played however rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: Neurotic, alcoholic, Fieslinge or doubted with whose perfect representation he reflected its gliding off and its Auflehnung. 
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of its true sensitive sensitivity. 
Its Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle woman portrait of full melancholy. 
It, that lost its son Scott through an overdose, dedicated its film Harry and Son, a work of tact full and sadness to this 1984. 
In the flood of distinctions, that poured yesterday over Newman declared its close friend and earlier weapon companion Robert Redford (it had together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid played) extremely seized: `Seine present has my life and this country verbessert.' 
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor. 
Apart from its legendary career, also a large advocate of the civil rights, the environmental protection and the independent movie theater, an opponent of the drifting away Hollywoods indicates now,. 
We have stand see it probably often with the foot in scarves fully Vinaigrette, in Saucen, pastry or other groceries, and this for rather tasteless held although we found it originally yet amusingly. 
The profits out of its revenues flowed nevertheless into its foundation for children in need. 
Instead of resting itself on its myth, Newman engaged itself to the shot. 
It left behind a letter with these sentences to its five daughters: `Immer and until entire to the end your father was incredibly grateful for its good star. 
It was an honor to be allowed to be here. ' 
And for us, it was an honor to be allowed to pursue life of a so intelligent and generous American actor. 
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the broadest sense. 
What became produced into the calculation factory of extra charge &amp; Co.? 
On the 8th of October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against JÃ¡nos extra charge and its accomplices begin. 
Especially the participation in the organized crime is reproached the accused, as well as coarsely careless damage and business fraud, and other punishable offenses - among other things document forgery -. 
According to district attorney's office, that were used out of the announcements lukrierten means for own purposes, attained covers became achievements during that often with falsified calculations. 
National moneys and subsidies of the autonomy - altogether HOOVES 65 Mio - are supposed to have flowed partly into the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private cash registers more single. 
How the issuing authorities announced, fictional calculations were produced in the relating of the announcement moneys, and the societies not also are supposed to be come later its duties. 
According to accusation writing, a large part of the calculations should have been falsified. 
The calculation blocks were bought at the market of JÃ³zsefvÃ¡ros, one let prepare the round seals in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision about that, on which firms the calculations are supposed to be issued, was decided on that round trip north of the disk lake, on which IstvÃ¡n Lados was sent by JÃ¡nos extra charge. 
In the train of this "reconnaissance tour", Lados pension and restaurants foundly should make. 
It demanded calculations over the Konsumationen in order to be able to issue later on these models being based calculations for the youth ministry and sport ministry, that socially and Department of Labor, as well as the autonomy of Budapest. 
These calculations should have been manipulated by a majority by IstvÃ¡n Lados and its accomplice, AndrÃ¡s whereby more latter after our information for the constitution of the corresponding reports been responsible be should. 
One of the goals of Lados' "reconnaissance tour" was a beer local. 
How two of extra charge and Co in 2003 issued calculations is to be taken, the gastronomy business should have the ninety headed group of the society Biztos Pont EgyesÃ¼let bewirtet. 
Now the boss of the business does not give away locally would have fit however on, a so large group all at once in that. 
Another calculation, issued in the summer 2002 on the foundation Jobb later well known as an EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt, showed also serious form mistakes and contents mistakes. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, that controls solely three rooms and not simultaneously can harbor more than ten persons, should have stayed according to calculation of 130 guests. 
The imagination of the calculation counterfeiter no boundaries were set obviously just as when it concerned the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy business in whose accounting documents of the customers seem up Jobb and HoppÃ¡ according to accusation authority not at all first. 
How manager Farkas of the hvg. hu announced, was immediately clearly that it concerned falsified documents, to it when it by the district attorney's office during an inquiry documents were produced. 
"Our firm name and the tax number incorrectly were mounted" on the stamp. 
And further: Apart from irregularities, also the fact was incorrectly that the business one hundred persons should have harbored, after they have altogether eleven rooms, that offer place to impossibly so many persons. 
Also provisions had been on the calculation cited, would be there the restaurant for some time time no longer in operation. 
The busy calculation counterfeiters neglected also, to review that the Budapester travel agency taken by them into the visor offers excluding trips abroad, and so they indicated Hungary trips on the bar payment calculation, what contradicted the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the firm also. 
How in the course of the ascertainments well known became, they cited in addition on the calculations also the value-added tax although travel agency achievements, that have references to a country outside of the EU, are, value-addedtax-free. 
The height of the value-added tax was altogether on four of the hotel RÃ©vfÃ¼lÃ¶p Kft. at the foundation Jobb issued calculations incorrect because the business reckons instead of 25 only 15 percent sales tax, moreover become of the colleagues exclusively machine calculations issued, the falsified documents were however handwritten. 
A further mistake, that was slip in the "Rechnungslegern", was that, that it in a case "its carrier" than attained achievement indicated had although this is not offered by the firm specialized on Investmentberatung, divided the district attorney's office with. 
Further irregularities - incorrect calculation format, incorrect stamp - was to be owed that that at EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, as well as at XXI. SzÃ¡zadi KulturÃ¡lis EgyesÃ¼let and Biztos Pont issued calculations as a forgery exposed become could. 
Just as in the case the Ravenna Bt. and the sport warehouse KunfehÃ©rtÃ³ whose managers assured to never to have issued the calculations. 
Another "mistake" is the counterfeiters in that HAD Kft. out of NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za slip in: This company was at present (2001) namely just in solution when the group of the Fiatal VÃ¡rosÃ©rt EgyesÃ¼let should have eaten there - the mass administrator gave consequently on to not to have issued the calculations themselves. 
Deliberately falsified 
Persons who was thoroughly aware are the other group of the Rechnungsleger, that they would have to put fictional calculations. 
On requesting of the Fiatal Baloldal - the foundation EsÃ©ly BudapestÃ©rt AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny calculations issued IfjÃº SzocialistÃ¡k for the foundation EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt, in a height of about HOOVES 4 million. 
According to accusation writing, the manager of the Collab Kft was persuaded. of one of the accused, Ludovic GyÃ¶rfi, to the display of the fictional calculations. 
The Biogate Kft present momentarily also in liquidation. should have collaborated also with extra charge and Co. : In 2003, the gmbh should have furnished the foundation Jobb AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, as well as the societies Atlasz EgyesÃ¼let and EgyesÃ¼let with falsified calculations in the total value of HOOVES 5 million, attained related itself that on not achievements. 
There was however just as little payment traffic because the calculations were cancelled directly after its display, what the concerned in its documents to note forgotten have however. 
The third group of the Rechnungsleger comprises persons who are connected directly with the accused. 
IvÃ¡n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta TriÃ³ Kft., one in Budapest of resident is one of them, there however not detectable fuel firm and vehicle trade firm. 
This firm should have issued several calculations in the period from October to December 2005 over the sale of EDP components in the total value of HOOVES about 18 million. 
According to issuing authority, the cash present since the 14th of September 2005 in liquidation Investment Kft should have functioned. out of Kiskunhalas as a buyer of these calculations. 
Manager of this firm was a Rumanian, whom the firm documents should be delivered also by IvÃ¡n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
After our information, Kubatov stood during the ascertainments, issued calculations in the name of the gmbh. at the societies Atlasz and HoppÃ¡, as well as at EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny and to have collected its value itself. 
The firms Fa Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos Investment Bt. should have been established by Romanian masons on IvÃ¡n Kubatovs specific wish there. 
In truth however was no these firms active, what lay according to accused at lacking orders. 
Nevertheless it was able to profit from the businesses: On requesting of its accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, that was delegated with the preparation of the firm foundation documents, he issued in the name of the firms calculations at the societies brought with extra charge in connection, like about at Atlasz and Y GenerÃ¡ciÃ³. 
Altogether Kubatov should have issued 15 calculations in the total value of HOOVES 14.2 million in the name of the firms cash Investment, Delta TriÃ³, Fa Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade at the organizations. 
The district attorney's office assumes that Kubatov of respectively 10% the calculation sum as well as the value-added tax could have collected. 
Kubatov should have abused even the firm Szi Beri Bt. for the display of fictional calculations - in this case were enclosed the calculations the applications of Biztos Pont. 
The firm Y GenerÃ¡ciÃ³ and SzÃ¶vetsÃ©g a in a modern manner MagyarorszÃ¡gÃ©rt in January 2006 delivered its application in the public-spirited organization of the socialistic party, TÃ¡ncsics MihÃ¡ly AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny ("TMA"). 
Both received 500,000 Forint apiece, utilized these sums however purpose alienated. 
In order to gloss over this, they have cause produced the TMA five fictional calculations of that team Kft.. 
These calculations were guaranteed by the way in the search of the office of ÃrpÃ¡d Kemecsei in the instruction ministry. 
In the negotiations becomes now of some accused with an admission over the procedure of the calculation forgery how they were discarded already before the district attorney's office, calculated. 
A sensation could be if the head accusation JÃ¡nos extra charge to a comprehensive admission decides. 
Its previous statements were detailed namely fewer, and although it had accepted already repeatedly to report comprehensively over all, stands its admission yet from. 
The question remains therefore openly whether this lies in its interest, whether the socialists locked a pact with it regarding the reparation of the large part of the emerged damage of HOOVES 50 million, and whether extra charge is in return ready to accept the responsibility. 
It is however thoroughly possible that extra charge plays now the "insulted", after its petitions on mitigation of the arrest and house arrest were bumped into deaf ears. 
During other criminal, that caused major damage with economy offense far and did not compensate this, stand at liberty, or at least under house arrest, remains forbids extra charge this possibility. 
The psychology of the surpassing - or why we are ready to pay more 
In auction, the buyers tend in addition to issue more and to overvalue the file offered therefore. 
It is arrive neurologists and economy researchers of the university of New York now, confessed the neurological economical bases this and to discover apparently irrational behavior. 
Loudly a study published in the "Science" magazine the persons in a competition want themselves how about an auction on eBAY, not struck give and are therefore ready, even superelevated to pay prices. 
The researchers tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteer should play lottery, participated during the other in a playful action - in both cases were examined the active brain regions of the test subjects by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
In both games, the participants were able to win money, to be sure became an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex beneath the brain cows, with losers of the auction measured, with which the surpassing of the opponent plays an essential role. 
Next to many other functions, this brain region is for that "itself reward" of the nerve system responsible. 
The researchers meant therefore, the price increase could be explained through the avoidance of an over reaction of the Striatums. 
In order to bolster its thesis, the economists in the researcher group engaged in addition investigations to the after pursuit of the money. 
In this case, three groups against a partner should offer with under different conditions. 
The true value of the product was announced the control group, made after that it its uses. 
Another group 15 dollars reward were promised in addition, for which case that they follow as a winner out of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, that were lost in the case a lost game also. 
The difference between both groups existed therefore solely therein that the emphasis was about the one on the winning, while in the other on the losing. 
As a proof of the hypotheses expressed by neurologists, the members of the group playing "against the losing" to higher uses were however ready, than that in the control and/or the "profit" -group. 
"These results can be derived from no earlier economy theory. 
These established namely the manners observed in auction until now only with the joy at the winning, and/or the risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between both theories was dissolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, have so that we now a third explanation ready" - meant Andrew crushed rock, professor of the economy faculty of the university of New York. 
Hepatitis: When is the physician to be searched for? 
Worldwide suffer is listed round a half billion of person from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease under the leading causes of death. 
The number of the infected is estimated in this country to be hundred thousand, become treated to be sure only seven thousand what lies, that the patients often do not know, that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the collecting concept for liver diseases released, infectious by different viruses. 
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are frequent, to be sure the pathogens and the illnesses differ from one another. 
According to pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread on two different types: in hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example through polluted groceries or water), in hepatitis B, C and D the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (like about sperm, sheath secretion or saliva). 
Traveling is recommended a vaccination against the viruses A and B in any case, gives against the viruses C it no vaccine. 
The symptoms in hepatitis A appear polluted about two three weeks after consumption the groceries and are accompanied in general of unwell condition, weakness, stomach ache and breach attraction. 
After that steps the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes up, the chair becomes brightly, the urine darkly, and the recovery can last up to two for three weeks. 
Worldwide annually about 1 million of person at the diseases released, far heavier by hepatitis B such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis dies. 
Main reason for this is that according to estimations only every infected tenth in medicinal treatment is. 
Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: it untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most infected do not know destroys over its disease, there once the pathogen the liver cell insidious - in many cases appear the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
Therefore timely preventing is, like about regular examinations, indispensably. 
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequent: that, that subjected itself before 1991 of a blood transfusion, drug-addicted, and tattooed. 
Presently the amount of that is estimated at chronic hepatitis C become ill worldwide to be 200 millions. 
Because the illness is demonstrable already in a routine laboratory investigation, to search for is it advisable, in the first signs of unknown origin the family doctor. 
On time recognized, is the illness curable, the virus can be eradicated by what means the risk of infection is banned and is prevented the origin of cancer. 
The 30th of September is arranged the world days of hepatitis, 2004 for the first time of patient representations worldwide. 
It, that consciousness for this hepatitis caused chronic by viruses to strengthen, its origin and the meaning of the early recognition, is goal of the action. 
Do believings less of pain have? 
How newest research results cover, that the belief religious such as a type "analgesic" would cause, that should have eased already death of Catholic martyr. 
Scientists of the Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined to what extent the belief influences the Schmerzempfinden of the person at God, reported the British leaf "telegraph". 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, ever 12 believing and atheists of electro shock received while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
How the results showed, the believings were able to turn off the large part of the pains. 
By means of a brain Scan technology even could be proved that the Catholics were able to activate the part of its brain, that is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was that not until a research project at which next to scientists also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university participate. 
In the attempt, a twinkling device was tied up the test subject at the left hand, which delivered the electro shock. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To the one a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis "lady with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped that the view of the virgin Maria would evoke under the believing trances religious a type, while they selected there Vincis picture, because it differed hardly by the other painting and was perceived as calming. 
The test subjects of spent a half hour apiece in a MRI scanner, and received look at should in this time of altogether 20 electro shock in four stages, during it either the religious, or the other painting. 
The Catholics reported, they would have felt in the view of the mother of God "in security" as if they would be "umsorgt", and they would have perceived "quiet and peace". 
During the observing of the religious painting, they reported over 12% less of pain as if they had Leonardos work before eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that participated also in the attempt meant, one could evoke similar effects also with other, strongly causing pictures also at the atheists, one would have to find merely the corresponding photo. 
"We must a picture find, that very positive perceptions releases, like about a mother or a father", so the psychologist. 
The anglikanische bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practiceing of the Glaubens should our personality change, and does it also in many cases", so Wright. 
After these outstanding results, the question remains only which effect a madonna picture would have Leonardos or another comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believing. 
Would the qualitatively high-value virgin Maria obtain even better results? 
You are, yourself you announce over you 
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can justifiably maintain: it is to be found in the pockets of the persons just as, like over its beheading in the sky: It knows where the persons spent its vacation, to which specialty physicians they go, and what moves it. 
And therewith still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the manager of Google. 
Toward skeptic, who are plagued by Orwellschen horror visions, he lets align: These would survey just the essential of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the financial Times, Schmidt meant would be recently, the main goal of Google it to gather yet more personal data over the users and to come so the original objective of the firm more closely according to what it wanted organize" "all information of this world. 
Schmidt explained, let Google be after ten years of world changing work still first at the start of the information gathering. 
Ask meant about the status Quo in five years Schmidt: he wished for, Google would be in a position, questions such as "what should I tomorrow do?" or "which job fits really to me?" to answer, to be sure would be software program not yet in a position in addition because it would know not enough over the users. 
All Internets users are not themselves about that in the clear that in the train of its Internet investigation the that which is sought concepts would be registered, as well as also the IP ADDRESSES of which out of sought became, and the visited sides. 
To store for example the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" permitted the visitor its own that which is sought course and to fall back later on that so that the hits can be generated later much more precise, and on the same logic also the so named "Recommendations", with which the system recommends products tailor-made and services based on the earlier preferences, are based. 
The users ask happens - "if one checks, what I make" - appear provides to be sure, what in the case a data abuse themselves some whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases, it is however sooner the power represented, potential by the firm that causes fear exciting, and fewer the compunction or the fear of punishment, that striving after freedom or the rebellion against the power, that bumps at many Internets users into rejection. 
It is to be sure a proved fact that the that which is sought concepts not only stored, but rather in the occasion case also at third transmitted become, and in these law cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. 
A prime example for this was submitted lately the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the train its Google of the Brazilian government information, that were gathered by the partnership sites by the name of "Orkut", and also an identification of the pedophilias of enabled. 
Users concerned around personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief however yet in May, pulled when Google jointly with the civil right organization EFF successfully against the FBI before court: accordingly can Google also in the future with no point of the constitution in addition forced become to publish information the FBI on secret inquiry. 
(To be sure has the Federal Government successfully the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 that which is sought concepts with reference to the years ago dismissed child and youth protection legislation obtains, to be sure became its the list of the single user, or its Web list and that which is sought concept list on two months retroactively withhold). 
Googles image remains therefore disputed: That that publish its personal data unwillingly because they fear the loss of its privacy and IntimsphÃ¤re through the use of the google services, scourges the business with that the of firms conservatively representing itself proper rebellion. 
Meanwhile the American "Geek culture" sees that is present in many countries and enthused computer fans, activists and user eint, that next generation of the "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to windows market leader, also if both fight for the same goal. 
A possible reason for this is that Google demands its user in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and makes available its services free of charge so that an open source code permanently updated and program Package seem to be far more attractively, more youthfully and more coolly, than the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand the Geeks look through the problematic ratio of the personal rights and the Internet razor-sharply - a ratio that is moved especially in the past years thanks to the concept "Web 2.0" into the midpoint. 
In the "Web 2.0", it concerns leave behind namely nothing of other, when around Kollaboration, sprich, the users intentionally traces and utilize the available communication canals, and also if the sizes are individually different, the essential matter remains that, namely itself publicly to show. 
An average youth can be administer simultaneously on several partnership portals profile - of Facebook over Xanga, can read interconnect can bind this by means of other services, like about Twitter, or music services how. fm, and all this in the end into an after pursuit system such as about FriendFeed or Blip. fm. In addition they can lead blogs, that automatically represent the newest photo galleries, that are on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a row of further exemplary cases proves: In the observing of the party photos of the past night, the friend will find out soon, with whom its unfaithful friend amused himself, or the colleague will release because he makes in its blog only all too honestly its vexation at the business management air - one is certain: The concept "privacy" completely newly was interpreted meanwhile. 
Who leads an Online life, is that, what it of itself sacrifices - so in about could formulate one the reason idea behind the behavior of the current youth. 
And who tries to hold somewhat secretly, or to go around quite the google monopoly, can do that gladly - like about with Scroogle, a tool, that take action to be sure on the search engine of Google, to be sure intentionally no traces leaves behind. 
Few persons do not register intentionally not on partnership sides so that they are not detectable, but also the Online applications of Google, like about word-processings and graphic tools and RSS Feeds, let themselves go around with alternative versions, that are tied to no gigantic server parks and do not generate therefore also the optimum profile of the user. 
The public opinion waits banned meanwhile on that until Google shows its true face. 
With its present value of USD 156 billions the business lies threaten the receipts of the advertising agencies even before IBM (USD 140 billions), Intel (USD 124 billions) or Coca Cola (USD 110 billions), the advertise areas of AdWords/AdSense, and not only Microsoft prepare the always faster introduced services, but rather also other software developer worry. 
Critical spectators find to be sure also the disturbing against poles: So about the group direction completely rejected a protest of the colleague after the fees of the firm inclined kindergarten were doubled, moreover the management, the multiple provisions of the colleague meant would be too costly. That everything seems however quite mildly on the other hand that Google in 2006 went before the Chinese government even into the knees and was agreed with an agreement according to what all regime critical hits would be filtered out, or that that violate the good taste. 
The internal regulation of the group reads that in advance no new service is applied, but rather is first if this also already available. Nevertheless the events of the coming months and years strongly could change radically again a few things: During some my, Googles book and Magazinscan- and/or archiving project would suppose meanwhile sizes that the business would have to explain itself soon with the waiter court, are disturbed other rather because of the system "Health", that enables the creation of a complete health profile on the basis of conditions, physicians and problems. 
And the fact that Google constructs a genetic database, delivers the next generation of the Sci Fi authors already the material - about "Scroogled", that famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellschen manner a future in which a person becomes thanks to data related by Google frightening closely cash. 
Two youths help the double murderer of Ãzd in the trace removal 
In connection with the double murder of Ãzd, the police interrogated now two youths, who stand under suspicion to have helped in the removal of the traces, divided the speaker of the police commissioner's office Borsod on Tuesday with. 
The youths were be accused gestÃ¤ndig, presently it the aid. 
According to information from the news agency MTI concerns it two girls, who defend herself at liberty. 
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years. 
The suspect of the double murder of Ãzd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken on Sunday in detention.

The suspect did not want to settle its guilt however, attracted therefore he its creditor at the past Wednesday on a terrain in Ãzd where he murdered it and its nine year old daughter. 
According to the MTI, the man planned the deed of long hand - this proves also the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene. 
Jointly with experts, the police examines now the weapon as well as the circumstances of its use. 
Resident of Warsaw stock exchange puts purchase offer for citizen of Prague stock exchange 
Approximately 200 million of Euro, or 5 billions of Czech crowns stock exchange offered the Residents of Warsaw for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the citizen of Prague stock exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Residents of Warsaw stock exchange, strengthened the offer, that the Poland had put in spite of the fact, that they were excluded earlier by the Czechs than possible owners of its stock exchange. 
Reason is that the Residents of Warsaw belongs stock exchange completely to the country. 
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish country, that to be sure more wants to sell than 60% of the papers in the coming months. 
After messages of the Czech daily newspaper âE15" the offer of the Poland includes the previously highest purchase price that was offered ever for the citizens of Prague to stock exchange. 
How the newspaper reports, have stock exchange until now the Viennese, that Nasdaq Transatlantic, that New York cane Exchange, that Londoners put stock exchange and the German Stock Exchange offer. 
Petr Koblic, boss of the citizen of Prague stock exchange said past week that of all the interested parties the Residents of Warsaw would be stock exchange well the worst new owner, and he concluded also not from that that in the future could lead even to the closing of the citizen of Prague stock exchange. 
Market experts estimate the value of the citizen of Prague stock exchange to be 5-10 billion crowns. 
According to come off of the stockholders could be sold 90% of the shares. 
Largest owner of the citizen of Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a 25 percent participation, followed of the CeskÃ¡ Sporitelna bank with 14.7 and the tiger holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent. 
The finance crisis of from the viewpoint European newspapers 
In its the finance crisis always further sharpening international itself dedicated commentaries some leading European leaves spoke on Tuesday already by the "second 11th of September". 
We have the global finance catastrophe the American president to owe, meant about "La Repubblica" - the president had not been in a position once, bring should its own party for the bill behind itself to one, that something relief into the frightening situation... 
Instead of one "new Pearl Harbor" how the billion heavy investor Warren Buffett named it, would be it more appropriate to speak about a "second 11th of September". 
Parts of the press in Madrid locate the scapegoat also in Washington. 
In the opinion of the "el Mundo" is the missing political leadership guilt that the international economy is now at the edge of the breakdown. 
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and under that the entire world will suffer. 
Bushs plan was threatens to be sure not perfect, now however after the voting in the congress the danger that Washington has no political means to the crisis management ready. 
The international economy hangs in the air, and to be sure just at a time because one of the largest transformation of the story the capitalism takes place. 
One can let the threat no longer except respect, means about the Genevan of "day indicator". 
Yet many countries could make available rescue to be sure its of money institutes advised into the wavering rescue packages, and the banks with the money of the taxpayer before the bankruptcy. 
A Dominoeffekt is released to be sure and go it yet more banks broke, help neither further financial shots in the arm, yet other urgent measure. 
Long-termed the EUS member countries would have to jump over its shadow and would have to centralize the inspection over the money markets. 
Alone on Monday more were paid out than EUR 100 billions to weakening money institutes, remembers the Viennese "the standard". Moreover, so the newspaper further, would be the objections always more realistic that after the Americans now also the European taxpayers would have to grasp somewhat deeper into its pockets in order to come out out of the crisis. 
Until now the EU did not explain itself seriously with the crisis, that sweeps now like a tsunami over the old continents. 
The "rescuers" must to be sure not immediately with several hundred billion Euro "fronds" to hold it would be however advisable,, in which case it sensibly would be, to grasp the money of the taxpayer, in order to turn away one yet major damage. 
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What would the best method to the development of new technologies to the accident avoidance be if the hindrances sensors to not to imitate out of nature? 
For example that of the bees. 
In the CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was introduced, with which the Nissan engineers were inspired accident of new by bumblebee in the Erschaffung avoiding systems. 
In collaboration with the Tokioter university, Nissan constructed the biomimetische system driven by car robots of the type BR23C, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with which goal to support, the development of a system, that avoids each collision. 
In the flight forms each bee its own, oval "private area", that is very similar our own "protection to sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, in the display. 
The put together eye of the bee, that can see into each direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays at the same time an important role. 
In order to imitate the function of the put together eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser driven distance knife. 
This identifies hindrances before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals at the microprocessor at Board, that initiates immediately the kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The hindrance is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot changes immediately the course, similarly the movement of the bees in that it turns the tires around the corresponding angle. 
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively. 
"If it not so would be, could the car robot not quickly enough react, around the hindrances to avoid", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project. 
The system must instinctively and immediately react, corresponds there this technology to the most internal and most vulnerable part of the protection sign - a layer within which accidents count presently yet as unavoidable. 
The total process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they avoid other bees. 
And that must expire in the fraction of a second. 
To be sure the avoiding not quite diagonally can result, in contrast to the bees, up, down, or - it can be only two-dimensional, and to be sure only toward the turning point bar-ness of the tire. 
While the bees here endlessly many possibilities openly stand, in order to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to make use of at the car robot of only the rotation, or the accelerating and braking. 
The BR23C contains have lithium polymer batteries that are easier and energy more efficient, and therefore a longer service life, than a conventional lithium ion batteries. 
Andoh explained, it comes on the instinctive, intelligent reaction on, and fewer on the processing of the data, and yet fewer on the capacity to store this. 
This device must process some input per second solely and must react correspondingly to it. 
It doesn't have to store produce this, or on the basis of earlier maneuver a intuitive, logical reaction so that it uses running merely a handful of KB memory. 
It needs no gigabyte memories and megabyte of heavy memories. 
This is the first step under development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, that will be after estimation of Nissan within the next ten years standard in production. 
A further use could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation in that it directs the driver deliberately around hindrances around and leads it so at the goal. 
A name for the sÃ¼ndteure child 
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar 700-Mrd-Dollar 700-Mrd-Dollar 700-Mrd-Dollar DOLLAR of heavy rescue package law exists, that becomes to use be in several stages and aims on the purchase of the bad credit of the banks. 
In the first run, the half of the money is supposed to be issued. 
In a session, that went on Saturday after midnight local time east coast to end, the congresswomen brought themselves after multi-day debates to a unification over the rescue package heavy 700-Milliarden-Dollar 700-Milliarden-Dollar billions 700-Milliarden-Dollar DOLLAR, reported Reuters. 
"We have essential progress obtains", said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American house of representatives, and meant, had to put one the unification only on paper. 
Both presidency candidates supported the obtained compromise over the rescue package - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson meant to the result: The program will show effect and becomes it efficient, one had to do however yet more. According to Pelosi, it would not concern tearing around here the rescue of the Wall Street, but rather therefore, the oar of the economy. 
The written frame of the package became before the opening of the Asian markets, therefore, Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European Time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), publishes, released however no height flight on the stock exchanges. 
On Monday first the house of representatives will vote over the bill to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, is the senate at the row. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the white house welcomed the messages over the unification. 
We are satisfied with the progress obtained in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the white house. 
The program deviates to be sure from the original recommendation of the Bush administration according to what the 700 billions of dollar should be issued all at once for the purchase more rotten, with credit of burdened securities. 
In a first tranche, the half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages 700-Milliarden-Betrages billion 700-Milliarden-Betrages of fraud is supposed to be issued maximally whereby 250 billions are immediately available, after the congress will vote as expected on Monday over the Causa. This sum is supposed to be spent for the purchase of credit onerous, bad securities, and over the further 100 billion USD, the president should decide. 
The program is reviewed of an own commission, that also the president of the Federal reserve listened to. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the congress. 
In the sense of the law, the treasury can use also a combined tactic: It can burdened purchase simultaneously bad credit, mortgages, and with mortgages securities, or also other "poisonous" credit. 
How responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can both in an auction and direct result. 
The law enables pay it the concerned firms to participate in an insurance program, with which the treasury guarantees the serious means, and the businesses the fees corresponding to expecting damages. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defined the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an immediately aid for the American financial system, would be it for the large-scale purchase of bad means, its insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that is released by the collapse of a larger money institute. 
We set the necessary steps so that we are ready to the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The bosses of that in difficulties of advised and now on national aid directed banks can calculate to be sure therewith that its dispatches, that are named in the overseas slang careless "gold-like handshake", of which government are shortened. 
There will be an abridgment of the salaries only in certain cases, and these abridgments will depend therefrom how the treasury assists respectively. 
The abridgment meant essentially that if the ministry purchases in the frame of an auction, so that "gold-like handshake" taxed becomes, unless, the from served bank boss is pushed off into the pension. 
In the case a direct purchase of that, credit go bad aggressively will turn on itself the government in order to guarantee that the manager salaries are not exaggerated. 
To the picture is appropriate also that the existing are not changed gold-like handshake contracts - the restrictions relate only on new agreements so that the more persons participate in the program. 
That is the first case in the American story that abridgments are regulated in manager salaries per law, commented on the democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the finance committee, the measure. 
The country wins participation rights at the interested banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers, because they can take part also, as soon as it again better goes the economy and therewith also the rescued bank. 
The bill plans that the president must submit the congress in the next five years a suggestion, how the taxpayers should recover its lost money out of the finance sector again. 
There was to be sure on both sides skeptic who expressed its doubts with regard to the plan. 
That is not that, what the American citizens of us expect, the plan protects the money of the taxpayer in no case, so the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
Its colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were pushed of the same persons, who are responsible also for the collapse of the Wall Street.

Press show of the German-speaking room 
The right warehouse is became intact, only the voters within the warehouse self-confidenter - so comments on "the mirror" the weak Performance of the Christian Socialist Union in Bavaria. 
In Austria, Haider and Co are reign ready to that in order to prevent a red black coalition. 
The mirror (mirror de) 
In the online edition the to the left of established German news magazine Franz Walter analyzes extirpates the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the Christian Socialist Union in its article of "Bavaria revolution its fathers". 
In the opinion of the renowned political scientist the erosion of the Christian Socialist Union already long began before the sad Beckstein-stroke-duo received its offices. 
The Christian social renewed Bavaria over decades - now turn just the modern citizens of them off. 
The epoch breach is simultaneous a problem of the Christian democracy, like also for Angela Merkel. 
Very surprisingly the disaster of the Christian Socialist Union did not come went, but on Sunday somewhat to end, what was outlined to be sure already before rather exactly ten years: the undoubted hegemony of a state party 
For already ten years ago, 1998, the Christian Socialist Union lands in 47.7 percent and fell therewith for the first time since the fifties years under the fifty-percent-sign 
That repeated quoted itself three years ago in the Bundestag elections 2005, therefore yet in that much Stoiber era. 
The modernization consistently operated by the Christian Socialist Union in the state its own mothers and fathers extirpated in the end. 
Sociologists had predicted that already 40 years ago, considerably had misjudged at the same time however in the speed. Yet without effects, the SÃ¤kularisierung could, that development success, that do not remain demand of east and northern German into the prospering regions of Bavaria on the faithful of the Christian Socialist Union voter. 
Modernization walks always with option increase. And that has political consequences. 
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the warehouse became more critical and more self-willed. 
Is noticeable that in that last week quite the classic citizen groups expressed the largest distance to the Christian Socialist Union: the free occupations, the commercial citizenship and voter with graduation examination such as high diploma. 
Here the support of the Christian Socialist Union layered on quite under 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse. com) 
Does the conservative Viennese daily newspaper report in its "who with whom? Party chiefs reservedly in coalition questions" articles entitled over the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the reelections. 
The SPÃ would like to negotiate with the ÃVP. 
The ÃVP forbids itself the interference of the SPÃ into internal matters. 
The BZÃ appears into all directions openly for conversations while the green do not want to determine themselves with regard to a coalition yet. 
The reelections are past, and now all revolves around the coalition; in the debates in the publicly legal television, the party chiefs let look hardly into its cards. 
SPÃ boss Werner Faymann strengthened its wish to want to negotiate with the ÃVP. 
The SPÃ wants to show that a collaboration of both parties is very probably possible - in many states and in the social partnership is this already the case. 
The question whether he could imagine then a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present ÃVP boss as a vice chancellor,, let Faymann openly. 
How it said, the voters would have voted out the bowl-Molterer-course. 
A repetition of this direction would not come into question. 
Molterer carefully reacted meanwhile to red offers. 
The collaboration could not be fruitful, meant it if Faymann tries to interfere into internal concern of the ÃVP. 
Let whether its party in opposition goes, or into the coalition, be presently totally open, and these questions should ÃVP internally discussed become. 
BZÃ boss JÃ¶rg Haider appeared into all directions openly. 
"Around red blackly to prevent, are we ready, government responsibility to receive", so Haider. 
JÃ¡rÃ³ka: The devil circles of poverty and the Segregation must be broken through 
Today the European summit began in Paris to the equal opportunities, that this year by the EU advice presidency country France is aligned. 
In its speech arranged at the plenum, LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka, Fidesz delegate of the European People's Party, especially on the Bildungssegregation attentively, made because this is one of the most serious right injuries, that befalls Romany children, moreover let this be the largest hindrance for its validity need. 
The high-ranking conference became of the French employment minister and social minister Xavier Bertrand in the name of the French advice presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU commissioner for employment, social matters and equal opportunities, opens. 
Under the participants, representatives of governments, the European social partners were, as well as the most important European legal insurance organizations and citizen organizations out of the area equal opportunities. 
How the press office of the EP delegate of the Fidesz report, JÃ¡rÃ³ka made aware that next to discrimination in the job search, that Romany in first line would be displaced because of its low development level by the labor market. 
"The predominant majority of the Romany youths has no means education, and thanks to a bad primary education, only a small part of them can reach" a high diploma. 
Weiters emphasized JÃ¡rÃ³ka that development would be a basic human right, that a key roll would approach in the Geltendmachung of other human rights. 
The economy of the EUS member countries could strengthen investments into the premature education of Romany children. 
In the opinion of the delegate are it important that these connections an as wider as possible circle - therefore Romany and Romany - would not become itself aware. 
For the earlier a Romany begin student the school, to become all the more more strongly climb its chances, the productive member of the labor market; and through income tax and sales tax, they perform its contribution to the national editions. 
"As union citizens, the right must be secured the Romany on qualitatively high-value development - the bad and segregated instruction would have to be adjusted" - so LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka. 
How the delegates explained, is a joint, goal and action oriented action of the European Union necessarily in order to accelerate the Desegregationsprozess on the development sector. In addition the correct compliance of the existing and planned Anti discrimination directive is indispensable. 
"We must the devil circle out of poverty, Segregation, and unemployment break through and Romany children the democratic possibility give, to the future of Europe as fully entitled citizens to contribute", demanded JÃ¡rÃ³ka. 
Since the congress in Berlin in the past year, the summit is arranged annually with the goal, a unique forum for the Voranbringung of the goals of the equal opportunities and discrimination freedom on More european, but also more nationally plain to create in the sense of the "European year of the equal opportunities". 
Christian Socialist Union: Grace on credit 
The end of October is decided over the fate of the fallen duo strokes Beckstein 
In spite of the choice debacle, yet no heads roll were adjourned meanwhile, at the tip of the Bavarian Christian Socialist Union the personnel discussions. 
Party chief of Erwin strokes and Prime Minister Beckstein remain yet in its offices, the question is only how long preserves this grace. 
Over the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent voice loss is decided at the last October weekend in the extraordinary party convention. 
The much scolded duo let however already look through that it would not like to glue on its armchairs. 
Therewith they want to soothe the annoyed parliamentary group and the party basis, that a day consequences personal after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss the absolute majority demanded. 
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at its career highpoint - the Christian social union reached yet 60.7 percent. Now to be sure, a year after the coup against Stoiber they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the voices. 
The Christian Socialist Union was for 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, that gains 18 percent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain to be sure the decisive power in the state important southern also for the Hungarian economy, will have to reign however in the future in a coalition. 
The potential successor becomes heard bound as the first sign the party internal restructurings Hubers, vice president and federal minister of agriculture Seehofer also into the reconnaissance team, that leads with the liberal FDP, or the to the right arranged "free voters" of probe conversations over a possible citizen of Munich coalition. 
It comes an irony of the fate same that with the list "free voters" that Gabriele Pauli comes in into the legislature, whose Anti Stoiber appearance first utilized from the stroke Beckstein duo, in order to clear then the purposeful politician graceless. 
The Christian Socialist Union leadership concentrates now all its powers on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transition process, Stoiber, that until now the threads pulled out of the background, becomes, approach an active roll. The former Prime Minister and Christian Socialist Union chairperson named the 28th of September the "most bitter day of its political course". 
On Monday a couple of comments poisonous made strokes toward Christian Democratic Union - in its opinion would have earned the Christian Socialist Union far more support of the sister party. 
Other Christian Socialist Unions politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal at the Christian Democratic Union and therewith also at Angela Merkel. 
The Christian Socialist Union, that contributed 2005 also on more national plain much to the success, should not be placed can become, with a joint feat of strength again on the legs, Merkel after the Bundestag elections in September 2009 not again chancellor. 
Merkel, that made no Hehl out of its disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the grounds loss of the Christian Socialist Union will not affect negatively the large coalition in Berlin. 
What is relative to be sure: The wounded Christian Socialist Union will be, to not to reign more easily, and the crisis of the social democrats goes meanwhile further. 
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has reached its result best until now in Bavaria for 1946. 
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0 
In the choices on Sunday it created no delegate of the opposition into the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers my, this would be assumes at the prosperity and stability in the country led of Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD law adversity to be sure about the counting the voices. 
The OECD, that out of 43 countries 450 observers dispatched, did not acknowledge the choices. 
De legislature of the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates million 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates has come out to be sure for decades without opposition. Nevertheless that seriously hoped for itself the powers" (ODS) democratic under the name "united met against party before the choices of yesterday that Lukaschenko, that in the unclean choices and thanks to a constitution change 2006 its presidency mandate renewed already for the fourth time, this time some delegates of the opposition in the parliament would become "allow". 
Therefore the ODS took even distance of the boycotts planned before. 
The Ukraine becomes more and more thanks to the increasing prices in the natural gas import of Russia economically more dependent. For the relief of the price increases, even credit were received, and the country has also the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country at which Russians agreed. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the hope, the Ukraine stood wanted improve therefore its ratio with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians have because of the system classified political as antidemokratisch in the EUS entry bans. 
For a temporary relaxation provided the analysis reports of the choices of the OECD, in which the emphasis lay sooner on the positive movements, instead of on the deficiencies - like about the exclusion of one-third of the opposition candidates of the choices -. 
To be sure the campaign - accordingly might opposition in the press occur - and especially the fact did not criticize the fast reports of the OECD already on Monday that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the voices. 
In spite of all that, the opposition is able to do recognize an improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were set about at liberty, and Minsk is even to smaller confrontations with Moscow ready in that it denies further the recognition of the independence of the disloyal Georgian provinces south Ossetien and Abchasien, although Russia, with which the Ukraine forms on the paper a federal country, that has regarded both zones for a month as independent. 
"We have two steps forwards and one backwards made, but the most important is, that the dialogue between White Russia and the EU begun has", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our leaf. 
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidency choices of 2006 is a continuation desirable although "the powerful anxieties got, also to let" only an opposition into the parliament. 
The opposition plans no protest measures in view of the results, but rather to make tried sooner the necessity of an economy reform the voters clear. 
"We have here with many problems to fight - the opposition newspapers must in Russia printed become, the local authorities put us in the banish stone in the way, but nevertheless see I, that more and more person the change support, even the older" - said Milinkewitsch in allusion on that, that not once the most supported layer the Pensionisten with the Lukaschenko regime agreed is, whose single salary the manufacture social security is. 
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the climb of the trade deficit, it is begins bare a matter of time to crumble until that at the quiet security social a cemetery gemahnende""", so Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have the choices as democratic designated. 
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the partnership independent countries explained the news agency Ria Novosti: "The persons do not believe the deeds, and the words". Let the lack of the opposition be therefore a proof of the maturity of the white Russian voters. 
Brunetta: "From now is eaten breakfast" before the work 
For the first time in the story of the Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of the official. 
From today, the measure against that that Schlaumeier will step effective, that first stamp and go then during working hours Kaffeetrinken. 
The new âAnti-Faulpelz-Gesetz" became today of Renato Brunetta, that ministers introduced the presidency of the cabinet council for public administration and of Mauro Masi, secretary-general. 
">" Let revolving doors be a means to the increase of the work efficiency through a higher presence quota and more services", so minister Brunetta. 
"Now a new era of the responsibility and transparency begins. 
This is Reformismus", underlines Brunetta once again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation in all ends constructed the presidency of the cabinet council. 
Masi means to this: "The choice of the revolving doors is also large symbolic of value". 
Of sides of the official, there was no resistance, assured the secretary-general: "This process was supported of all, that came collaboration of all sides". 
There is all in everything now therefore no breakfast during working hours more; end with Kaffe or Croissant. 
Brunettas advises relating to this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock causes miracle". 
During a conference of the waiter committee of the public administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
Of Rome, the minister announced that "within three months the absences of the official decreased on 50%, that is 60,000 persons more at work per year present are". 
It adds to strengthen it would be necessary, the efficiency of the public administration of Italy 
"Its wage Dynamiken - so the minister - were in the last 8-10 years doubly as large as the private area and far over the inflation rate". 
In the meantime have cable would send gotten together itself of official in order to work against the Brunetta decree in the frame of the calling supported by Codacons. 
"During the minister for the public service with numbers over slighter Absenzen at work profiis are awake itself - so writes the consumer headquarters - the people of the 'active sluggards' uninterruptedly. 
In the deed have cable would send gotten together itself correct and valuable officials of the public service to explain the war around the illegal standards of the decree." 
Especially will be fought before the regional administration court (TAR) for additional financial balances for work contingent illness; so also the planned expansion of the obligating house arrest of the sick Arbeiternehmers while which control visits made will can and further aspects of the reform of the minister contested. 
Napolitano: "Prevention against work accidents is decisively" 
Every day happen die in Italy of 2500 work accidents, three persons and remain 27 lifelong invalid. 
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm namely that the deadly work accidents were about approximately 1200. 
These figures cover causes that seriously a phenomenon, which almost twice as many deaths as through murders emerge. 
Today that becomes painted commit (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents in order to direct so the attention of the social institutions and media on this dramatic situation. 
"The serious, of painted common data and the tragic messages of these days confirm, like decisively the question of the prevention at the job ist.", confirms the president of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in its communication at the president of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses its "large esteem for the constant engagement to the prevention at the jobs, to the protection of the injured workers, to the aid for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion". 
"An excited" Basta" raised itself hereupon; intelligibly in tragedy, that release, measured by its order of magnitude, some turbulence in the media and interest of the public. Yet the daily reality confronts even repeat can us frequently with dramatic events, that itself in its own dynamics". 
Napolitano does not conceal that "it in any case also a resource problem gives: it must decisively in development and information invested become." 
A special meaning suppose the numerous initiative for a more direct Bewusstwerdung in school frame on the part of the youth, who nourish herself the work world,. 
It is our duty to arrange the attention on this phenomenon and not to distract of its social seriously. One must set and improve a legislative standard effective. 
For its part the president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini has would form emphasized an urgent social emergency "like the phenomenon of the work contingent deaths, assist there, which insults the conscience of us all and forces all institutions in addition, on decided rules, that have the goal of setting" the problem an end. 
"The data of the work accidents seem an easy improvement to signal, this concludes however not from, that the number of the work contingent deaths much is too high", emphasized president of that painted, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We would not want that this" positive tendency means" less attention. Exactly that causes the tragedy at the end." 
"How believe that one undertakes in reason too little in order to confront the phenomenon of the accidents. One can fight through different actions on the other hand. 
Stronger inspections and inspections are according to our opinion necessary â so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to the clarification of the worker, that already in the school begin". 
"A further exertion is necessarily - so sets it thereto - what concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion. 
But above all is a larger responsibility feeling of sides of the employer vis-Ã -vis a phenomenon, the one social emergency represents, asked". 
Mercandelli came to speak on that also on "the progressive deterioration of the protection for the work accident victims" and denounced the "abolition of the social system on, against which we struggle" in the last years. 
It is "the goal consequently to return the Arbeiternehmer a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident would not become" on voluntary or accidental contributions, that are decided by time at present by a legislator, dependent. 
Mp3-Player under accusation: Danger of hearing impairments 
To hear loud music over a longer time span with portable music devices, how for example Mp3-Player,, can lead to permanent ear damages. 
This reports the European commission, which in a report common today in Brussels the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee over the current and recently identified health risks) the EU quoted. 
"Out of the report â so is named it in a comment â becomes clearly that 5-10 risk" % that, that hear loud music with portable music devices at least for five years weekly more long than an hour at the day, the durable loss of its ear. 
"I make me worries, that such a large number of youth, that usually portable music devices and mobile phone on a high volume place, its ear without it to know irretrievable damage", so Meglena Kuneva. 
"Out of the scientific conditions â so is named it on the part of the eu â a clear risk that presses to fast actions appears. 
What really counts, is it, that consumers to sensitize and these information to make to common property. 
We must review in view of these scientific insights the already existing control systems once again so that they are effective totally and with the new technology step hold". 
The independent scientific committee had delegated Brussels in view of the common utilization of the portable music devices under youth. 
"The scientist - so concludes the communication the EU - confirm, that one to quite provides is and that the eu commission jointly with the other eu members and the concerned now the necessary measures examine becomes, around children and youth better before the noise, that from portable music devices and similar device comes, protect to can". 
Already a European standard, that limits the level of the noise of portable music devices to 100 dBS, exists at the moment. The apprehension about the damages that could come out of a too large sound load. 
One can limit these damages very, in which one grasps to solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the sound exposure. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the eu refers on that that, if the users of portable music devices only five hear hours the week loud (more loudly than a 89 decibels) music, so that the legal boundaries would be already exceeded, that regarding the maximal sound level at the work place count. 
That that exceed music this boundary risk the complete loss of the ear within of five years. 
That would concern therefore 5-10% the user of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million persons in the eu. 
Romany, Alemanno gives the starting shot to the "commission for the future of the capital" 
We begin should be today, in March it past, am summed things up in June. 
That is the flow determined by the capitol for the works of the "commission for the future of the capital Rome". The commission met today morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Thermen. 
In six months, the president Marzano and the further 49 members of the commission will prepare the leadership lines for Rome. 
As soon as the project will be locked, the analyses and projects will value the city and the local council in order to be in a position in June, to be able to introduce equipped the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are in it represent", - Alemanno emphasizes. "You will present suggestions for a development plan for Rome, whose politically responsible of the city remain and the local council. 
It exists to have no redistribution of responsibility, only the will, a place, at which one can develop a large project for Rome. 
In March its task will be concluded and will break up the commission again because one such project must have a temporally certain final point. 
In June - so announced the mayor -, we will introduce the strategic plan, use become we in that the work performed by the commission". 
Who questions the competence of the commission, because its opinion would lack at obligation, that Alemanno reciprocates: "Everything depends on the work, which the commission will perform and of the quality of its suggestions,. 
If it, so like in France the Attali commission, quality full results delivers becomes â and this becomes certainly in Rome the case be â then its contribution fundamental be. 
To often, the politics with the daily problems and emergencies that appear from time to time busies itself. 
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in the view, work around so with in a deeper perspective seriously at the development of Rome and the future of the city". 
The mayor of Rome puts is much value on that to specify following "this commission neither an useless arrangement, another wreck: it is absolutely free of cost, it will cost the Roman citizens no cents and will bring us it for meditation. It will busy the best heads of the capital". 
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to possess a strategic plan, that is neither hermetical nor static to enable around our city a leap in quality - that it really compel has -, and to take" such a joint step into the future. 
A future, so the mayor of Rome, whom "itself not only in the current municipal boundaries restrict, but rather much further look becomes", not only with respect to the roll of Rome than a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but rather also as a future capital of Europe and the means sea." 
Obama â the first anti American president? Here an explanation 
A well known American politician whom much lies on that, when independent looked at to become, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti American president. 
The first was maintained Jimmy Carter, that through its decisions, the economy of the USA decimated and that with the been hostile Islam relations (and this yet today as a private man does)". 
The attacks against Obama become more and more more violent, just now that the choices approach. 
A lady out of Miami wrote in a webpage: "This person is full ambitions. 
Obama is very impudent: it thinks is received it the highest office of a nation, seen the altogether two black governors and five black senators hat!". 
Have actually these attacks not concerns answer however much to say; it racist attacks and it not the question of the voter: he will be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a large advantage. 
Also in this case, people are not there, that with the heart and with the head speak. 
A newspaper out of Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its in the Editorial: not until the choice cabin we will know well, whom the real American patriot will give its voice. 
Here a mentality of the USA comes to the light, that was held to last hidden. 
"Says, what you want, we will decide, for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain". 
People are swear there, that: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something, what one before never heard â first now that the success of the black candidate so certainly seems. 
On all cases, in spite of all these considerations, the final weapon for the democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which mistakes did Bush commit during its tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step in the rear again home. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost its life and were not forced the Americans to pack. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point of Bush for the majority. 
That that will take in its place stands before a gigantic task. 
USA. The financial breakdown leaves behind its traces also with journalists: In the newspapers, one can sense already the abridgments. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists became the future of the PEW Research center over its situation and its mental inspection concerning questioned. 
Today almost all journalists are pessimistically what concerns its future. 
Nevertheless they explained not really provides the information concerning responsible vis-Ã -vis that because of the general credibility. 
They do not feel so alone like earlier. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that was destroyed. 
Thereto the large problems come through the abridgments appropriate the Newsroom, therefore the room in which the editors work in order to assemble the newspaper. 
It does not act solved will must around a problem, that â so the interviewed journalists â if one wants to prevent, that the journalism traditional understands, how the large public it, substantially shrinks itself. 
A clear, but complicated pessimism fulfills today the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive of senior of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism would be on national levels on the incorrect way. 
In the local area are it in the Executives even at that 65%. 
Printed vs. Broadcast. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to imagine, in which direction the Web goes. 
The most important publishing groups clear themselves the way into the Internet, that is looked at by many as the "killer" of the printing press. 
That "economical pressure" that the journalists sense, climbed around up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted would bring to want to join the new technology, in the hope "it something goods for the journalism". 
The largest tear exists in the American journalism today between the editors in chief of the newsroom and the reporter, who work for it. 
56% the editors in chief on national levels are certain, its reporters divide its values with them, while it on more locally plain solely 23% are. 
Some think, it has to do with the "security in the work". 
To lose the business leaders who have anxiety, its work within three years, 47% amount to plain on more nationally. 
At the journalists, 30 are it%. 
The subject of the "certain work" in the team (our "editors", Anm d. speech). a current subject is in the USA always. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a gigantic nation how it are the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, periodicals, radio operators and TV transmitters and Internet operators, offer chooses the employers such as it them and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it. 
The editors in chief get can get very often very high wages, the editor on the other hand sometimes only 10000 Euro per month, in addition pension moneys and insurance moneys. 
What concerns the vacation, is complicated the thing: a certain quantity at days in the first year, so and so many after the third in order to reach in the end vacation days after a certain number of years 15. 
But the American journalists become how it itself admit, in the course of the year frequently "suffer". 
It is a question of the climate. 
University pole: COURT IN THE ROME: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second punishment chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, concluded to reject the proposal of the real estate agent. This had asked therefore to be transferred Rome from Grottaferrata to. 
It is determined against Coppola because of bank red in the frame of the investigation of the against agreement in the case of the acceptance of university pole Bnl.. 
In the course of the process against it during the letzen week, was transformed its release out of the house arrest into a stay duty in Grottaferrata. 
Its lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked therefore to permit the real estate agent, to be transferred of the province city into a dwelling in the capital. 
According to the court, placings (against which itself the district attorney's office expressed had) could give it such the possibility its company to influence and at it accusing evidence to arrive. 
The elite are in danger 
The phenomenon had reveals itself already some days ago when the delegate chamber agreed against the 700 billion-dollar-save package of the white house: A large part of the American was and is interested to rescue more on that to punish the Wall Street than the economy. 
This is confirmed the edition of yesterday of the New York Times that reports therefrom, how the crisis in the course step the republican party separates, that more and more splits into its old and moderate East Coast soul, who always the national institutions and the businesses community favored and that neokonservative, that "which hostily stands in opposition in Washington" and the finance world and wins v. a. in the south and the center of the countries voter. 
This part of the party owes its ascent v. a. the voice of its that I mentioned above. 
This example mentioned just now is meanwhile only a small part of the large variations, that announces or even already represents the momentary economic earthquake: not only in the USA, also in the total west and perhaps also over this out will be concerned by this. 
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which suppose shape under these new conditions finally and come at the light. 
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the shocking renaissance of the country in connection with a type Renationalisierung of the economy. 
In the deed, the crisis means a decline of the bank institutions and finance institutions, which narrow connection to foreign countries possess and administer at the same time an enormous quantity of the fortunes of private households, that live in a single country. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: namely like it vis-Ã -vis the concerned families to behave counts, which represent also a voter mass enormous. 
The crisis appears is therefore economically globally, politically on the other hand it almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems so at itself in that to one side of run to be and to have lost its speech right: The clear proof for this was given by the EU, which knows to find based on its division into different national and international conflicts no joint way. 
Therefore all reckon now with the intervention of the own country; rescue plans, new rules, and v. a. distribution of auxiliary fund: Since the crisis became more and more more serious, the USA in the situation economical is to be rescued itself solely without strange aid. 
And next to the means, they possess to use in addition also the authorization this: therefore two not to over valued prerequisites â under certain circumstances â, on which otherwise probably no international organization and no market in more similar manner will be able to fall back. 
That new stress, that is put on the nationally national element, is in the remaining in perfect harmony with the always larger meaning, that is connected most young the economy with one on the close relative sector in: the TerritorialitÃ¤t. 
It is were more paradoxical manner just now, than we yet so convinced to have entered a long time into a networked total empire, into an empire of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must assess all at once, like our future yet more and more of the essentially material things depend becomes: Water, harvest and oil. 
These can be transported to be sure certainly all by a place at that others the world, are connected however nevertheless on extreme with a closely circumscribed piece earth â a territory. 
Therefore that that controls such a territory is, one of other vis-Ã -vis, that in a harvest unproductive, waterless or of oil occurrence free zone lives, in the advantage. 
I come now to the second novelty, that prefaces however a short on push. 
Who, who government, who says politics, therewith also Leadership says to territory. 
In this sense, the finance crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand the knowledge is there around the necessity of esteemed Leaderships, therefore the need after someone, who knows, how one regulates the things. 
On the other side, a wave of the indignation exists now over the existing leaderships, v. a. that the economy which turned out to be insufficient and full shadow zones. 
Thereto a deep passing and in certain sense yet disturbing aspect comes in the end: A loss of trust, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance that is based altogether on an entire class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems to clear itself so the conviction under large parts of the population the way that it would not be first the deeds of the social elite, but rather already its idea world, its Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word,, whose salary represents come over itself the majority as always more strangely and. 
The demand after Leadership nourishes branched therefore underground one however powerful movement of the deprivation of power of the leading class and the conventional political Establishments. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voter and in the sudden reversal of the collective mind condition of the last time: beginning with the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria, over the breakdown of the Labour party in Great Britain, there to the rebellion of the American delegates against Bush (and perhaps plays also the victory of the rights in Italy here a role). 
One gets the impression, as would have the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also hers advised, periodicals, intellectual creditor, many one would say its format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding its, what goes nowadays in the lower social layers of the west before itself and yet reinforces by the finance crisis, and up to the ÃberdimensionalitÃ¤t driven becomes. 
In view of all its it simply would be exaggerated to speak about a "rebellion of the measures". 
To hold the eyes however far open it is not certain meanwhile. 
The super glue that lets rise at walls 
To overcome the powers of the gravity thanks to a glue and to be able to climb up walls like Superman. 
This is the object of four American research centers of which one now apparently almost on target arrived is. 
With a glue raised on an area by only 2.5 qcm, it is arrive the researchers to fix a 100 kg of heavy body on a vertical wall. 
The STUDIOS â an American periodical has, has the results of the researcher of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory publishes. 
The material invented by the researcher team is a further development of the already related glues, which a special carbon structure, named carbon nanotube, use. 
"The principle of the glue can one itself like a row to a pile Spaghetti of arranged tubes introduce", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have inspire let themselves of the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic HÃ¤rchen, that give the animal a perfect stop. 
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass of Teflon and bow paper showed that the new glue is ten times stronger, than the stop capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "without problem by the wall remove lets", so Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty for engineer sciences of the university of Dayton. 
AT WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? "These materials could as a transitory glue used become", sets Liming Dai thereto. 
Close upwards about around like Spiderman at walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think are sooner of a less fascinating utility, like about the connection of electric devices, for the nanotubes just as leader of warmth and electricity. 
Further use zones could fall into the area of the space flight. 
For the moment, the super heros yet must wait therefore. 
THE OTHER TYPE OF THE RESEARCH â also the university of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself a new glue type. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present clean themselves a glue out of Mikrofasern that like hairs through movement on a surface itself of the dust and preserve through it always a perfect liability. 
Never take in medicine: with fruit juice 
Caution before Grapefruit-, orange juice and apple juice. 
These drinks, which are consumed based on its refreshing quality and its vitamin wealth v. a. in the summer, can evoke serious health damage if they are taken in at the same time with certain vital medicines, because they can affect the reception of this through the body in more extremely manner. 
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, refers repeatedly to the risk more packed like also fresh fruit juices in connection with medicine receipt. In the frame of the 236th Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, it raised the again alarm: It suffices a glass of apple, orange or Grapefruitsaft in order to diminish the capacity of certain vital medicines so far that these practically are eliminated and so the health of the patients is endangerd. 
Grapefruitsaft was already under suspicion to be responsibly for that, to increase the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, heart circulation medicines, anxiolytischer and neurological means, up to toxic level. 
MEDICINES IN DANGER â the same agency of the medicine physicians and patients had warned emphasized in a report two years ago against the dangers of this Mixes, and to respect on that, what is drunk in connection with means such as about Diazepan or Metadon. 
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT â sound the expert contain also orange juice and apple juice substances which can check the medicines. 
The list of the active agent checked by the fruit juices is long. 
Therefore the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the UniversitÃ  Statale di Milano: "Such results are forwarded usually immediately at the different international manufacturers, whom it free stands so to change the consumer information. 
Therefore it recommends to read always the packing supplement and if yet vagueness exists have no Scheu a druggist or physician to ask itself", emphasized the expert of the sowed agency. 
Economy Nobel Prize goes at Paul Krugman 
The economy Nobel Prize is at the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade pattern and the settlement of economical activities. 
Krugman old the 55 years is a Neokeynesianer, that teaches at the university by Princeton, and well known for its regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic policies and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
Few months after the attacks of the 11th of September 2001, during the days of the Enron breakdown, had maintained Krugman in an editorial of the New York Times, this second event had been more decisive for the story of the USA than the attempts. 
A prediction, that did not receive little polemics as an answer and later was reproached the economist yet years, today however than totally correct proves itself. 
"I am surprises and also shocks about, like quickly the memory of the scandals in the frame of the breakdowns of Enron or Worldcom out of the public view field disappeared are", explained Krugman end 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is itself an "economist of large value", but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, that especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government richtet." 
Opuses Office, it the third version of the "Anti Microsoft" appears -package 
The day of the publication of opus Office. org 3.0 came; the opuses source software it wins as a free of cost replacement for Microsoft Office an always larger number at user, both at home and in the office, both under Freischaffenden and in the public administration. 
After a year of intensive work through the voluntary developers, who is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new opus presents itself Office now with some novelties the public: next to a revised and now more spartan formed beginning menu, is reached now finally one of reason on guaranteed compatibility with Apples operating system Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (opuses Document format) 1.2 format, therefore the newest standard ISO version, given. 
Respect against it became furthermore on the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007 whose new formats can be read (.docx,. xlsx,. pptx) by opus Office. 
Interesting also some new features are, about that that it permits to diminish the size of Powerpoint presentation, what eases for example the sending via enamel. To this also the possibility PDF files in Grafikbearbeitungsmodule counts to import and to preserve at the same time the original image of the side. 
So also "hybrid" PDF files can be generated now, which expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a word-processing system. 
The collaboration is one of the most strongly improved elements of the uses: Tables can handle more processed become now by different user by what means conflicts are avoided in variations; in the Falldes of word-processing system becomes a Frabe shown to every examiner in order to guarantee such a better correction procedure. 
Some firms are just there, to publish (on the cloud) different functions of opus Office on the Internet while in the coming weeks the definitive result is supposed to be made public. 
The Italian version is available on following left the download to: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Therefore it follows the English version that has been for Friday on the mirrors. 
Except for windows and Mac OS the program is also for the operating system Linux available. 
On inquiry, one can the installation CD home or into the office send let himself. 
The costs freedom can be meanwhile an incentive for the distribution of the program in the private households, it is also straight in the area of the business where opus Office the large throw could succeed: in the end already different arrangements of the public administration and schools to opus Office are passed over. 
Actually it is not missing opens once at a training offer, what means an optimal aid for small and middle businesses, and therefore even business outlooks. 
Opus Office consists of five principle components: Writer, the Word Texterstellungsprogram corresponding; Calc, that Tabellenprogram, which aims on a displacement of Excel; Impress, to the creation of presentation such as with Powerpoint; Dbase for operating of databases at place of the better known Access; and finally Draw, some graphics module. 
It is the objective for the year 2008 to reach 5 million downloads â a goal, that in already now reached 3 million and 600 thousands also easily exceeded will can. 
Also cabbage positively tested and therewith the fourth performance drugs case 
It a new performance drugs case mi frame of the past Tour de France opens itself: Bernhard cabbage of the team Gerolsteiner, that concerns the Austrian athlete as a Drittklassifizierter and victor of the tricot of the best climber. 
The message published the daily newspaper L' team on its web page. 
The 26-year-old cabbage of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, who positively on Cera, that was tested Epo of the third generation. Before this was true already at the Italians Riccardo RiccÃ² and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analyses out of the blood samples of cabbage belong to that, which were handled in that last week by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay Malabry. 
If the against samples confirm now the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and excluded become for two years by the races. 
The boss of the French Antidopingkommission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and also the Austrian responsibles notifies loudly the Associated press. 
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the platform and claimed furthermore also the tricot of the best climber for itself. 
SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIST? 
Italy, "the former country of the emigrants is since short one of the preferred countries for immigrants become" which are received only with going against. 
Make these a nation of racist out of the Belpaese? This asks became the New York Times in a long article, that is dedicated entirely to the subject of the racism in Italy and comes from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre sturdy out of Burkina Faso, that in Milan a month ago murdered after it had swiped a packing of cookies. 
The case witnesses of that, what designates" the Times as a "paradoxically the north: the northern regions are is" that, in which "most integration and work possibilities" exist, and to indicate nevertheless "the highest degree at anti immigrationistischen Sentiments and the largest support the Lega north. 
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episode of the intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only this. 
Also the new legislation brought in by the Lega against immigration and to the faster from direction of the illegal immigrants is cited than a sign of the climate change in Italy. 
A movement, which also the pope and the president of the state underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope in a meeting on the Quirinal for a collaboration between church and country to the fight of the racism." 
Students victim of that up to 900-Euro per room high rent prices 
The market for dwellings for studying knows no crises. 
Loudly the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenant labor union, can cost a single room a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. 
"This phenomenon supposed already very serious trains. Entire multitudes of students lose to study so in reality its right because its families are not in a position to support it in this height" âso the responsible of the Sunia, Laura Mariani â "in these cities leads the large demand on the part of the students to a Deformierung of the market, who damaged also the other inhabitants. 
Moreover most rent offers include a row of offences: free contracts, missing registration, without rent price boundary, prohibited subleases. 
For the Sunia, the necessity exists after extraordinary measures, which lead through a revision of the taxation to lower Mietpreisen. 
In more exact view of the investigation stands out that in Milan a roost in the quarter Brianza ca. 450 Euro required will begin; a single room in 650 Euro (in the quarter of volumes Nere) and ends with 800 Euro in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or quite 900 Euro in the quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence, a roost costs on the average 350/400 Euro, a room 700. 
In Bologna where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, are 250/280 Euro for a roost of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, the prices in the quarters are around the university about about 600 Euro for a single room, 450 for a roost in a double room. 
Only little the rents in the quarters are deeper around the other University of Rome: 550 Euro in Ostiense and CinecittÃ . 
Only he who into outlying districts avoids can money save: 300 Euro for a roost and 450 Euro for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar lodgings. 
In Naples, one require lies 300-450 Euro for a roost, for a room the price between 400 and 600 Euro in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari, a roost costs 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350. 
In the smallest cities, the prices are lower, but they have a larger weight in the municipal economy. 
In the cities, in which the phenomenon of the rental is more frequent at non-European students, how about in Perugia, exists even a further anomaly: a renting, that lie around 25-30% over the average, are demanded of foreign student. 
Goodbye to the old movie theater Paradiso â its historic movie theater halls close the cities 
The historic movie theaters close based on the favored Multiplexkinos. 
"A city without movie theater halls is a blind city, like a face without Augen." 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect, what happens momentarily in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces. 
The process of the exclusion of the movie theaters, that began with the birth of the large Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, means in the long run death for the on hall movie theater in the center. A process that appears not only inevitably and irrevocably, but rather also the trains of a cultural crime carries. 
Concerned are usually historic places full memories, "it is like a friend to lose, with the emotions full one a piece street traversed has", so the director the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" that brought in it 20 years ago the Oskar and the large price of Cannes. It concerns the story of a suburb movie theater and its nostalgia, which exists from that to live in one probably for always lost movie theater worlds. 
The numbers, which the Anec, that central business association delivers, speak one clearly language: in the last five years had to close paid the enormous quantity of 316 traditional movie theater; this mine to a large degree the movie theaters in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To the most strongly concerned regions, the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost movie theater belong, followed of the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41. 
This witnesses therefrom that the head indebted are the Multiplexkinos, for are straight these three regions, in which the largest number of these modern movie theaters was registered: with 195 in the last 5 years leads the Lombardei the lists on, it are 81 both in the Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna. 
"The business has itself in an irrational manner developed", so Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is to be sure usefully that also new structures arise, but at first place stands the receipt of the already existing, for closes a hall in the city, are not all its patrons ready to search for in place of the old a Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here yet the missing budget respect remains external for the foundation the business association: the indebtedness indicated by the country amounts to ca. 10 million Euro. 
It is a shame of the ethically moral standpoint that the government does not note the existing laws. 
In order to received the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million Euro in the year of needs". 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which concluded based on the anxieties around the old movie theater halls, is, to protect this through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it concerns the first agreement of this type in Italy, that aims on that to protect and to support the traditional movie theaters, and this both in the historic center and in the periphery. 
Under the anticipated measures, also fiscal before divisions are for the movie theater operators as well as advantages for the public regarding the local traffic: it will be permitted, to go into the verkehrslimitierten areas of the center and to park moreover to more favorable parking fee. 
"It is a pleasant initiative", so Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join to our example and sketch in addition also yet new drafts. 
Certainly however we require also a better Audio- and video equipment in order to be able to align against the superpower of the MultiplexsÃ¤le something, for in the end the public of today is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional movie theater was for me always an important subject: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, that place of my childhood and youth to establish, was the decisive point, that brought me in addition the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", also if I had played already for 10 years with the thought. 
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in that via Nazionale, there where I experienced so many different emotions, turn I me to the side in order to not to have to see the dust overcast placards. 
The connections between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready, the decisions of the community the interests of the mafia group Piromalli on suitable.. 
The accusations of the bar of the Antimafia authority Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and its representative pink Rio Schiavone of the community Gioia Tauro, that were arrested today morning because of complication into mafia businesses, are serious. 
In handcuff taken became also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as its nephew: the lawyer, who carries the same name such as the boss the clan, was already because of complication into criminal unions the mafia convicts become, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million Euro. 
"Each type of moral and juristic standard neglecting", write the lawyers, "had both local administrations concluded, the lawyer Piromalli moneys for advisory activities to pay." 
"Therefore was it the mafia group possible made become â so the judges â on official way into the city halls to penetrate and the politics of the public administration with certain." 
The president of the regional committee Kalabriens Agazio Loiero does not deny that it in its region "all other as an exception is, on connections of local administrations and the organized crime to knock." "There are is larger places, in which the concentration of the mafia than in other, in which such connections are practically unavoidable. 
But there is also local politician, who resist the pressure of that 'Ndrangheta: Heros, that a white vest survive." 
The arrests of today morning follow that of the past July, with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April the local council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but already 1991 â and also at that time based on alleged connections between organized crime and the local administration â had been relieved the local politicians of its local authorities. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, at that time mayor of the Udc, was selected after the sting choice from May 2006 to the head of the middle right coalition. 
It screamed arranged scandal as the prefecture the solution of the local council. 
He sued on that into the vice Secretary of the Interior Marco Minniti, whom he accused to have invented all for politically strategic reasons. The judges however explain morning in connection with the warrant of today that the Piromalli clan even had ventured it to apply for a change of the A3-Projektes. 
Out of a monitor action in connection with the investigations to the case Dal Torrione, appeared is the readiness to meet the wishing of an entrepreneur, that of course a representative of the large group around the Piromalli âby what means the measures of the public administration identical with the interests of this clan wurden." 
If the energy springs out of the waves, the large run suddenly up 
It is not one versiegende money source, which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet, and first now the large energy firms of the world seem to grasp this. 
Waves, currents and tide are look seek the new renewable energy sources at that now everyone, and to occupy also, about giant such as Chevron. 
The possibility to win energy out of the movements of the sea, is taken already for 70 years into consideration and examines intensified itself; not accidentally these studies since the first earth oil crisis considerably. 
As the price of the oil around 1980, vergas broke on press one the idea of the sea energy, now however the environment organizations and the increased oil price on new impulses in this sector. 
The world Energy Council (WEC) in London appreciates that 15% of the worldwide energy demand could be covered by the energies produced by the ocean waves. 
This would come the double of the energy produced momentarily by nuclear power plants same. 
Thereto yet the currents and tide would come moreover. 
Giant in the attack. 
The first firm, that sets now on the sea energy, is Enersis, that has signs in 2005 a contract to the erection of a power plant in the north of Portugal. 
As this message published became seemed to concern it a revolutionary step. 
Two years more and more firms are later it now out of the traditional energy industry, that set on the navy energy winning. 
"Chevron examined these technologies" â so the speaker of a business well known the US American giant in the Wall Street Journal â and ventures assist together the possibility from with us." 
It concerns herewith the procurement of an allowance of the American energy commission, that is necessary in order to start a project before the coast Alaskas. 
This is not a sign to be underestimated, v. a. if one considers, that just in Alaska further oil is promoted by the USA and President Bush started recently first the plans for new borings. 
Next to Chevron, also the firms are earned Power inc. from New York and Ocean Power out of New Jersey, that invest into the new industry; also the details are not well known, speak observer yet about an increasing interest. 
Yet improvement worthy technologies. 
Experts do not speak about a technology finding itself yet in the departure, this finally because yet the last doubts by sides of the conservationist are not clarified. 
Previously projects such as that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension are and seem to cause no seriously to be taken ecological problems. 
In order to produce however energy in large standard, it needs technologies with far larger influence on the environment. 
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power about uses a system of buoy connected together. 
The push of the waves, which low moves the buoy up and, is transformed within the swimmer over piston and cylinder into hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine, which operates again a generator. 
The current is sent on that over lower water pipes to the coast. 
Until now, there is four planned plant of this type which wait only for the national permission. A part of the won energy could serve also for military arrangements. 
Power earned produces meanwhile already energy for an its department store and a Parklatz with the help of unterseeischer turbine in the East River of New York. 
The turbine drives the water movements during the tide, which feeds the generator through the emerging rotation. 
Loudly earned waits already a long snake of possible client to use on the necessary authorizations around these energy sources. 
First the waves, then the tide. 
A special interest earns according to the institute for current winning research immediately the potential which sticks in the tides. 
Although it concerns also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are yet better prediction cash as a wind currents, the sun irradiation and also the waves, and therefore a trustworthyer power source. 
Straight the tide energy is it, which states brought such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as further coast countries in addition, to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 â for 2009 are planned already up to 35 million.
