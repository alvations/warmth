Lack of snow in the mountains quält the hoteliers
Scneelose pistes make Sorgenn the Riesengebirgen inhabitants.
The missing snow shrink from the people of order ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, you can get still vacancies in giant mountains for all winter dates incl. Christmas and new year.

People go through the offers, prices determined, but now they are afraid of binding order.
And when they call us, ask immediately, whether we believe the this year's Christmas snow or "mud" will be the information portal operator led Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want the new year stay in the spindle mill exactly to its liking, should no longer hesitate to purchase.
Who prefers the savings and the quality of the stay only in second place comes, which can try, wait a few days.
The spindle mill hoteliers now offer mainly only week stays for the new year's eve day.
I think that they still for a while, trying to sell them but they must also give, and comment on faster.
And then be quickly have the free rooms, estimated Jandura.
Always always also travel ingtours in Vrchlabí offers free beds at all winter dates.
Now most Christmas week, which is not sold in the meantime we are interested in.
About half of the courses is still free in our offer.
Therefore we have prepared some lower-cost Christmas stays at the last moment, led the Director of Agency of ingtours, Petr Schiefert to.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer new year's eve day in giant mountains but here there are less free places.
The first fortnight have good sold in February the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This negatively influenced that there is always no snow in giant mountains is interest winter stay this year.
People wait snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
The slopes within one week of should be snowed the Christmas will be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, the rooms at the hotel succeed occupy Pecpod Snezkou horizon.
We are approximately five percent better than in the previous year.
Day new year's Eve and Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is interest in Polish holiday in the Ianua and in February the business will run well, informed the Director of the best hotels in Pec, Karel Rada.

The giant mountains hoteliers now wait for more snow Bescherung.
On Thursday it should cool off and if rainfall, which should be snow in the mountains.
But then will again be a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of Czech Wetteramtes in Hradec Králové.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical with which students Strebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation the smartest repeated his predecessor in the question of Afghanistan strategy, which he considered themselves the Dümmsten.
When he finally ausschwitzte his highly anticipated Afghanistan doctrine has shown that he abschrieb it three years about copying paper from the Bush Iraq scenario before.
Not only that he even several times used the saying in the text "Iraq" as he is even named of the Bush-Declaration of January 2007 the name of its own declaration: "New way forward" used without zaudern to.
This, he has criticized the Bush idea - send fresh commit to Iraq troubled by civil war - three years ago as "irresponsible and trophische karas in their conclusions decision".
Subsequent months showed, that Bush strategy of recommendations of the military only possible and to the extent that was very successful, that we no longer speak the news about Iraq.
This reputation Bush was not improved, because objectively he has a much dankbarere situation his successor rear left, as it was to be expected.
In the Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle repeats.
To increase the contribute forces to the military it asked again, especially the upper Commander of General Stanley McCristal, which hard criticised in the White House zaudernden protecting even despite Subordination habits of the operation of of Afghanistan.
He called 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The President hesitated for three months, is but not better idea has come and so he has wenistens betrayed the General to 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed more 5,000 commitment even if it was itself originally at least with 10,000.
His project in 18 months withdraw the troops from Afghanistan and complete this process within a three year period is highly problematic to the whole Obama strategy. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt the marshland increase will bring the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Despite the years Bruderkrieg Iraq society is relatively well structured, their leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - you can rely on anyone and not be kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to change their mind every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally properly founded remain only fake buildings behind which the patriarchal master relationships are continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated especially due to the complexity of relationships which further complicate the Pakistan-and Iran influences.
Building a "authorized State", which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Befremdet horizon of Obama strategy through its voluntarism
Over the past eight years the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated only further, now located on the edge of the explosion.
Believe the small soldiers who are broken out in the Kriegsgeschrei about the "early repatriation", here create a miracle can only a really romantic soul of facts not impress which itself can be.
From a political perspective, the withdrawal date setting is pure irresponsibility because the Taliban will accept as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO Summit showed the willingness of Europeans to participate the battles in Afghanistan is running.
Europe's politicians can and want to their voters not also explain how the security related Germany or Italy war in the Hindu Kush mountain region.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased penalties do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question whether it was to resolve the problem with troops result for the United States.
This question must be answered in the period America continues after Obama to the winning penalty from Afghanistan.
Any solution will involve also a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only Barack Obama Trostpflaster is that three years remain until the presidential elections, and thus remains enough time so that he can access to a different strategy, fallls dead would prove them.
The Manager of the bank Goldman Sachs more cash received no premium bonuses
The senior executives of American Bank Goldman Sachs receive no premium bonuses this year more in cash.
The announced the company thus responds to the sharp criticism of their pay practices.
A group of 30 best business receives shares you may sell only in five years instead of money.
In addition the shares can be withdrawn the managers in the case if excessively risky Act.
Goldman Sachs does so in accordance with the Agency of Reuters at the forefront of efforts to combine premium bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which it has to go the former banker of company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led to.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs had become the target of criticism after she had put aside nearly $ 17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The overall height of premium bonuses during this Jahra will exceed $ 20 billion agency of Reuters probably despite today displayed action.

Minister Janota is considering the withdrawal. Klaus invited him in the Castle
President Václav Klaus receives early on Friday the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which considering because he was released with the execution of the State budget for next year in the form like this by members meeting on Wednesday about his stay in the Government does not agree.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps retention Janota in the be topics of Friday meeting.
The budget is criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high what further deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the meeting President speaker informed Radim Ochvat.
His further stay in his role Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the premier Jan Fischer.
The Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion crowns should operate according to the budget law now receives Klaus signed.
In Parliament but on Wednesday the left party proposals for monetary upheaval tuned and raised money for the Staatsbeamte wages for the support of social services and direct wages of farmers.
Invoked the Government has the proposals of the Social Democrats against, hidden increase the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the Government Klaus and Rechtspartei on the other hand, so a sharp domestic dispute arose, raises the question about the further work of fishermen staff Cabinet are, on their design the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget to, as it was adopted by Parliament, the austerity package virtually liquidated, which on the part of the Fischer-Government in autumn enforced and that believe their public debt stop to.
Klaus which can sign the law on the State budget, but must not declared today at discussion breakfast with the contractors, that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which represents "the untenable deficit" of public finances, long time.
According to him there is today no good solution more.
An improvement could bring a strong Government could build plus on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek TOPOLANEK, led on the budget is grauenvoll and the Government should consider more existence.
The ODS Authority Chairman Petr NECAS, said the CTK concept of official Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Greens Party obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as "strong sentences".
CSSD boss, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolánek words that the budget deficit was grauenvoll earlier this year Topolánek Government had prepared and which exceeds 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the CSSD through the approval of the State budget for next year a success.

Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in the new film by Clint Eastwood
The South African claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene" the world much of the country shows the fight and WINS despite some critiques the lead was occupied by an American actor.
The story of sport, race conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman is in his life the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in the South African Republic, as well as its first Black President Nelson Mandela.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela whether it could be him film in the Eastwood-.
A more significant role Matt Damon.
I told him: "If I will play, I must make."
Zweiundsiebzigjährige actors of the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the Inbox pane "million dollar baby" receive had, already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery represented, from the end to the Sklavenhalter has become, a fictitious USA President is and God in "Evan Almighty" rarely someone, who is still alive and as Mandela is so important for many people.
The former SüdafrikanischeStaatsmann was for his active role at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic 27 years in prison.
He was undfür in 1990 released set four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen" and at the same time this is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The request was to speak as he
The film describes a real event of Nelson Mandela join forces with Captain of South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to reach it. The new President Mandela knows that his people remains still Vorota terms and economically divided by apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sport therefore, rugby player, world belonging to the outsiders, to decide.
Finally, the South African team increases on to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years that bring the Mandela story on the screen.
He had no other goal than this role to play as closely as possible to bring this reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was granted to speak as he.
The actor said if he and world politics in the same country would be, he would try to meet with Mandela to eat dinner with him and to be before his speech behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake hands Mandela.
I noticed when I schüttele the hand, I take your energy is transferred and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to be become someone else.
Matt Damon in the Francois Pienaar, Captain of the national rugby team represents the white players have outweighed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him as he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, opened and was the first thing I said in my life to Francois Pienaar: 'In the film I see from much larger'.
Despite the obvious differences in stature of the actor compared with their actual role models, he has headed by Director Eastwood "Invictus: unbeaten" received positive reviews and we talk about prospects for an Oscar.
Film critic of leaf daily variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized its evaluation in the following words: "It was very good story, very well executed film."

Resolved light mystery about Norway: the Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was about Norway.
The Russian Ministry of defence has admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile tested near the Norwegian border.
The start was not successful but again and the missile designated as type "Bulava" which should initially be the pride of the Russian army is slowly Putin, nightmare Russian Generalitat and the premier Vladimir.
His repeated presence at the missile test site had no positive impact on the success of the Probeflüge.
Bulava is usually not even start or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspaper to write about "Bulava" as on a "rocket, which does not fly".
A missile which does not fly but light
This already 13. Try proceeded normally at the top.
Only at the end of the flight occurred in turn technical damage to the missile.
Probably the third Raketenstufe engine exploded.
This time, "Bulava" started from nuclear Dmitrij Donskij, which went underwater the White Sea.
This missile type enables the shooting from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that mysterious light caused by an undefined flying object over northern routes actually was damaged "Bulava".
Also, the Norwegians have doubted since the first moment not is a Russian missile.
The Generalitat diesesmal against kept and claims one can talk not clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile not fell off and the third stage was affected only by the accident.
The previous cases equal damaged engines in the first stage.
If no test start without errors, then the management of the Ministry of defence of only six of thirteen for unsuccessful holds.
Almost fifty % success therefore meets the Generalitat with optimism and so is that "Bulava" even without problems will fly and bear even ten top sound Atomsprengköpfe with a total mass of Max 1.15 tonnes claims continue.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with 51 years with CSKA Moscow

Fetisov has completed his career with forty years in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further Defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that it will support the team.
We need only to clarify some remaining formalities agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club by Sergej Nemcinov.

Hyundai was to trade unions. All overtime lifted
The Nosovice Hyundai car factory management agreed with the Union on the abolition of all overtime.
Because often arranged overtime, the Union has announced the willingness to strike on Monday.
The confirmed speakers of Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
Management wants to but agree with trade unionists over a layer of Saturday this week.
We must not abandon our production schedule, which is a principle, therefore was on Saturday, 19. December, voluntary overtime because of the proposed that two Arbeitsschichten would be worked Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company has offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the staff which the Saturday layer would work.
Employees get also retrospectively for the Saturday layer of 28. November.
Vanek, the company has decided to change the proposed overtime staff motivation type.
Either pay the overtime payment or can substitute holiday for the 28. Vanek led to take December and extend to the Christmas holidays.
In addition, Fahrgeld and lunch to pay everyone of Saturday layer.
Due to the fact that the overtime were the most urgent and brennendste point with regard to claims and complaints of trade unionists last week set production, the management decided yesterday afternoon December with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month, led to Vaněk.
Car factory employees had been forced until last week, eight hours layer to work almost every day 2 overtime.
The strike readiness on the part of trade unions is revoked from the agreement.
Frequency, negotiations between car factory management and trade unionists will be forthcoming on Friday afternoon.
Union leaders, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they agree to meet the demands and can sign a joint document, they are ready, remove strike call.
The situation in the car factory has acuminate to last week, on Wednesday, as went on approximately 400 employees spontaneously strike due to constant overtime.
You were protesting against the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management was opposed that employees must make the overtime to meet the automobile supply needs.
The unionists demanded in ihremMontags strike readiness exclamation also, occupies the who had interrupted production last Wednesday with no penalties.
In the overtime, the trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition they are demanding the fee of 5000 CZK this year paid.

Czech detection: a substance ´ gestählten in ´ does HIV viruses
The team from Czech and German scientists tests new connections that you want to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that he works for the viruses which are resistant against drugs.
This fact will prevail against the disadvantage that the connection to strongly affects common virus variants, as one of the already existing medicinal products.
Yet you can not cured the disease of AIDS.
Patients can extend the drug mix but life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
Your revenue is but accompanied by a variety of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus propagation is also the development of sg. Resistant viruses cause against which no medicines are more effective.
The work of experts three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (University of chemical technology) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way how you can deal with the virus resistance.
You have shown that substances called Metalokarborane work on the Eiweißstoff is responsible for propagation of HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These connections block virus propagation differently than all medicinal products used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists to new ´ get improved ´ connections that have been prepared based on knowledge of their bond on the virus Eiweißstoff molecular mechanism.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three dimensional structure: two much tray-cages which consist of Bor-, hydrogen and carbon atoms and cobalt, are linked by a metal atom in this case.
Heimtückisches and persistent virus
HIV protease is Eiweißstoff of the HIV virus of that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
No mature infection virus particle would emerge without HIV virus Division caused by the HIV protease.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we turn off the multiplication of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the scientists in the press release which was published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of CR.
In working Journal of medicinal chemistry was published in science magazine, the scientists describe whole series of connections where two pairs of cages (see table) by a short organic chain are coupled, then systematically further changed.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of this number of substances against HIV protease wurdne tested in the test tube against their persistent (resistant) variants derived from HIV infected patients.
The effects of Metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as the clinically used drugs, but she lose their impact on the resistant variants used medicines are often ineffective against.
The unique mechanism and their other properties, further biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and ability chemical configurations makes the Metalokarboranen interesting links for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of Institute of organic chemistry and Biochemistry and of the Institute for molecular genetics of Academy of Sciences.
Dispute due to budget. ODS was los to fishermen, which is
Chairman of ODS, Mirek TOPOLANEK, called "grauenvoll" to the approved budget for next year and the Government of Premier by Jan Fischer believes should be given more existence.
The Prime Minister called "strong sentences" statement of ODS.
It is time for analysis of alleged.
The Deputy Chairman of ODS, Petr NECAS, said the concept of official Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Greens Party obviously no longer works.
After NECAS, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to support if the fight against the growing deficit, minority in Parliament or whether it's him his stay in the Office using the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and the Social Democrats of the problems of public deficits is diametrically opposed notwithstanding, NECAS has pointed.
Parliament has adopted the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, however, link party amendments through more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has increased money for Staatsbeamte wages, the maintenance of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government has invoked against the proposals of social democracy in hidden increase the budget deficit.
Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, it is complied with the request of the Government, because the modified budget is only a less bad version of budget provisoriums. Frase not clear
Disappointment and jest
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his frustration and a sense of futility whereas Premier Jan Fischer has mentioned that the Government has assessed the current situation.
NECAS is convinced that, if Janota seriously had threatened with his resignation in the event that would accept the Abänderungsvorschläge the situation would look different.
In accordance with Czech Television Monday after the Government business with the premier Janota signed.
While he has indicated that he considered his further stay in the Office.
This is his disappointment about the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent are fishermen favour the further struggle with the budget deficit, thus Nominanten of the Social Democrats (CSSD) had enforced the changes in the budget to do nothing in the Government have in accordance with NECAS.
The premier should also say that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue deficit steigernde laws such that sick pay and pensions or service Gesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: The Minister nominated by ODS not irrten is
It is matter of Premiers fishermen and the whole Government.
Make no mistake, Topolánek pointed out a text message from the United States Minister nominated by the ODS.
It has noted that in some ministries in Deputy function people sit, committed 09 to TOP, which voted against the budget.
NECAS stressed that, if Fischer darür decides, to abandon, the fight against fiscal deficit level it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the link which is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly not can count on the support and tolerance of civic Democrats.
I have not thought about, and if it will be up to date, then I will deal so that the said citizen Democrats Defence Minister Martin Bartak nominated the journalists in the Parliament.
Premier fishermen afternoon flew on the European Council meeting to Brussels.
The ODS resigned at the request of Premiers
NECAS stressed at the same time the ODS probably would vote on Wednesday in Parliament against the modified budget if the Premier members of the European Democrats would ask expressly allow the adoption of the budget.
We come before us as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiation of the budget was not pushed back by absence of leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I do not realize that my vote would lack.
As I on the mandate, resigned, I knew it would go in coming months to Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction all positive, reacted Topolánek itself.

The largest changes the introduction of new direct verkehrsweges from Milovice belongs to Prague, currently must change inhabitants of Milovice in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth Verkehrsweg of suburban system Esko, whose opening thanks railway electrification of Lysá nad Labem is possible after Milovice.
The remote langstrecken in the capital are end station in Prague - destination station.
The CD introduces more fibers SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and drive trains to Sumperk Jeseník in the two hours.
The Pendolino allows since 13 passengers. December no longer travel to Bratislava.
This year's invoice for regional railway: increase to 200 million
The trains are appointed and paid by the Department of transportation, total railway to the disappearance of so-called liquidity loss is exact as this year four billion kronor in the next year. The Lokalzüge provide the districts, overall they pay eight billion kronor, where the State zuschießt three billion next year.
Regional trains are expensive CZK 200 million this year.
For the Lokalzüge and the trains the railway completes new a ten-year contract, contract only for one year was signed until now.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has fingered also therefore to price increase for the vast majority of the tickets.
Changes occurs only in one-day power fahrscheinen CD NET and affordable Internet fahrscheinen eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card which will increase price CD NET CZK 450 to 600 CZK.

Great expectations is the movie because it comes at a time in the cinemas in the preparations for the World Cup kulminieren in South Africa on the one hand, while the media shake the world with awesome news about increasing racial hatred and discrimination against people from the black ruling majority.
According to AP News Agency, the reactions to the new movie in South Africa are being consistently positive despite numerous reservations against occupation leading with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film to his own words.
From this role, I have many years gerträumt and have it well prepared me.
Several times I Nelson Mandela met personally, I - as they say - to receive its energy he led on the interview after the Festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.

Jancura collects criminal complaint for defamation against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of collecting student agency, Radim Jancura today criminal complaint for defamation against three social democratic leaders.
Michal Hasek from the district South Moravia, Radko Martinek from District Pardubice and the head of the District of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen interview in the radio journal.
The action is related to the effort of the company to operate the regional train in some districts.
All regions but ultimately signed long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three conductors attack us and say that we remove the raisins, while we have made the offer on the extent as it was aligned with them.
You say that we expensive Czech are railways than because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway completed last week.
So no choice other us defend us.
For this defamation society student agency, Jancura said the radio journal.
At the same time, he led to have evidence from all districts, they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
Therefore we prepare a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek deems more continuation of media show of Jancura survey of the criminal complaint, is it as free advertising for his company and his own person.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and reputation my district and this I urge other head.
I assume that in this matter will clear, that it is Jancura manipulated public opinion in the case of regional one rail transport and used lügenhafte and untrue arguments Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he have invested several million crowns will draw attention to the detrimental step of the districts in advertising.
He said the radio journal it intercepts the campaign after Christmas and they will continue after new year.
He specify that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the areas on the initiative of regional eisenbahnverkehrs with the Czech Railways agreed and no tenders had tendered for the order from a high to 150 billion kronor.
After Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and in contradiction with the requirements of justice.
Due to criticism of the railways in the districts a member of the CSSD threatened him, according to Jancura, already.
The only threat was if we do not refrain to lose even the bus licenses.
He does not himself as a member of the CSSD before, I know who it is, say his name I Jancura said the radio Journal today.
Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae free and voluntary
Imfung against Streptococcus pneumoniae changes the usual January.
To be first for families free and voluntary.
But now report voices that compulsory vaccination would be effective.
Kulminieren preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The pharmaceutical Institute already set the maximum price of vaccines that have to pay for health insurance.
The experts are of the vaccination process in mind.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January children can be vaccinated free of charge against Streptococcus pneumoniae, to 2. August last year and later were born.
The condition st have received no vaccination dose.
Who last year or earlier has begun with the vaccination must pay even weitereWiederholungsimpfung.
The first vaccination dose should be between 3. and 5. Given its month of the child.
Already last year one quarter of the families had vaccinate their children against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
The youngest children vaccination requires four doses.
As a whole, experts estimate that health insurance for vaccination doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 SEK per year.
But save for treating children without vaccination would need.
Until now, State for all surface vaccination of children has issued approximately 500,000 per year.
Compulsory vaccination was introduced with the sogenanntem Janota package.
Streptococcus pneumoniae cause Mittelohrentzündung but also serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and Blutvergiftung.
Pneumokokkus infections children aged up to 28 kills us after investigation in hospitals each year up to 10 years.
Compulsory vaccination of children against Streptococcus pneumoniae in about 40 countries introduced outside the Czech Republic.
Will vaccination be duty?
At the same time said this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
January will be paid and voluntary of the insurance.
That compulsory vaccination would be better, the head of the Civic Association of Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky mentioned for example.
His association promoting already long-term Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination.
The experts at the International Conference in which our Association participated were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that it succeeded, enforce this at least.
I believe that this is the way we now need to go Kalovsky led to.
The Ministry of health will not change but the vaccination process against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
At this moment we do not consider this at all said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Chairman of practical Kinderärzten Hana Cabrnochova, professional society is to a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about reducing the number of retry impfung "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that started this vaccination as a voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect vaccinate their infants against Streptococcus pneumoniae from next year can more than 80 percent of parents.
Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae is also speaking that it is paid by the health insurance as first surface vaccination and not by the State.
The insurance should spend the money on prevention, to save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors must buy the vaccines.
This concerns the practical paediatricians is connected but that involves the purchase of vaccines.
After the original project should the vaccines purchased through the insurance companies and doctors then receive them in the same way, like other vaccines issued by the State.
Some members feared, that the insurance to "Could the money from the health insurance out perform".
Therefore doctors buy the vaccines and wait must, until the insurance companies pay them them.
According to the individual practical doctors per month to need to invest 40,000 crowns which is a significant sum.
It is not easy, Cabrnochova says.
Still they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular State.
In a time when voted Swiss voters for prohibiting construction of Minarette and widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, sound and considered report wrote about Muslims can - integrated in one of the declared säkularisiertesten companies in Europe and integrates.
Some readers are this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French love no Kopftücher" (original title: "why the French Don ' t like Headscarves") (2006) read, an elegant and densely argumentierenden a problem which employed over one and a half decades told the country and still perceive their effects are.
Bowens latest book offers a range of broader and kühneres.
As good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France say but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer "Islamic freedom" 5 to 6 million Muslims in France as it calls Bowen.
It is a good listener, he plays debates between teachers and students about the issues that most concern.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a Town Hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it allowed to use interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage for a Muslim?
It is this seemingly profane matters he comprising daily life, in contrast to the political dramas which employ the media claims.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imamen, teachers, and intellectuals, of a name, famous Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholars born in Switzerland and academics none may except Tarik.
This new generation tries to open the debate as it is possible to be both a good Muslim and on the other hand a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You have not all arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious to the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists who inquired Bowen are usually divided - with their Salafi counterparts supporters of purist Sunni Islam is with Saudi Arabia associated - today showing a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He question is to what extent French policy makers (and the intellectual elite, the passionate guarded the separation of Church and State) really feel obliged the pluralism.
He indicates that Muslims may treatment a rauere as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make its historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
It detects "Tightening the screws of value" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not".

The message of the arrest was reported by the New York Times first Freitagnacht.
The new US policy attaches importance to the United States will provide compensation if the Cuban Government is taking concrete steps in this direction as release political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and prestigious products in a country where the average earnings of government employees is $ 15 per month.
The Cuban Government only allows a mobile phone purchase normal citizens since this year, they are used skin sächlich for sending text messages because a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government agencies, universities.

Pakistani authorities discovered an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy, which aimed, to send five men from Northern Virginia to kill US soldiers to Afghanistan on Saturday and said that they hope that this case could help uncovering an extensive network of terrorist to party to search the Internet for radikalisierten young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, men had invited to Pakistan after he had learned it, because one of them had delivered favourable comments about terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah was the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and attempted, to help them achieve the remote area in Pakistan root belt Qaeda and his terrorist training camps is home to al.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence, informed about the matter said Saturday Saifullah could convince the Al Qaeda leader not that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the Northwest, which have become a terrorist Zufluchtsstätte.
You were considered as part of a covert operation.
They were therefore rejected the Government, which wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter said.
The Government said that the men were not discouraged and still tried to obtain the correct recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps as they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - still in Pakistan are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of party in identifying future terrorists and may be more important in deciding who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11. September 2001 the US secret service has made it a matter of highest urgency, placing human assets within of Al Qaeda.
The Organization of party Act Pfoertner which let in those not seriously its commitment to the holy war enough and that could be the spies.
American would-be recruits undergo A Qaeda of special scrutiny, analysts said.
Due to their potential access to US destinations and their propaganda value they are also considered enormously attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, ranghöchster analyst of NEFA Foundation based in the United States said that terrorist groups had become much vorsichtiger allow access to whom in recent years in view of the fact, because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try placing someone in these groups, what better way could go there as follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed the?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate "Action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here Saturday through the streets and demanded kühneres your business on the climate of the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre of the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates rather of approximately 25,000 originated.
The event was relatively peacefully while a handful of masked activists zündete small devices nearby some government buildings in the city.
On a day when supported by the UN climate negotiations little happened hiked thousands activists with banners by the city, where in English was "there is no planet B"and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says" enough".
Some stars protest joined, for example the Danish model photographer of Helena Christensen said that the visits her aware to Peru, the native country of her mother herzzerreißenden problems the country due to the already significant impacts of climate change faced by.
This is part of the reasons why I am, chose participate in large demonstration - weiterzureichen the word and to call on world leaders, to bring a fair, ambitious and binding agreement she said.
It is not an easy task, but must now be done and there is no way more, which is herumführt.
The police held the demonstrators, too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people mainly due to the fact that they were masked or mitführten knife.
These actions in demonstrations prohibited according to Danish law.
According to a viewer would be called not because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing ignited multiple devices of Copenhagen main channel close several ministries are located nearby.
He said they threw them into nearby buildings, and added that began as Leuchtraketen but were followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, the people on the television screens gathered for the track the demonstration the whole afternoon.
But the protest has awareness of main functionaries as Su how China's Chief climate Unterhändler, apparently not reached.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a constructive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something which I was not aware".
He then continued in Mandarin and said: "Because the venue is large, I can not hear what happens out there".
He found it depend from the perspective of the individual the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can say, disturbing the negotiations or the freedom of others".
Check data show persistent racial gap
Certificates mathematics performance were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although Washington District still far behind the schools of the country is, produce the excellence certificates that viert-and Achtklässler past made two years faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York, in the show.
But in the latest figures of the national assessment of educational progress (national assessment of educational progress - NAEP) included, is the persistent performance gap between Afro-American and white students, both local and national level.
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which their ascendency peers but only rose three points of 209 to 212.
The performance gap increased in fact between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
Progress of Afro-American Achtklässler remained the same speaking in fact, he fell a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, because the sample size not large enough.
The image over a six year period across is also encouraging.
The gap that white and separated black Viertklässler 2003 as the first NAEP was registered in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that have reached children of both groups has grown in this time, the difference with now 58 points has decreased hardly.
Some education advocates of the municipalities expressed their concern results that celebrated school Kanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were driven largely by white students who are already powerful children last week.
This indicates that we have increased overall by the treatment of those at the top of the scale, what is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. voice, a non-profit group that occurs for educational equality in Washington d.c..
I jump on a range of two or three points and nieder, the democratic Washington City Councillor said Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton elementary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of check point numbers is the secondary schools of the city need urgent attention.
Of course you would like to see the positive signs, I respect.
What but fear me, is that we not nearly spend time and energy, we should use for our school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of weak students.
This autumn for example some teachers to be old trained, a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-read system, to use, aimed at students in the upper elementary and middle school which basic skills of reading have mastered at the beginning of their school career and which significantly behind their suitable classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum which approaches games and life experience in the foreground from kindergarten to sixth class, see the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey was brought to Washington and some of the NAEP progress last week reported attributed this curriculum.
I believe that we must, work continues to leave, the students felt the best measures which are below the note level Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee it can continue to improve overall system performance and while remaining can provide additional money and resources to the inefficient schools, which are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, Professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, said examines urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms, located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C. schools.
The objective could cause political after-effects which work against this important item.
The weak point is of course as with other urban school inspectors that she tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we establish a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families regardless of where they live, certainly can be, that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, which is now Newark school inspector said in this week an interview one of the most important elements to close performance gap is is to extend the traditional public school year which currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
We must increase 200 days the school year to approximately, to have the power to change, said Janey, which last year joined with his teacher Union agreement on 185 days per year, which he regarded as "a milestone" towards a larger increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than prospect
The coach reached Gettysburg College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, get off and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and the Emerald lawn.
Gracielas parents have completed hardly high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela which was rescued in Silver Spring, and now lives in Riverdale, had set a foot never on a college campus.
An ehrfurchtsvollen visitor than an enthusiastic future student was your position and the other Achtklässler of of group that explore Gettysburg where classes per year costs 38.690 $ more.
"Yes!" "I will be here soon!" Graciela which would like to study medicine as the leader announced they had now enter the science building is called.
"Wow, really?" she said thought, as it the low professor student ratio school was reported.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7 children on their three-day tour visited and now they have completely received the intended message: the question is not whether it's College's.
The question is where.
On the one hand there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States Hispanic immigrants which stop the high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand there are hundreds of also thousands, receiving college training is necessary to move in the middle class.
In fact one College completes five this "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner - what is a remarkable performance as many immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America to the United States came without having completed high school.
Your stories are important, say researchers because they show the way forward for a generation which will play a huge role in the workers of the country.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and a power inherent in them to success.
Many of them have parents who set high goals to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But consulting programs play a major role by help Graciela and millions of children how to come to the College particularly, continue these efforts for a long time.
When looking at einkommensschwache children, whose Eltern have the experience and skills to help them in the path search system then a single measure at any time will not fix also, said Patricia Gandara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, which examined hispanoamerikanische students.
We must consider those children up to the high school to provide a supporting network of the preschool.
The Federal program that had funded Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - faster A course - and provides more than $ 300 million per year for local school systems available to start college preparation programs, which begin if einkommensschwache students in the school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of education it has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which 60% at the College are gone.

There are long no further items in Iraq.
Security concerns which have been underlined by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military have held American oil companies probably of said analysts to engage more in Iraq which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, particularly Chinese, and other State-controlled energy companies have significantly lower labor costs and take more risks because they must accountable not shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were single American companies that have contracts with the Ministry.
Major US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil Ministry and with technical advice were in recent years are considered empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two this weekend zugesprochenen contracts.

Eide departure takes place as the Obama Government has decided to send more than 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Envoy said he supports the troop increase but he pressed out his concerns about the military withdrawal which begins in 18 months schedule of us could lead other NATO governments withdraw their forces.

Commitment must be in the long term.
Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other Militärmächte also, increasing the number of international civilian aid workers to help the political transition in Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he lays down his Office but only one meets reached agreement in March 2008 with his family to stay only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted notification to United
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now forward, have time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better begins to find a successor said oaths.
When I came here there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and I.
Ban began the search for a replacement in accordance with UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish Italian roots Staffan di Mistura, directed by the UN Mission in Baghdad recently and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, has previously directed UN peacekeeping operations.

US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the Weltmächte soon "significant additional sanctions" over Iran impose because he participated in discussions about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen by Kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran played down.
In Iran there are no good ways the choice he said such development in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood.
"One of the things that are on the soul, is if we learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama Government draws a sanctions package in recital, aimed at the military and political elite of Iran but Gates announced that some sanctions could affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "Package of positive and negative incentives" is required "to the Iranian Government to persuade is less protected with nuclear weapons in fact", because "their people extremely" will suffer the penalties.
On Friday Robert Gibbs, the American Government has the European Spitzenpolitikern in the joined in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, that Iran must face "credible" consequences if he meets the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atom monitoring organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear programme.
Iran still claimed knowledge of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes should be obtained.
In discussions in Geneva on 1. October said Iran would resume talks to reduce its nuclear programme and would give up a substantial part of its inventory of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed his medical reactor nuclear fuel.
The Government has pressed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
Iran seems to have - but leave the provisional agreements negotiations in part since experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided, whether they should commit to the United States.
Iran simply are has left the international community to some proposals which they beginning October already had agreed, has the international community, including the Russians and Chinese in an open gates said said, zusammengebracht as they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions against Iran,.
President Obama has the 31. Dec a deadline Iran is fixed to respond before he pursue other options, including those that the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crushing penalties" to these proposals.
An opinion expressed in New York condemned Iranian representation at the United Nations which called "gratuitous and speculative assertions" some Security Council members about the Iranian nuclear activities on Thursday and said they are willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Nuri al-Maliki met gates which should return to Washington last Friday in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister, before he flew in the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq meeting with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish authority representatives in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular on limits, property rights and public revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays the US plans to reduce American power until August 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concerns about the forthcoming withdrawal. US representative of cited gates, who said to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We will receive your security, your well-being and your autonomy within a United Iraq."
"We will not leave you."
A change in price in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda profile, which they held lectures that "mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "A baby means a grave".
These lessons they so well learned that, as government officials in Shanghai, which suddenly began to change the course this summer by the low birth rate and the increasing older population and ermunterten young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "to do".
We already have our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang 31, a Personalleiterin with an 8 month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern affectionately called "little emperors", draws up a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, provides the United
Department of population, while the number of the community of 60 years and older in the year 2020 16.7% of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent explosively to rise. This is well above the global average of 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich villages with educated people such as Shanghai.
Last year 60-Jährige and older have identified nearly 22 percent of reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate in one child per pair is located.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghaier Stadtbevölkerungs-and Familienplanungskomission said that couples of reproductive age must get babies "to help reduce the ratio of the ageing population shares and alleviate the Arbeitskräftemangel of the future".
Shanghai will soon to alt - but not so rich - as the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden, be"," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978 by the ruling Communist Party until today introduced anchors, China's one child policy should probably be the most controversial available.
Couples who violate this policy must expect huge fines - up annual to their triple salary in some regions - and discrimination at the workplace.
Chinese Government representatives have this policy attributed it could avoid the critical use of natural regional resources while human Rechtsvertreter have condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women had a child to abort.
Many couples had have also gender selektive abortions, which was an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, officials have gradually weakened its position to the one-child policy for people.
2004 they have allowed more exceptions usually members of ethnic minorities and cases in which husband and wife have - been Einzelkinder - including townspeople, and 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was diminished.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University Population Research Institute said that officials discussed recently even of more radical changes, for example to allow pairs two children where a partner is only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters which belehrten families have only one child, have been replaced almost overnight policy in detail describe who is eligible for a second child and how you can apply for authorisation.
The municipality has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, home visit pairs and durchzuschieben information sheets on the doors.
She are also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for the available which have more than one child.
Family planning officials said the response was not encouraging.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a rise in applications of pairs is who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts, however, no change log.
Huinan town with a population of 115.000 enter only four or five requests for example still per month.
Disillusioned Shanghai officials say that the number of births in the City despite the campaign expected in 2010 – are still at approximately 165,000 slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Municipality Caolu, family planning Committee said that financial considerations probably were the main reason why many people want to have more children.
They want to give the best their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to two children and it is also legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese only a minor health and life of the Government.
Without a social network, saying, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely rate the one child policy as human rights, said Yang, a civil engineer whose women is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, one idea we can have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples specify psychological reasons for their reticence.
Wang, Personalleiterin, said she would only a child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used that everyone has looked after us."
"We are not accustomed to concern ourselves to others and not really want it.
Chen Zijian, a 42-Jähriger owns a translation company said unverblümter.
For parents from SMEs with double career which reduce the birth rate, he said, is to be successful and that you have to be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-jährigen grew up so their parents fight during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiment to see and not they want a life for themselves, he said today.
A single child, he said makes huge demands of the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social lives at least for two years.
Then there is the question of space - "man must rebuild his home" - and life planning - "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have at hand a CV for the best Vorschulen."
Most of his friends are ready once sick, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first which reaches a higher standard of living, he said.
We want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group designs the reduction plan
The climate conference sponsored by the UN - which brought by wild poses and mutual accusations so far - has set back a focus on Friday with the release of a document, which collects ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with developed countries in the near future should cope the biggest loads.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases has both was the remaining obstacles from, shown as the way forward.
But he was regarded as an important step forward in a negotiation is time because more than 100 politicians from all over the world in Copenhagen will arrive next week.
The text that was formulated by a UN team specifically created is from about the amount of money which should provide a rich countries to poor countries, enabling them to solve global warming short and long term.
It offers a range of options for key questions, including how industrial and large countries allow their carbon emissions and the upper limit of global Temperaturanstiegs should be what the policy makers would support.
Representatives of Sierra is awarded, so John Coequyt, senior great flexibility the process Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, designed the sechsseitige document has combined long Verhandlungstext a 180 pages, to make that focus on what the climate protection leaders of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer has called "big things".
It shows the layout of a possible agreement which the developed countries together would reduce emissions to 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with the limits of 1990, while larger developing countries would reduce during the same period 15 to 30 their emissions per cent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions to 2050 to 50 to 95 percent.
The European Community has the talks on Friday also a boost through their assurance given that the next three years provide $ 3.6 billion per year to help poorer countries, the impact of climate change adapt - masters of floods and droughts to avoid the deforestation.
The Friday still brought the same verbal Fireworks which had appointed the talks last week.
The American climate Sonderbeauftragte Todd Stern rejected formulations compared with voluntary reductions for larger countries require mandatory reductions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, if funded by the developed countries.
This move announced the Obama Government goes a harder line with China as the Bush Government two years ago.
The United States are not subscribe without get larger countries and measures so star that also complained that the text go not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern was with his opinion one hour Declaration of Chinese Lieutenant außenministers Ho Yafei off that pronouncement mangele the leading American climate Unterhändler either to "reason" or "highly irresponsible" he was he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would help China not financially to cope with global warming.
This future economic driving of large Weltmächte is at stake, broken lines have opened themselves within the industrialized countries and between the developed and emerging countries.
The current battle refers equally to save individual economies and to save the planet with China and the United States is befehden due to their corresponding obligations while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica said that it not surprising was the great powers struggle, because even affected countries have moved who should pay for the braking of greenhouse gas emissions, this, this aggressive approach, drag the countries with high greenhouse gas tax for their deeds to account.
This is clearly a game what a new economic domination will develop, so Ulate which operates as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries of that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change gave to that they still would be to fight a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen although leading participants say the talks at best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of small island countries with 43 members presented a 24-seitigen draft to the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, said that the offensive of the small island States "has political pressure on the entire political process," because she now combines are partial and demand action from the emerging economies such as China and India, Commission directs the international climate negotiations.
The talks were a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most issues even before the Government leader must be resolved to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives of Indian environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister emerged their aircraft and rest through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to establish claims negotiated during the next week.
The only extent of Assembly - 13,000 people go a day in the Congress Centre and, guitar playing activists organize nightly shows where they get funny about the countries which they felt betrayed and sell, and contract drafts are passed from hand to hand instead of by email - is a challenge already.
Just builds up the intensity: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 Government leader in Copenhagen will be.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for global policy of organization Conservation International.
The projects come.
Britain's first 225 km/h faster train redefined the Monday feeling
Montagmorgen by 5 am 13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness announcing a train departure represents a revolution in transport in the UK.
During his Flash of Ashfort, Kent, and after London St. Pancras, reach 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes to travel the first high speed pendler train in the country.
To Lord Adonis, the Transport Ministers will then Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter services from London go.
He hopes the new service UK finally connect to an international network of fast, reliable trains and London will bind the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to.
The neglected province could become living commuter towns, work anfahrtszeiten would reduce radically and change of air and rail car would reduce the national carbon emissions and traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties believe in this vision.
But the many British £ billion, are required for the construction of a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage might entail still the brake at the British high speed Rails.
High speed two (HS2), a company based in January that should the Government present a feasibility study, is Lord Adonis according to the times report 30. December hand over.
This, he gives a detailed route card of the next planned stage of high speed schienennetzes.
The new line which will connect the West Midlands London, is vorbeiführen with a margin of five metres in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site show the plan the concept within a distance of 25 M from the final track.
HS2 to create three options for a larger, northward leading high speed rail.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed is a Y-förmige routing in which a single high-speed line in the West Midlands would lead.
The route would share in or nearby Birmingham and lead a junction West of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another toward the Northeast after Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems the best good option," said a rail inside.
Upon completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh on 2 hours 40 minutes would reduce.
The first flight stage would be opened before 2025 would allow passengers to go London-Birmingham line compared with today about an hour in 49 minutes.
The designs were trains can travel, which the British railway network would the fastest Europe at a speed of 400 km/h.
The first course was scheduled to 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 persons can move.
Up to 18 trains could be per hour on the London-Birmingham line in operation.
This in turn would mean that in London a terminus would be necessary, 20,000 passengers per hour could be put.
An existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network expected given the spatial limitations in the capital.
Railway experts say have this potential only St. Pancras International or Euston.
Lord will announce Adonis whether this plan should continue to believe or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But if it is set the wheels in motion, the network sections must be built.
Trains should first switch of the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the North of Birmingham, which the travel time between London and Scotland would be continued for over three hours.
It is considered crucial pop point ensure a change of air to rail, a Richtmaß for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are on mortgage for 75,000 pounds Orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading federal Member of the conservative taxpayers every year thousands of pounds for the cost an Orangery in invoice raised, which he built in his house in his constituency read.
The prison spokesmen of the party was demoted because he complained about that federal members must live "on meagre rations", by David Cameron has increased its mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build an oak half-timbered cultivation to his Zweithaus in Rutland.
He was allowed to make the additional amount of interest charged to the taxpayer, a total of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons have approved at the time the applications and they were questioned not of Sir Thomas Legg, conducting a review of the expenditure of Federal members. Last night Duncan said that applications could have "not clean or comprehensible".
Duncan, one of the richest Federal members has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Houses in nearby have made a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the fees Office, an output unit of House of Commons agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year it has grown a winter garden called "Orangerie" plans.
Neighbours described him as "Glasshouse entertainment".
Duncan was asked during a recent examination of its previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on standards and privileges not taking increased money to comment.
The Committee has acquitted him last month according to a study of its expenditure by breaking the rules.
2004 Duncan has transferred the security of a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) House of his London on his Wahlkreishaus, which he in 1991, one year bought before his election to the Member.

In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncans RBS mortgage rate has not changed during this time, which suggests that the entire increase served to finance taking money from 75,000 pounds (85,000 euro).
The normal infinitely variable RBS Hypothekenzins fell 7,94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where he still is.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan claimed his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in this may continue.
Duncan lost his post as leader of the opposition of House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him in, when he said after the output scandal members "of meagre rations" would live.
"In essence it means working for the State, you must live by meagre rations and treated as S * e.
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and entitled to a tiny small percentage rise in terms of what is heard."
"And I would claim the whole damn sum but I do not."
The Member millionaire from his earlier career as oil wholesalers, attacked first in May because of its expenditure when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had settled with the fees Office that this "could be regarded as excessive demand".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of a pound character as protest in Duncans lawn after known became he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
As he yesterday night increased mortgage was questioned, Duncan said: "This was approved following the fees Office, both out of Legg to the value increase."
He even added: "There is no debate on fallback and Durchschlängeln or a bending of the rules and the like."
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and all.
"It could be not clean and clear."

UDF (Union for French democracy) Party Alliance is energetic and prompts the Nouveau Centre Party no longer to use their seal
Has the party allied MoDem is monitored by François of Bayrou's Party, on Friday to a takeover attempt of the seal of the party once by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the Chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, violently reacted and on pain of a judicial prosecution asked it to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Announces publicly his intention Morin, to accept this UDF seal because he was of the opinion that François Bayrou would be unworthy to defend this political heritage after he had served the hand to the left.
Defence Minister, whose is the UMP party partner NC to reaffirm also wanted this strategy on Saturday before the National Council.
To emphasis of its efforts he had contact now support the members Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP), NC, collecting a right to title of branded UDF because he has requested this brand 2004 first at the "Institut national de la Propriété industrial".
However, the business center of UDF Party Alliance monitored by François of Bayrous's friends broke the silence and gave clear not enteignen did and put the Minister and the members on pain of legal persecution a period, no longer use this seal and transferred ownership of the mark.
You have numerous declarations made in recent days, that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis zentristischen Alliance take signed writing including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, wrote the Party Alliance one in 19 of the 24 members of the Office of the party.
They also thought had the right to their political material, and on the home page of your site print the name of this movement Nouveau centre of slogans of today UDF.
As you know, have no right to use this seal, said the Office of the UDF and the party calls for NC "immediately to remove the reference of name UDF all material and (its) website".
Also we demanded by Hervé de Charette ", to transfer ownership of brand to their legal entitlement person entitled to rights".
If you deny this, we will take action against you respected the law and defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In its letter emphasize "UDF" is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978 and remind that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" 2007 to leave to start a competing movement as others 2002 had done it, "" to found the party UMP.""
The party Nouveau centre has therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the UDF seal (Union pour la dèmocratie française) to use.
You still recall that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 has approved three-year joining the party MoDem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, sets the Office, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name for three years no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefits from scandalous and fraudulent way and by the absence of the deposit of Akronyms UDF do this for themselves.
Still give to consider this thoughtlessness on track is to turn that into a crime and ironisieren the strategy the NC: "It seems to us but in politics and life dignified to make a name instead of trying to come by it is, so a name to fraudulently, it has no legal rights from the anonymity".

The Court decided now make a judgement after the process on the admissibility of Madame Bettencourt Meyers has occurred.
Manager revolution or end the strategic early stage?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
For over a decade, the position of managing large companies on its employees the consumer before the marketing revolution said the company position opposite: it is for the staff join "Values" determined best, as it was earlier on to impose the technicians in the consumer products designed.
By has the customer at the heart of the companies marketing revolution strategies of conquest of markets where given... Although the authoritarian temptation products disconnected to impose factors preferences of customers back regularly!
A demobilisation of employees can cause a fatal Demoralisierung.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA, Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon which affected in particular employees.
This demobilization negatively on the development of any organization's intellectual functions, in particular to those of F
In fact the IE calls (economic intelligence = intelligence Economique) "by all parties a proactive approach and a forward-looking view (…)"; requires the use of authoritarian management instructions completely contradict the employees.
We therefore call a business revolution, which would be equal to denMittelpunkt of concerns the company's employees in addition to the customer.
A conditional value of internal polls
Are internal polls as the questionnaire Orange has submitted its Lohnempfängern, stimulate this revolution on management practice?
I am not afraid.
-First, because I noticed that the entire fabric in a new situation as after many detours finally here primarily to do ...was always did.
Also because authoritarianism - pathologies of power proportional increases about the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because many executives take a strongly simplified of human behavior.
From the large Ingenieurschulen their interpretation of psychology is mechanistisch.
To apply the old behavioristische theory was reactivated and distributed unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and the media recently by the U.s. "neuroscience", by intellectual comfort.
Thereby and by suggesting that it is possible to press the "lever" (sic) on the commitment of employees an aktuellein Le Figaro.fr encouraged published survey by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system which is unsuitable for today's world.

Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of the modern company requires the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic log into any consideration or practice of control: the commitment to the company is only possible to achieve if it appears as a means to a part of their dreams, their Ehrgeizes and their projects for the workers.
Currently studies the multifunctional analysis only accept this concept of the motivation of the employees.

The war is of course the last, I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists there, she says.

Other opponents of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion of the Präsdent have done in Oslo "good work".
I found that was really very good, the former President of House of representatives, which recognized particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obamas frohlockte.
In some parts, empfunden habeich this speech entirely as historical, said Ginrich, which has been consulted in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The previous Member who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012 said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the left" members of the Nobel Committee reminded that "were not free and could not supply a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post Obama "a very American speech" did.
In addition to that he is as "Cosmopolitan" as "he always makes it", he "as an American President spoke", as he pointed out that the Europeans "live like a security bubble, have created themselves and they do little for their protection", to Gerson.
See the few rights not convinced the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a Hawk of Bush era referred to speech on the website of national review online as "boring, hochtrabend and inspirationslos".
To the left of the President is the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worries about how Barack Obama defended the fall back to the armed forces.
Packaged war under the guise of Justice can be easily justify the massacre of the innocents, he warned.
Press the moderate left remains still lobend alongside the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the view that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech even for one speaker like him who is known for his talent as a "Monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "offers a schedule to control the international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression", so impressed the California newspaper.
New York Times is view Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and referred to his speech as "dark and examples at the same time".

Stuttgart pad
Stuttgart 21 dimension is not high enough start.
For supporters of the project is purely and simply to "the new heart of Europe".
Right to. S21 is much more than a station Tieferlegen, more than a monstrous building fall city of Baden-Württemberg state capital for a decade in unmitigated site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Kopfbahnhöfe with tracks, ending in the city at that time considered marketing technical fossils of 19. Century, which had such as pads of a modern rail transport as needed once inordinate amount of time umzuspannen locomotives from back to front.
Enter, just keep, further driving - ´s to go.
And that is why the Kopfbahnhöfe should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a path station on the trans-European rail mainline halfway between Paris and Budapest, Bratislava slogan "Heart of Europe" is - therefore.
S21 is now actually addressed although visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners recognized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian city implement the Tieferlegen.
Kopfbahnhöfe, however, have no entry and exit problem more since modern turning trains with traction and control car at both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 in addition to the ICE new route to Ulm is now addressed.
State and local politicians have enforced.
The train makes with because bears the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of Republic of taxpayers and not the State company.
Städtebaulich is still reasonably justify the project.
New urban space is created, you believe – is the computer-generated graphics of Scheduler - equipped with greenery.
S21 is harmful for the transport system rail.
The Durchgangsbahnhof and route development are intended for the transport that you - typical 1980s - ascribed huge growth.
At that time were not competitive of low cost yet.
It must first involve modern transport policy to strengthen the carriage of goods transport by rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new line is due to violent upgrades for freight trains.
It is much more serious S21 tangential indirectly also many other railway projects.
EUR six billion to processors are buddelt in the Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
Is fixed, the next decade lack the money to other focal points and narrow bodies on the net.
Total sixty major projects are on the list of Verkehrsministeriums.
One of the most important is the development of good 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Built on line in a slow-motion pace since 1987
It is urgent here to press on the tube.
But S21 will act as a pad.
The Rhine Valley line becomes the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.

It is pretty darn difficult if we cannot keep his word, green head Tarek al Wazir said alluding to the FDP election slogan "Keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer Gümbel, the Government try to come to their Nachtflügen with "Legal processor Dreherei and Trickserei".
A close examination of legal need their time.
The coalition would operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal safe Entscheiung said Stefan Mueller (FDP).

Fast choice
It was then but everything faster than intended.
The sender can present a successor barely two weeks after the ZDF Board had pushed the President-in-Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender from the Office.
Last night, the body of the Personalie wanted to vote.
As a favorite, Peter was Frey, head of ZDF capital studios in Berlin.
Confirmation there by the sender for but not - officially not prejudging the procedure.
However, also played a role should have not to damage the ZDF director Markus Schächter, should this proposal when the Board of Directors in not get through.
Frey, Schächters candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 Board members.
The vote was uncertain even at time of writing this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter was failed with his proposal to extend the Treaty on the Administrative Board with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members were in favour of Brender, seven votierten against him. Brenders requires, however, was a massive defeat for Schächter, an erwartbare.
Because the majority of the Union Board of Directors had signaled even weeks before the election to confirm Brender in Office.
Organized the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had resistance to the editor-in-Chief.
The argument under Brender had lost the ZDF news audience, he refused a further term of hochangesehenen Editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was scourged therefore.
Recently even 35 Staatsrechtler in the debate had interfered, the action Kochs as unconstitutional estimated.
Used it is not.
Personal
Peter was the 4 Frey. Born August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education, and Romanistik.
Then he worked for the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey joined the ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".

Kochs adversary on the Board of the Rheinland-pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck last week said the countries should the ZDF State Treaty change so that personnel proposals of Directors can be blocked by a majority of politically motivated.
However, Beck ruled out a portion of Parteipolitikern from the supervisory bodies of ZDF.
Brenders anticipated successor Peter Frey had is the Board of Directors with a wise move recommended - by immediately criticised the Panel after violently for Brender requires.
Thanks to this document of journalistic independence Schächter without face for the entry of editor-in-Chief nominate and the Board of directors could choose him without coming in suspect to heave a partisan in the Office.
Frey in party arithmetic is already allocated the Linksliberalen.
Entrümpelt University
Teilerfolg for the students: after a year of education strikes of countries Kultusminister lenkten a Thursday finally: at a meeting of Kultusminister-and academic Rektorenkonferenz both parties agreed, to improve the Bachelor and master study conditions.
The students should be able in future to cope with their studies.
In particular they reached is that, to reduce audit costs: basically to complete each study module with a single audit.
Also to review the workload of students and ensure "a realistic and acceptable level".
Politics and universities want to also simplify recognition assessment services between universities within and outside of Germany.
The countries committed to flexibility common tree presets for Bachelor and master's degree programmes.
There should not be, different regional arrangements in.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Kultusminister and University Rectors bear the winged word of the better study access in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a specific meaning for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided partially drastically to reduce the number of tests: "Each module concludes with a review", says a 30-page paper that partially renewed to regulate the admission of courses.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Council Chairman said one should "Miscarriage be stopped, which significantly affected the study nature."
Also, the "study nature" in the future "the decisive criterion" in the design will be.
Modules such as content be "strictly to validate" whether "unnecessary Einengungen of students in choosing the"
"Events" would avoid.
The students were "Entitled to maintain margins, allowing initiative and encourage".
Apply the rules concerning the admission should new, but also in the review of existing programmes.
They must all five years ", akkreditiert" be - however, means it takes until 2015 to all programmes were checked.
Nationwide ten accreditation agencies, governed by the Accreditation Council set up by the countries responsible for this.
The Kultusminister had the countries in October "with emphasis" called to influence the agencies, that Stofffülle not too large and the inspection regime is not too strict.
In each State universities with national ministries on measures agreed.
So far only country Rheinland-Pfalz said this to additional funds for the development of the Bologna process.
The money to universities especially tutor programs set up and strengthen Studienberatung and audit and foreign offices.
Land and universities want to spend EUR 10 million for this.
Early 2010 the Government wants to bring to Parliament an amendment to the Hochschulgesetzes.
After this, only a single test should be required to complete of a study model.
Study design should be flexible, in addition to recognition ensures performance credentials at other universities and facilitate access to the master.
To check all programmes of the country in their study designed to end next year.
Government and the opposition had again on Thursday study of the conditions in the country gestritten.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
Bundesvorstand Juso Hochschulgruppen called the design of education policy should take place in the future more "behind closed doors" Ministers and higher education directors.
At the latest after the education strikes should now students as affected "a say say".
Support the future graduates received from President (HRK), Margret University Rektorenkonferenz Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Kultusministern that HRK through a joint reform paper discussed.
The trade union education and Science (GEW) were the Bonn decisions as a whole does not go far enough: calls entitled access to an advanced masters course possible each graduates with a Bachelor's degree.
On the other countries must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor students tomorrow sufficient master studienplätze with the best possible study conditions, GEW Director Andreas Keller.
The countries must set more teachers.
To a freer access to the master the Kultusminister not expressed itself, however.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
"Go down in Germany and is beautiful almost no control..." is Anfangszeile of of a poem of Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which it addressed the arrival experience of a dissidents in disturbing language rag, obtained the freedom, but also lost its language area.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat had first as German and English teacher worked in Bucharest and later as lecturer in a children's Publisher before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been recognized with various Literaturpreisen, 1993 he was the legendary Frankfurter Poetik lecture at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of Hessian literary forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He was last Tuesday during a meeting in New York which was to "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorting mirror of their Securitateakten" substantial non literarisches vehicles.
Visibly verunsichert and route he made Söllner before Rumänien German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his work a declaration as IN the eingestand for the Romanian secret services Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner had 1989 received the German language prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun insidiously, first in 1971.
I am, Castle Söllner, "so who is has enough gewehrt against attempts of the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IN the Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel prize ceremony for Herta Müller and whose unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule is the literary scene and in particular the community which shaken coming German authors by a case the chasms and evil of a political system identified makes, on monitoring and founded Bespitzelung from Romania.
Werner Söllner is, so far as to say after previous knowledge, not only the perpetrators and victims.
In his Securitate file have played a role IN the Walter, said after the confession of Söllners of politician Michael Markel and referred to the influence positive for him of IN the Walter.
He did it in all respects was difficult for him "herausgehauen", so Markel.
He was a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners statement was in the form and is the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret services is not entirely surprising before this unexpected audience.
Germany was a cosy reserve for Securitate informant, had already written in July in the Herta Müller, after she had read their own Act, 914 pages.
Those concerned so you should expect are speculation and also known in some case, what clear name is concealed Sorin, Voicu and also Walter behind the aliases.
Unlike in the procedure safe in this country become quite screening of Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been sabotaged in recent years and impeded.
A National Council appropriate Birthler authority to the processing of Securitate files (CNSAS) was established in 1999 only, the publishing of files was since then but rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law which regulates the management of files.
That influence of former Securitate members in Romania was an interview in which is a former Securitate chef from Temesvar abfällig expressed about the winner after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller is still very large.
She have a psychosis, finally we have interrogated them only once.
The infamy of power said quite blatantly in the form of free speech to can express itself.
Certainly inevitable questions make themselves the case Söllner, as so often in the verschwiegener fault.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The measured response of listening to Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by Wissensdrang as blame and shame rather.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.

Allegedly a promotional company now plans to fight Klitschko in London Wembleystadion.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from opposition: Green Fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg due to incorrect information about the Kunduz affair liar.
SPD, left require investigation of the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - for the most recent discoveries to Luftangriff Kunduz has assumed a deliberate deception the opposition Defence Minister Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU).
The Minister had the deadly bombing on two tank lastzüge September "knowingly the untruth"said green Fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin said Saturday in the ARD news programme"news".
This is called conventionally: he lied.
The kill command is issued in violation of the rules of the international security assistance force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report had NATO, reading Mr Guttenberg, said excuse.
On Friday two Talibanführer was to become known that it was not only to a destruction of the abducted Vice in the attack, but also targeted killing.
The US Luftangriff requested by the German Kunduz Commander Colonel Klein were according to NATO report up to 142 people killed and injured were.
Green, SPD and Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) left called on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what really did know Guttenberg about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Government of Afghanistan policy - and whether Bundeskanzleramt, Bundeswehr and Messenger services have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and green Mrs Renate Künast called for.
Regierungssprecher Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticisms.
The Bundeskanzleramt took effect on specific missions of the German armed forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts to the look of the Ministry on the background to the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Mr Peter Wichert became loud.
According to information of mirror both Guttenberg have informed correctly and completely the backgrounds of the tank truck attack.
It was officially welcomed they had denied the existence of NATO reports and the Minister denied sensitive details.
It was however from the environment of the two top officers that it the Ministry of defence had stressed even several reports, including a two-page document of command demonstrated Colonel Klein and a Feldjäger report.
Wichert should have now asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, the "Frankfurt General Sonntagszeitung" reports.
He have not so far received a reply, it means.
The Ministry said on Saturday to the allegations and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which will constitute on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in intelligent State and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug noise blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we cannot indulge unrestrained wildest imagination and Phantasiegebilden.
Who in the waking awareness experienced dream-like States, sees things and hear, which others cannot see or hear, considered in the modern Western world mostly crazy or drogensüchtig at least as a nerd.
But such images and voices arise not only with mental health or drug noise.
Blame has our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses to paint pictures or write novels ensure sometimes the boundaries between dream delusions and reality become blurred.
Modified dream-like watch bewusstseinszustände can occur in various forms, at best, we call them visions in the worst case delusions.
When triggers and effects may differ, the visions can be Mystikerin Hildegard von Bingen attributed drug experiences of new-age prophets Carlos Castaneda, shamanic Entrückung States, psychosis, and hallucinations in similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise where the balance of neuronal have materials of the brain - dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - derailed all and interaction of various parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occurs during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power more about him
Context delusions and dream has been since ancient philosophers and doctors.
Aristotle understood hallucinations Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry as a form of dream in the waking state, 1861 detected a "great similarity of Irreseins with dream States", for Sigmund Freud's dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, cow formations, Sinnestäuschungen of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning turns t. into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaking colourful.
Gravity has no power more about him, it floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged Devil figures with blutroten, warping dominated zähnefletschend.
Chase it, get it with heavy, flaming boots, throw it against the walls, he feels the pain to the whole body.
Loud, malicious voices ring of walls and radio.
He can they tolerate no longer, the voices that swear at them and insult.
Henning t. tear two cables from the stereo, knotet to a loop and mounted on a hook on the ceiling.
It rises to a loudspeaker and sets the loop around your neck.
Jumps.
The loop dissolves.
It should be you a lesson, cry votes in trommelfell zerfetzendem choir "go in the clinic and let heal you!"
Today is Henning t. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is back 2 years, the first almost 20 years.
She triggered on LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, he is also a manisch-depressiv, he takes drugs against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has married for three years.
I have seen worst fear and deepest despair in the psychosis, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
As a percent of the population had at least once in life to schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals it is treated as the second most common disease after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected can usually no longer distinguish between inside and outside world, they have an of erregten State, which can cause hallucinations, size, relation, or Verfolgungswahn.
Listening to the voice - voices that command, comment on, or dialogisieren is particularly widespread.
Also visual hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is able to separate important no longer from Unwichtigem, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, flooded the consciousness of impressions.
As the dream the psychosis opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies, come from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is subject-centric, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, physician of clinic for General Psychiatry in the Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the Centre of the event, everything has a meaning of it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, is much like in a dream, of the events overwhelmed and can not actively make them.
Schizophrenic feel often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A Realitätsabgleich is usually not able, cruel reality, waking the fantasies are excluded.
Once in the life of a hallucination experienced to have
Unlike in a dream, says Fox, "remains in principle but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in the psychosis.
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why our brains beats somersaults, provides researchers before puzzle.
Ausnahmezustände can cause when everyone that he temporarily loses the reality reference, Fox says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to the schizophrenia but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only decisive factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage when people.
We suspect the neural maturation of the brain at an early stage of development is disturbed by a Viruserkrankung of the mother during pregnancy for example explains Fuchs.
But remain a mystery as reached the disruption of neuronal systems, which do not manifestiere also first for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if disposition.
Also hallucinogenic can cause psychosis drugs because they interfere in the transmitter system.
If your brain is hot running
Is the crazy, Psychotiker suffer their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of it, others give out money for drugs which to get the Lübecker psychology professor Erich box says.
Often only a matter of the position is whether fantasies are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant.
Box collects reports on hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen for ten years, in the past year he has evaluated its findings in the book "The false world in our head".
Hallucinations are but the typical side effects of psychosis, but of surprisingly many other diseases.
This includes often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's Schädelhirntraumata next to mental disorders such as borderline or depression.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people halluziniert under certain conditions.
Hallucinations to box are composed of memory content usually withheld.
You are processed old brain areas are überaktiv or too little suspended; hot running our brains or although missing stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like brain damage or a psychosis.
But also stimulus deprivation, stress, Liebeskummer, or other mental Ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies up to one third were to at least once in their lives have experienced a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah k. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visited the school.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there were pictures and voices.
During the break, sometimes it's a schlaksiger boy with long dark hair.
If he responds, the fellows look at surprised it - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They consider the timid girl versponnene day Träumerin but not dreaming Sarah k., knows it.
It is awake, hears and sees these boys just as they that hear girls at the Bank next to itself and sees.
She can even feel his presence at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is, like the young.
Am I crazy?, she asks sometimes.
But she know this boy and other fantasies are not real is and disappear.
At night the appearances are often frightening
Often, the fantasies are a burden.
If it sits in the classroom, she cannot accept sometimes the Unterrichtsstoff, because the teachers in their eyes and ears presents just a new Fellows while he audible and visible says mathematical equations for everyone else at the table.
At night the appearances are often frightening.
If it waits in their dark rooms sleep that is much too rare and far too late, she can not distinguish often, whether it is alive or already dreaming, the images that sees it, the faces or girl with bleeding cuts on arms and legs before their open or closed eyes are.
Let me alone, cry to the figures.
She tells parents and friends nothing, which would keep them mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah k. is now 20 years old.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it has included box in the Internet contact to the psychologists, she knows is not crazy.
Delusion is a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffer stimulus deprivation he has hallucinations, likely after a while box says.
I suspect the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and ensures even for his entertainment.
Sarah k., an only child had little girl often played fear other children alone.
Your hallucinations began when she learned that her natural father is the man she called dad since she can think 13.
Because when Visual and acoustic hallucinations same brain areas are active process also real impressions and noise, it is difficult k. affected as Sarah to different illusions and reality. "Each experience," says box, occurs in the brain, the reality is out there.
The hallucinations are also images that rise to the brain, so they act as real.
Box evaluates also nocturnal Traumbilder as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy not fundamentally different from an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic healthy able to recognize their fantasies as unreal are gramburg.
Box advises patients therefore appreciate the hallucinations as special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our very awareness-centric world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologisiert says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, suffering full disease, but it is also positive, creative - delusion is a work of art from despair.
Schmidt Degenhard has studied the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special type of modified dream-like waking consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, the Erlebende holds for real and he also subsequently may be different from the Wachzustand.
The oneiroide State is trauma-or disease-related situations, for example in Polyradikulitis patients who experience a motor paralysis with full awareness.
If a man of self and world loss is threatened by continued, complete paralysis, it replaced the life-threatening real situation by an own imaginary world that is decoupled from reality says Schmidt Degenhard.
An art border state between dream and hallucination.
Because dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, the real situation is but presents in the imagination.
An intensive form of meaning and Sinngebung in itself intolerable situation, us people own design capability allows submerged in a nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, also later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as rescue operation of the soul.
It is 49 years old when his consciousness for days goes after a heart operation with followed by Herztransplantation travel, while his body intensive care to stillness is doomed.
Claussen plunges into a self geschaffene world, visited other times and places: he experienced as bedridden, old man on board a train sanatoriums, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early middle ages under noblemen to Rauschmittel from blood.
Is kidnapped by a Greeks on motorcycle in its own country SURFs his hospital bed in the Firnsnow of the Alps and is a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, also later in memory.
This internal travel differ substantially from each dream for Claussen.
Dream is a different State, he describes his experience.
In contrast the memories from mental travel are abundantly clear me after years and trivial details.
More and more even than really Erlebtes.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other life weltlichen experience, says Schmidt Degenhard psychiatrist.
In the end Oneiroide, psychosis, hallucinations and drug noise show our inner images of Outer reality in the guards are how brittle.
Any change of Bewusstseinszustandes, sums up the box, psychologist "can a deformation lead to what we call reality."
An experience that can be also enriching.

Burda
Children should take the Publisher with 27
The new publishing Chief Kallen is a solution: long-term Hubert Burda will give his company in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The holding company will belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - the Publisher Hubert Burda long-term sees his company in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the fixed will enter into the company of 69-Jährige said the mirror.
Precaution we have regulated the details.
The question whether they are active in the company, provides it.
Also the question whether they are able to do so.
You can offer his children not 7500 employees if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This brings to the children and the company also.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from January of the Presidency of the Board and Paul Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
52-Jährige Kallen is Director Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, which for direct marketing, international, pressure and finance came with scope Treasury responsible for the company assets to and after the withdrawal of Jürgen Todenhöfer.
No family member at the top of the Publisher is thus for the first time.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, which would be today 42 years old, died some years ago.
Kallen naming also serve to bridge 10, 15 years", so Burda".
The holding company should continue to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda expressed, family business before the fall are sure: "It was always families who infect themselves were of a capital addiction which is entirely verspekuliert and thought they could get to the big player."
My strategy was never.
He had "never Weltmacht dreams" so Burda.
I as it was Springer, am as political Präzeptor of this country, and I will also play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too large.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is limited to äuβerst, a device with which you can read his E-mails without a way certain annexes see to surf through the Internet or to it.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of Fame when it was time magazine to one of the products of the year.
Is unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea itself is still above all for young people of interest.
Unlike the Smartphones costs very little peek and has one very affordable flat rate, for example only half of the price of an iPhone Flatrate.
After the company has seen the success it has brought two new devices: one that is intended only for Twitter and the other with a lifelong Gratisservice data contrary to peek in which you must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek yesterday, Le Web was presented at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise at hand.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone about 12 euros a month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone to the world already know what it means to give up all the data, to read his email once it has hit the border or man desperately for a café with WIFI searches (or a connection option with FON).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should be possible for a really long.
It is true that some carriers offer already special contracts and pricing for placements, but my experience needed has a PhD in physics and a good pair of glasses to read the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission on affordable Roamingtarife for Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb of their own countries has man always afraid to read his mail and justly.
That a small device such as FonPeek (where it is but always surprising that it has the name FON although it has no WiFi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone company slowly but surely recalibrate and start must, to consider various options how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, download books and further inquiries on the Internet is included in its prices.
No contract and no hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay only once, namely the purchase and not every month.
And this is what I expect one day of FonPeek, a buying opportunity with lifelong access as it already offers the peek in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with your phone, thanks.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a better model for the consumer.
It would be but interesting time to be able to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle fetish color
The American first lady favourite colour is yellow.
Appeared in a dress and a coat of color at the Barack Obama took office as President of the USA and has selected again same color to him in his, undoubtedly to accompany the second most important moment in his life: the presentation of Friedensnobelpreises in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken very similar models on two occasions: auβer it was nearly the same color - a glossy grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric and this was somewhat groβförmig gesticktes or a necklace.
It is even where it had appears at first sight the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes in the type of material from which they are very differ.
At the inauguration, it a dress from top and Oslo one was from patterned velvet.
The accessories were different: the first time, shoes with half-height paragraphs and the second time Green a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
The hairstyle was different every time: the hair were ambitious on this occasion as Haarkranz, when the previous she openly wore hair.
75% of working mothers have problems at work due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger women to have children.
This result is the study of CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for women "Fertility and career of women in Spain".
The survey, 9.737 women between 15 and 75 is in no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market due to their maternity limited.
The study exposes a family to found and the children there wide differences in the decision, depending on whether women work or not and if so, they exercise what kind of work.
Those of them auβerhalb of the House doing no other activity only half day working or have no fixed contract be mothers more and have more children.
In contrast, move women with a fixed employment in the public sector, the creation of a family and maternity and therefore fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with fixed employment get its first child on average only 3.7 years after the pucker a number increased to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment which longer took to achieve this and much later implemented their pucker and first child have."
"Furthermore has the type of work a major influence on the maternity albeit less than calendar regarding contraceptive rescue", explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in age of women in the marriage and the first child.
According to survey the age at the time of the marriage and the first child is the education more higher.
This difference could be determined in the same age women.
For example the women in the group between 35 and 49 were, depending on whether they have the graduating or a higher education on average each with 25,1 or 32,1 first mother.
There still, depending on their level of education, another difference between women.
While women with Hauptschluss final already before its first full time get married and get their first child, women with a medium or high school make around exactly differently and only search a full time and marry then get its first child finds Delgado.

Cowardly aggression
70-Jährige MOM went walking last week by our neighborhood village Fuenlabrada when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years in addition to her and our dog herliefen our dog is a mixed breed from the sanctuary, we have taken, which weighs just six pounds, and then from the blue missed him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard.
You may not take our indignation in words because it is incomprehensible to us, where since the fun with a cheap Agression against a small hilfloses animal should be, which of course ran on the leash.
Additionally the Erstickungsanfall received a women walk comfortably went, as she wanted zurechtweisen these people because of the incident was afraid even to their own lives as a lunatic attacked a dog, it is a child, an older Mr same perhaps with a woman, or probably even making with each is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhood to five p.m. ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has all day long geheult.
Of course we have refunded display in a nearby police station, we have, however, but serious doubts whether it will bring something and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to only clarify the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to view it.
We cannot understand what needs to be in the minds of these young people that they find funny for a cheap attack on an hilfloses animal to an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people are gone.

9.425 Vehicles approved in November in Spain mean an increase of 12.6 %in reference to the year 2008, and what is even more important, they are the first increase it at all after 22 consecutive months with developing fall library the figures presented by the Manufacturers Association of Anfac and the Ganvam Auto Dealers Association.
These good figures are however only groβer caution to enjoyment are the reference data should be included in the comparison of November 2008, which was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a decrease of 60% for the previous year.
However, we must consider in that, apart from the increase in the last month, this 11 months total approvals are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous fiscal year.
Total 95.853 vehicles have been sold since January, but all vehicles makes up the Kleintransporter market are included in this number: descendants of passenger cars, Pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small truck/chassis.
There are still the same Gewitterwolken in the sky which drag demand most affected, because even though some private vehicles are purchased, is elimination of sales to small and medium businesses that purchase with a third-party financing in almost 100% of all cases.
You have about these restrictions, which are the result of zugedrehten Geldhahns of credit institutions or other factors with einschlieβen such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of economic decline.
This panorama and unlike the car financial support helped little buying a vehicle of 2000e plan.
This plan is not only for individuals, also independent and small companies have a right to if it is to buy a pickup 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, which may exceed not 160 grams per kilometre used but speak low sales figures for themselves.
Just yesterday again Ganvam had recalled that necessarily is required by the State to pay special attention to this small truck, and also industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealers Association prophesied a similar year as the straight past, that it anticipates a sales failure (for passenger cars and SUVs) 19% for 2010.
Helping Bremsmanövern in critical situations is duty now
As ABS has the Antiblockierbremssystem and as it happens right now with stability control ESP help systems must become a mandatory conditions in the European car braking in an emergency.
Actually they are already required for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a Karenzfrist has been fixed by end February 2011.
Misura adopted by the European Union has can, however, this braking systems aimed to improve the protection of the Fuβgänger because of its operation also help to prevent many Auffahrunfälle.
The task of emergency braking Assistant is more pressure on the brakes if a critical Bremsmanövers which detects the system based on the Bremsstärke carried out by the driver on the brake pedal exercise.
However, it exercises this pressure until the end.
According to a the component manufacturer for Bosch vehicles in order given investigation was on no longer one-third of the driver involved in an accident before the collision to occur on the brake pedal and half of them had braked with full power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake assistance, intervenes with maximum power in the braking system and reduces this braking time and hence the braking distance, which travels a car in the braking.
According to the EU up to 1,100 fatal accidents where Fuβgänger come damage could be prevented each year, if all cars with this type of emergency braking assistant were equipped.
There would be even less accidents - it expects could prevent every fourth accident involving injury - once the so-called intelligent emergency bremssysteme are popular.
Then equipped is the vehicle with a system that detects obstacles (using radar or a camera) and alerts the driver where it has at the same time have a pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then respond, the system, to increase the pressure if it would be necessary to the brake pedal helps him.
If the driver fails to respond to the warning even when the collision is already inevitable, brake assist exercises and the maximum pressure on the brakes, to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.

Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe trying to achieve: the affected page in advance gives its assent to every single point of the plan.
And for this reason, it may be the final document first presented the workers and then the Governments of countries where there are works that will move until early 2010.
Dementgegen is assured by GM, it will take a decision regarding sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturers so that it makes a decision as soon as possible.
GM is to with some possible new buyers in contact.
One of this buyer could be Geely that would like to buy up to Volvo, however, option of of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports car, which has support from the Russian group Converg, increasing support WINS.

Driving Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very costly jewel engineers the Boxster S as the basis and used but really managed to make it easier to 80 pounds which brings only 1.275 kg on the scale.
To create something so that it first on the automatic hinged roof which was replaced by a Zeltleinwand roof with manual drive failure, alone, it has saved 21 pounds; thanks to the aluminium doors used this model as the GT3 "more 15; by the exclusion of air conditioning disappear" again 13; it has reduced the fuel tank of 64 on 54 L auβerdem, thus further 7 kilos were saved; by installing sporting Bacquet seats 12 again and again five saving the light 19 inch rims.
It was by waiving the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and swapping the Knobs handles made of the missing kilo achieved.
Although it is available with the twin-clutch gearbox PDK, test drive a vehicle with 6 common hand gear was conducted mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California on mountain routes which were really very kurvig.
When his behaviour we can give perfectly the note.
Has reduced its weight, but not to geführtdass he now more to safely would be on the road.
It is rather the opposite: since long we have probegefahren already no longer a small and lightweight model, which gives one but also a sense of groβer security on the curves even at high speed.
It is a smaller athlete to able to make his muscles in a low gear warm until we commands give him to wild, brakes, to recover and then back to get everything from his engine out in the time it takes...
It makes everything they say it. The car makes everything we suggest him with our hands on the steering wheel thanks to his steering is just as communicative how precisely.
And he makes with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
Sound of its V6 Boxers with 320 HP (more than the Boxster S 10) is highly managed and still you can increase it with the sport-option and through a system change the motor noise can which for the first time was already in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, regardless of whether from standing out or again faster.
The suspensions are strong, not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on Landstraβen where we drove with Spyder Boxster was quite damaged but the car well mastered the begin.
The electronic wizards had to do almost anything; the entire route, although some of these curves we found ice in dawn and Rollsplitt in the morning.
In summary we can say that an ultra-light car is a car which is an indescribable driving fun, as it exists otherwise probably rarely and it much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster is SS.
In February 2010 on the market and 70.831 EURO cost car.

Team Ivanovic, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to regain air and one of them gun Mirza Teletovic which saw three consecutive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas to it, that on the display table again a beruhigender distance appeared (54-67), which could enhance the host at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) was suddenly.
The Alavesen were bloβgestellt in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced already, that they would allow anyone to erase them the victory they honestly had earned the first dreiβig minutes, again.
Nevertheless, not resignierten Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line from (70-77).
However, and although splitter due to Fouls of the space was available team Ivanović was off, well defended and although the Israelis aufholten at the last minute (80-85), the game had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.

Thank you very much!
After the verlockendsten days since last spring, where inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, the uncertainty is returned on the markets, which is surprising in any case because it is its natural state in an environment where agents make uncertain future decisions on one inherently.
Misura applied to stabilise the market was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to free hand in interest of liquidity, moving to zero so that in this way, the banks buy assets to settle.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets as well as end and begin without its heterodoxe policy liquidity in question, to sprinkle some sand in the gears as vormachte näc already the BCE with their annual auction taking place next week.
Therefore, the investors in the capacity of the global economy doubt the economic recovery without holding this heterodoxen Maβnahmen and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia.
Flüchtigkeiten of markets and the differences in the undertakings bonuses rise again even if they are still far removed from the paranormalen amounts achieved at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to nationalise the private risk and the public debt rise again.
It sets back to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred way of investors, leading in turn to an increase in the differences of the countries of the eurozone in terms of Germany.
Spain was affected until now little from this episode of instability, but then came standard
On the other hand, some uncertainty not to bring the defenders of moral risk silence had tried again, the leaders of the world policy should a sense for what they had caused to create because they had braked the devastating effects led to which the limitation of credits to the loss of jobs, actually had a new tag to beschlieβen thanks action as they harm.
Nevertheless what happened in Dubai indicates a root war between the Emiren, to return to power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also earlier predicted.
A Government which trampling the public debt, elections, and a new Government that draws on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense, Ecofin Hungary rescues beginning from the failure of their Auslandszahlungen and thus allowing a euro Member State, no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent, and to take its citizens when auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen need to maintain the stability of the State money in duty.
Yes, we find ourselves as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premia, after some excesses on excessive amounts, would be that now within the expected.
In the case of Spanish you must do not worry, as long as the differences of public debt increase at the same rate as the European company bonuses.
Should, however, reduce the European differences and the Spanish further increases, dannn would this be a special Spanish risk.
By default
Again it seems completely, that it is an excellent opportunity to Spanish shares although "Caution while driving" is at the moment.
