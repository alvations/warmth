The lack of snow in the mountains to the hotel
not only the peacekeepers telesques in Krkonoe are about the runways without snow.
The lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why, in krkonoe still can be rooms free for all dates, including Christmas Eve and.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The people look offers, checked prices, but still fear of with commitment.
And if we call, ask immediately on our opinion, if this Christmas will be snow or mud, "mentioned the portal information Spindl. Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to move in pindlerv mln a according to their expectations, should not hesitate more in reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of pindlerv Mln offer especially weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I believe that will continue, but soon and will provide stays shorter.
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlab, continues to offer beds free for all dates of winter.
Now, what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the offered remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some stays at the last moment, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlab can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoe, but there are fewer places free.
Sold very well the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regulate.
This year the interest in the winter is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoe.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to to the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the clues remain snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas will dry up, "thinks Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel in Pec pod Snkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five per cent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the latest free.
The interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, "reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the year are already engaged in the hotel, near the parking Jansk Lzn.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel Jansk Lzn at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are about to sixty percent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a bit weaker, but as fall snow, interest in the stays in Krkonoe will surely mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hotel of Krkonoe they will the appetite of snow waiting.
on Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there is rain in the mountains should nevar.
But then again rise temperatures, reported Ji Jakubsk Hradec Krlov, the Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of more intelligent man, as a diligent repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago.
not only in the same text is used several times the "as in Iraq", but do not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "a new way forward".
was he, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war. And that was it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today are talking about Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improve, however objectively left his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected.
in Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
The captains of field to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander - in - chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. him, even though the traditional subordinate relations, submitted to the rifles undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
Asked 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president for three months, but it was nothing better, so that at least the general about 10,000 military.
to get Europe promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most troublesome of the whole strategy of Obama seems, begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to this procedure in three years. The whole doctrine of Obama generated more questions than answers that offered.
Many doubt that the increase in the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organized, their leaders to respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement has been.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village after he will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because relations, even more complicated by the Pakistani influences and Iranian.
Even establish a state that is capable of action, "a minimum target for the entire operation, it seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy Obama clashes by his voluntarism.
over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who know nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, set the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as a statement of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begin the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential election and why there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
The directors of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year bonuses in cash.
The entity announced to react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, measures cannot be sold at a minimum period of five years.
Moreover, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that had assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the power in the long term.
I assume that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest journey that must, mentioned the former banking investor of the entity Douglas Elliott.
The devil is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after (almost $17 billion (almost 300 billion CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters, probably exceed, despite the measure announced today, the 20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for that exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712.000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.

The minister considers the resignation. Klaus I invited the castle
The President Vclav Klaus will receive on Friday morning to Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which is considering his continued rule, because it does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, adopted on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also the permanence of Janota in the cabinet, will be the subjects of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
On the citation reported the president spokesman Radim Ochvat.
On their stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163.000 million kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals from the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, are beginning to be controversial future activities of the cabinet of Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto the package of measures, imposed in the autumn by the government Fischer to curb the public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long been neglected "serious problem", that is, "the deficit" of public finances.
According to him today no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, can support a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolnek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The vice - president of ODS, Petr Neas, said to TK that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ssd, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words "strong sentences."
The head of SSD, Ji Paroubek, reacted to Topolnek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former government Topolnek. the 200 million kroner.
On Wednesday SSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular also were happy.
Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: invincible, much about the country, their fight and their victories, although some critics say that the roles played by American actors.
The history of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him in the film.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I said: "When I interpreted, will have to have access to you.
The actor and two years, who received the prize for his role in the drama on the world of boxing milion dollar baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up slave, the president of the US, and even of God in Evan. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, it is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their efforts to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - invincible is a Latin America and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk as he
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the team of South African rugby, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid their nation remains racial and economically divided.
Believes that is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why we decided to unite the rugby players, which belong to the extent to the.
The South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela to cinemas.
He had another goal to play this role in such a way that was as similar as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
of course, the greatest challenge was to as him.
The actor said that if he and the political world in the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that the apretarle hand, receive their energy, it is transmitted and had the sense of how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Franois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the world of rugby.
A big surprise to him was, when finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember pointing to the door, he opened and the first thing that I told Franois Pienaar in my life was in the film: "much higher".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the players and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: invincible received positive reviews and it also talks of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the magazine Daily Variety McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "it was a very good story, a very well done film."
In the reviews of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 per cent of positive assessments.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians did evidence of a missile
On Norway observed a special effect of unknown origin.
The Ministry of Defence ended up recognizing yesterday that near the border with Norway made evidence of an missile intercontinental ballistic.
The launch failed again. The missile, "Bulava", previously to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulav, in most cases, not flying or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers write "Bulav" as "a missile that not fly."
A missile that not fly, but conspicuous.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem.
at the end of the flight of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulav" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, floating in the White Sea.
This type of missile launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at once.
It is therefore likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, in reality outside the failed "Bulav."
The Norwegians like from the first moment that this were a Russian missile.
The generals are saying that this time cannot be simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In previous cases engines averiaron immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without mistakes, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost 50 per cent full of optimism to the generals and therefore still claim that "Bulav" one day fly without problems and even will take up to ten blocks hipersnicos nuclear, whose total weight is of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the unions. all the extra work
The direction of the car factory in Noovice agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, unions said on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vank, the spokesman of the factory automoviles Hyundai.
The direction, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a Saturday.
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan, it is essential that proposed voluntary extra work for the Saturday, 19 December, will work in two shifts, said Vank.
According to the server Sedmika. Cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 Czk employees who work the time on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid by last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaka, the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or can take a day on 28 December, prolonging a day, Christmas festivities mentioned Vank.
Moreover, all employees of the shifts on Saturday will receive money for travel and for food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, stop the production last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned Vank.
employees of the cars were forced to work two hours more shifts of eight hours every day and this situation continued until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions cancel the emergence of strike.
Another negotiation between the direction of the factory and trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kucha said on Wednesday that if they commitment to meet the requirements and signed the document, are prepared to cancel the emergency on strike.

A Czech discovery: a substance effective until in the Encallecidos' virus HIV
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans is evidence of new compounds capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance is the fact that it is also effective against viruses resistant to medicines.
in some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs accessible.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus were not completely removed, will create the so - called resistant virus; against them, no longer work medicines.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility to dominate the resistance of the virus.
Showed that substances called metalocarboranos have effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way to all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In his work scientists are new, improved compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a three - dimensional structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient
The proteasis HIV is a virus HIV, and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and mature and infectious Corpsculos of the virus.
If we stop the proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the the patient, body of the scientists in a press report published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short series organic, which continues to be amended.
A little weaker, but more effective
evidence of the effect of this series of substances against the proteasis HIV was conducted in tube, and also against their variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of Metalocarboranos in common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the medicines used clinically, however not lose their effect on the resistant, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, the low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, that the metalocarboranos are compounds interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, said Pavlna ezov, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetica in the Academa of sciences.
Heat for budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolnek said that the approved budget for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that it is time for analysis.
The vice - president of ODS Petr Neas said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of ssd, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if it wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracin towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Neas.
The Chamber of Deputies approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals by the left, by more than 12 billion kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of ODS, since cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote left the room and the desire of the government, that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusionment and the sense of futility; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Neas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals modificadoras, the situation could have been different.
According to Televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
Pointed out, which is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Neas in government have nothing to do the nominated by the SSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister also should clearly say, if you resign, if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolnek: The ministers nominated by the ODS are not
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, stressed in the news of the US.
Recalled, that in several ministries in the jobs of people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Neas stressed, that if Fischer decides the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit in public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left wing majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies".
But it will be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Defence Minister Martin Bartk, who was appointed to the government by members of ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS gave at the request of the Prime Minister
Neas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies probably would vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly calls to members of ODS which allow the acceptance of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned by the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations on.
I realized that my vote.
the mandate he knew, that in the following months they were especially bolchevizacin of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolnek.

By entering the gramilla in costume, which is seen as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won sustained applause, especially of the audience and the recognition of the white population.
The football perhaps will help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only black "in the national team in 1995.

Janura submit a complaint for slander to three hetmnes of SSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Janura today will submit a complaint for slander three Hetmnes Socialdemocrticos.
It is Haek in the region Jihomoravsk kraj, Radko Martnek of Pardubick kraj and hetmn of Olomouck kraj Martin Tesak.
Janura mentioned in 20 minutes in Radiournl.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing long term contracts to the esk drhy.
All three hetmnes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are taking the "of the cake", however brought only supply for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than esk drhy, which is not true. We know the price of esk drhy, which were set last week.
So we have something else to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards society student agency, said to Radiournl Janura.
at the same time have the evidence of all regions. According to him have not taken steps in line with European law.
Why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Haek considers this complaint by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Janura, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmnes do so also.
I suppose, on this occasion will demonstrate clearly that Mr Janura manipulated the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false, mentioned Haek.
Janura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
To Radiournl told, that interrupira the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
, that the campaign will be carried out against the corupcin as such.
Janura began the campaign after the regions were agreed with esk drhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the job of approximately 150 billion not convened a aim.
According to Janura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Janura claims to have been threatened by a member of ssd, because of his criticism of transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we leave, we will lose the licences of buses.
was presented as a Member of SSD, I know, what Mr is, I am not going to say his name, said Janura today to Radiournl.
The vaccine Neumococal will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As the first vaccine must be free to families and at the same time voluntary.
However already appear views, that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumococos.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
from January will receive a free vaccine neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who began with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
Last year a quarter of families left voluntarily vaccinate their children against neumococos.
Parents however paid by a dose 1600 kroner and more.
to vaccinate children four doses are needed.
Experts estimate that insurance companies will spend in vaccines 300 to 450 000 kroner annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent across the vaccination of children around 500 000 annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so - called of package.
The pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of the serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Neumococales infections in our country die each year, according to research in the hospitals 28 children not over the age of.
In addition to the Czech Republic the neumcocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine be mandatory?
However at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be mandatory in future.
From January should be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The vaccine would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovsk, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their partnership spreads vaccines neumococales already long ago.
The experts in an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to undertake, mentioned Kalovsk.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against neumococos.
at the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sre.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the society of paediatricians Odborn Spolenost Praktickch Dtskch Lka Cabrnochov, that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they may think about the reduction in the number of doses. "in the situation, when the vaccine costs such so high, relatively understand the political decision to initiating vaccination as voluntary," said Cabrnochov.
The experts expect that from next year more than 80 of young parents leaves vaccinate against neumococos their babies.
The vaccine neumococal is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on the prophylaxis, to save then in treatment, explains Cabrnochov.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
However pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members however were afraid, that insurance companies could "take the money of health insurance".
Doctors they will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that invest in vaccines 40 000 per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochov.
Still them and us
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
at a time when the Swiss voters have sought to ban the construction of minarets and that there is a general warning on the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which in reality are integrating) in one of the most secular societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the last work from the author why the French do not like the veils "(" the French do not like Headcarves "(2006), an elegant study and argued a problem which divided and the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what they are saying politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France which Mr Bowen called Islamic spaces.
He is a good that reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that concern them.
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or in a city (or both)?
Should teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a man not Muslim?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
These issues are seemingly mundane, argues, things of daily life, which concern the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a secular modern society.
Fail to disseminate this argument.
The Conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of the Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
question the extent to which policymakers French (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims have probably more unfair treatment that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have had to make their historic commitments with the secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? after reading this book, one tends to say yes, but not yet. "
The most devastating picture of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking the life that cannot survive in any other way.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in waters recently open, with diplomats, lawyers and now, as a result of this.
In on thin ice "(" on thin ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson as a courageous of 14 years, fighting only with the end of Jerez, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, caught while following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the twentieth century, 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the premises of zoos are still generally a part of the area of the scope of an adult savage. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green algae that grow within the areas without mincing their stripe.

Ellis resorts stories of other writers and historians, and often makes to the threat that hunters presented to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in high - of assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two nations cazadoras where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, after the ice "(after the ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling tale about the science of the Arctic and a look of how can transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
It is not for lack of effort.
The travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century gave evidence for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the Cold War drew a map of the movedizos of ice circulating beneath the masses of ice.
The satellite and the extensive series of probes in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, chorritos of saline water that while freezes.
But since the bear in the surface until the wonders of the Interior, are all doomed once the summer ice of, it believes can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that placed wreaths on the graves of Arlington
PFC. de'angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the national cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like to do the same for me, therefore only treatment to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning for placing wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the company Worcester in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others decided to several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, and his wife Karen make the trip every year in different cities along the way, for events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non - profit organization, Wreaths event across America, which has spread to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 kroner in the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery national Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and the memorial site for the flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
for the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military career.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, said.
It is like visiting a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of the First World War, the Second World War II and the Vietnam War, because they are not so many visits as the new graves, said the said.
The atmosphere was Alegre while children were playing and couples were taken in hand, while wearing the fresh to the Sepulcrales.
Each circular was a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others Rezaron, and families and friends supported each other in the air.
Some read aloud names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the mud, for those whose headstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers enjugaban tears in their eyes in front of the grave of her son.
Handled eight hours since Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"long after my death I want someone can remember."
Cuban officers arrested a contractor of the US government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government to mobile and portable computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the State Department.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for development alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the US interests section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All the so - called counter - revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
The anti government and speeches are considered serious offences.
Cuba has a blogger community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Snchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Snchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can cause probably tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a rapprochement "slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 - would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and the hotel for foreign visitors, and establishment of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Glory Berbena, press officer in the US interests section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, as mobile free, in Cuba is a crime, said Jos Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the human rights watch, which recently published a report on freedoms in Cuba, called "new Castro, Cuba", a reference to the site of Ral Castro as leader of the country, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
Stated that any solution would probably be policy, and that the Cuban government often leads to a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials Desenmaraan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they expect that the case could help unravel an extensive network of recruiters, which moves the Internet in search of young young.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made approving terrorist attacks in the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led to men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, the isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They are considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when the police authorities the arrested.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underlines the critical role of those in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has as main priority try to infiltrate people within Al Qaeda.
The organization acting as guards, not leaving move those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to its potential to have access to American objectives and due to its propaganda value.
But Kohlmann, senior analyst for the Foundation, based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
Has been transformed into a model based much more on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding "action"
on Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here demanding the negotiators who work in the centre of beautiful center of the city, bolder actions to the climate.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day in which little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists have walked the city holding banners in English saying "there is a planet B" and a in spanish declared, "the land says' enough is enough '.
Several famous joined the protest, even the Danish model and Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the home of his mother, made me aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding, said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way any longer.
The police prevented the protesters too the beautiful center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or carrying of pocket knives.
Under Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified by being involved in the climate, some activists with masks and black dresses placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
were in the buildings, he said, adding that began as llamaradas, but which were followed by "a couple of explosions."
Within the Convention Centre, people gathered around television screens to look the way throughout the afternoon.
But the protest not seemed to penetrate the awareness of key officials as its Wei, chief negotiator of China on the climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact on international deliberations, replied in English, "really was not aware of the situation".
Then followed by saying in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is great, I can hear what is happening outside."
He said that depended on the prospect of each define if the motion was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also say that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools in the capital district.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth grade gave strides at a more rapid pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the recent figures from the national assessment of educational progress is the persistent gap in performance between students African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in fourth grade of D.C. during the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers African Americans rose just three points, only to 212.
In fact the difference in performance grew between 2007 and 2009, 53 to 58 points.
The progress of african - americans the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, falling insignificant a statistically, 245.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap that separated and white and black fourth degree in 2003, when it issued the first ENPE in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the district expressed concern last week, since the advances held by the rector Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole according to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non - profit organization that advocates the educational equity in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy by a difference of two or three points, said member of the council the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem. - for accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of the Eaton elementary.
Brown, a critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that secondary schools in the city have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not spending the time or the energy needed for our schools.
Rhee said the district needs to find better ways to address the needs of students.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the system of reading Wilson, addressed to students in the higher grades of primary school and a half, which dominated the fundamentals of reading early in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and in real life, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which is something of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
Only I think we have to continue working to offer the best speeches to those students who are below the level of degree, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlighted the issue of whether Rhee can further increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools - low performance, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here there is a sort of dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, scores of urban.
The solution of the policy is to devote its resources and reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban, she is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access to public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is extending the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next Convention.
To make higher education a more future
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong.
Graciela Rodrguez, 12 years, fell and blinked during a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the Meadows.
The parents of Graciela barely graduated in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, had never set foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and other pupils eighth grade of the group Gettysburg, where the potential costs 38.690 dollars a year, his attitude was less of guests impressed that of enthusiastic students.
Yes! here is where I am! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that had entered the building of science.
Goodness, seriously?, he said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited during his three - three days, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: the question is not whether you to go to university.
The question is what.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants of secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who enter the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" is at the university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the labour force of the country.
Those who look to the - performance say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes can also play a unique role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
children of low - income, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gndara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined to students.
We have to think about providing a network for these children, from the support kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour universities Graciela is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement programmes of preparation, start when students from low incomes are in middle school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent visiting the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, for two auctions which ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in the restoration the oil industry of Iraq, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are having pujado in only two of the 10 sites.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum of oil from Iraq, a centre of online.
It will be a long time before that something more is on offer in Iraq.
concerns security, by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while the American military are withdrawn, probably prevented American oil companies risk more strongly in Iraq, which is the third most important of oil in the world, said analysts.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have labour costs significantly lower and are more prone to take risks because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, empty handed.

The main planner of Al Qaeda been, apparently, murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a US missile attack in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a principal planner of Al Qaeda operations this week, said on Friday the counter - terrorism Americans.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh Al-somal was one of the two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles against his car, near the town of Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American and Pakistani officials sources in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, operated by the CIA in the tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car the impact, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from watching Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "bodies completely wrecked."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two American - officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
It described Somali as a military planner of Al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside of afghanistan - the region.
Was devoted to conspire throughout the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspirativos attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guide senior command of Al Qaeda and resulted in operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of Al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat that we to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death, Somali would be the second leader of Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high - ranking officers.
The pace of attacks by aircraft operated by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a count of the long war journal, a Web site run by a non - profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to a tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly to informants, said the site.
The top UN envoy in Kabul to surrender
The United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long - term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, to cooperate with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, spend only two years in Kabul.
He said that wanted to notify the Secretary
The un general ban ki - moon, so that had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering to Staffan di Mistura, a sueco - italiano citizen who recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and jean - marie guhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested to his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused in September of the President Hamid Karzai in the in the country presidential vote and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was sacked, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already much scepticism regarding the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a high representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
also the leadership of the UN to allow his successor hire more staff in the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limits of their powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
So it is that the rules of the UN enabled me to recruit only one person since May, said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon "significant additional sanctions against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of approximately 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he dismissed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that worries me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian people in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "his people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear programme is not fully respects the recommendations of the UN Security Council and its nuclear inspection body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that it would to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would make a substantial part of its of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided in connection with the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set for Iran a deadline of 31 December to respond to the proposals, before other options, including continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations on Thursday denounced what he called the "unfounded and baseless accusations of, on the part of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers," in order to achieve an appropriate solution, in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, was found in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in the projects in the United States, to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. American officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan regional government of: "their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Do not abandon. "
In a China that ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda that sermoneaban on the fact that the mother earth is too tired to more children and a baby means a grave more. "
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of their city, changed tack suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more of a child, his reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, 31 years, a human resources manager with a child of eight months.
More than 30 years after that was the policy a single child in China, creating two generations of children notoriously Rechonchos, children alone, apodados "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with the six when the policy was effective, according to the division
Demographic of the UN, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 and more of the 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the global average of 20 20%.
The imbalance is worse rich with very educated populations in coastal cities, as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the family planning Commission and Shanghai Municipal population, has said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and a future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the constitution in 1978, the's one - child policy of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples have abortions according to the sex of the foetus, leading to a high innatural proportion varn - Mujer.
in recent years, the demographic officials have gradually its position on the policy of only child.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are children only and in 2007, and many of their hard - line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the research institute of the University, said that the central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, Shanghai became the first city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, posters that families have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be appropriate to have a second child and apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing answer
Although officials of a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that noted a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But as many Chinese, have only medical and life insurance the inadequate provided by the government.
Without a network of social protection, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West sees the policy of only as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant the first child of the couple.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: "the centre of our families and we were accustomed to all of us.
We are not used to care for others and not really want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two careers, middle class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew up watching the fight their parents during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, said.
Even a single child requires long of parents, argued.
A mother has to give at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "have to reshape their apartment, and the strategic" must have a curriculum prepared for the best childcare when the child is 9 months. "
Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, marked so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations, a renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations to carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in a negotiation, which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders come to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does would not talk about how much money from rich to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies recortaran its of coal, and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the document of six pages, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the official UN climate, yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
Sample profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations recortaran collectively their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45%, compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries recortaran emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday was presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The US special United States, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that call for mandatory cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from the major emerging economies, if they are not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States is not going to do an agreement without the major developing countries move forward and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, said that the maximum negotiating climate of United States lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as the world between the industrial and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies as to save the planet, with China and the United States face on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the four most influential countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take more action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to restrain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will be at best a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, with 43 members, produced a preliminary draft Treaty of 24 pages early in the morning of Friday.
Artur runge - metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has "political pressure on the political process," in part because they are now consolidated and require action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the Heads of Government will reach to close a deal.
high - level officials, as the Minister of environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister, fell from the aircraft and ran towards the corridors of the beautiful center, to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to delimit the claims that during the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people in and out of the convention centre, the activists touch the guitarra performances night mockery of the countries that they are selling, and are preliminary proposals of hand in hand rather than via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodrguez, vice - president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh of Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
To 5.13 on Monday morning, a travel Perforar darkness to point out of train that marks a revolution for in Britain.
The first high - speed intercity train the country will reach 225 kmh, when as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, the St Panrcas in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, then the lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first intercity service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the times of business travel be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce emissions of coal, as well as relieve congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still the high - speed lines in Britain.
High speed two (hs2), a company created in January to provide the government a feasibility study, submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the times.
This will provide a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high - speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan out within a radius of 25 metres of a final.
It is also expected to establish three options for a high - speed network wider approach to the north.
Lord Adonis respond in spring.
The favoured option is being proposed is a configuration with, and in which a single line of high - speed reach West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the West from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the north - east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
it seems that this will be the most beneficial, "said a member of the railways.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which not before 2025, would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the little more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network in Europe's fastest.
The initial is designed to withstand trains 400 Mt of length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions of space of the capital, is expected to extend an existing station to conform to the high - speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the station St pancras international or euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that there will not be a final decision until after a general election.
Even if the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
The it would make the trains to stop the rapid the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is viewed as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.

The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to to suffer and to administer their treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors cedars - sina hospital in Los Angeles, where on Monday by an infection, result of a hernia operation discal on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was operated once again the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous speaker.

We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged, declared Camus.
There is talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean - claude camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "travelled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and I was surprised when I was assured that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated twice for hernia, added.

In 2007, also intervened to the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed of a brain haemorrhage.

After several days of silence, Dr. Stphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the speech "was made without any problem" and that the results of the studies were "normal".
The operation "could not provocarhemorragias and portanto, did not need drainage," added.

The association UDF lifts the tone and warns the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the modem () Democratic Movement of Franois Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt by the President of the new centre, Herv Morin, to launch a takeover bid (takeover bid) on the acronym of the former party Giscardista, Intimndole to withdraw all support, on pain of being sued.
Herv Morin publicly announced their intention to regain the acronym UDF, because it considers that Franois Bayrou was not in a position to defend its political heritage after reaching out to the left.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister, whose party is linked to the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of.
As support for its management, received the support of Mr Herv de Charette (former UMP, current) who claims ownership of the UDF, it was the first to register in the National Institute of industrial property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association, controlled by the friends of Franois Bayrou who do not wish to be deprived of, broke the silence to launch a notice to the Minister and the Member intimndolos to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, on pain of legal proceedings.
These last few days, you have made many statements suggesting that they were going to propose to his political movement to restore the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Franois Bayrou and de Sarnez the modem, as Senator Jean Athuis of the centrist alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + focus +, and the slogan + l 'UDF d'aujourd'hui + in its militant material and the home page of its site, argue the signatories of the letter.
As we know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the office of the UDF that the "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as well as of (its) Internet site".
also on Herv de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) marks the legitimate".
to do so, will use the court to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends' chose 'leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as they had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the new centre, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests of the movement founded by Valry Giscard d'estaing.
As for Herv de Charette, continuing the office, "when they saw the trademark", was no longer a member of the UDF for some three years ago, but of the UMP.
advantage of scandalous and the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on their own.
This indiscretion is transformed into crime, before, a mockery of the strategy of: "we believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy made his own name to try to get out of anonymity fraudulently taking a name that is not right".

This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter are over the reins of the cosmetics empire.
But the Court no 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years, was subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of l'oral always refused to undergo such tests, even more in the conditions proposed by the prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday will deliver a report before 10 March 2010 in which shall confirm whether States if Liliane Bettencourt of weakness and over what periods.
I believe that it will accept.
I will speak to her, said Mrs Bettencourt lawyer, Georges Kiejman, to get out of the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Franoise Bettencourt - Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased by the decision of the court.
is excellent news () will show that he (banier) to this lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against franois - marie banier, photographer and artist, has been used for years by the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, who considers a long - standing.

No other person may appear in its place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, marie - chrsitine daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that once made the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of the intelligence of business?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of the intelligence of business will have been in vain
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing: it is that the partners to join "values" certain from above as before it was imposing on consumer products designed for the technical factory.
to put the customer in the heart of the company, the of marketing gave place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the factors of preference for customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly executives.
This demobilization a serious development of all the functions of the company, especially of R & D and, even more, the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the (business intelligence) "demands that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a forward - looking"; it needs by employees a compromise that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we convened a managerial revolution, which would be the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as the customer.
Opinion polls have a relative utility internal
The domestic opinion polls, as the questionnaire by Orange among their employees, to incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, fear not.
In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what always made! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- finally, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As come from large schools of engineers, interpret the psychology mechanistically.
Take, for intellectual comfort, the former theory that the "American" Reactivaron recently, and that the institutes and the media largely behind their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commandos" (sic) of the commitment of the executive, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. Fr reaffirms the managers in a position of management, unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a specific vision of human behavior.
is to integrate into any reasoning or practice of business management, a basic fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly as a means to part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the analysis Motifuncional take this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined Doxa that allows them, through the image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the factors of mobilization, managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate its "social" and relocate the performance management Derecursos human "in the place".
In this way, create a favourable ground for the development of a business intelligence strong and effective.
Oslo speech: the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former Vice - presidential candidate for the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, leading figure of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA today, and added that she had addressed the issue of the war "sometimes necessary" in his memoirs published.
In my opinion, the war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
to stop the terrorists, observed.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done a very good job "in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very well, the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech I found very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program The Takeaway.
The former elected representative, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to listen to "a president of left" when reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to stand as a "citizen of the world", as it always does, "" spoke as an American president "to remind the Europeans" living in a bubble of security that they did not create and not do much to preserve it, "said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the era of Bush, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the Internet site national review online.
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocents, warned.
However, the press centre left praised the president.
Los Angeles time, continues to believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented excited the Californian newspaper.
Obama delivered the speech that was necessary, "the new york times, at the same time of bleak and instructive".
transport: three negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations maratnicas, the industry sector unions of roads and the TLF transport and logistics (France), the only organisation employers who remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
during the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" with the agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators dismissed at the end of the Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement at in the morning.
Even though three employers organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 H was necessary for all agree and the text is firm to 18 H.
The conflict "have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that disrupt the new year celebrations," declared Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (transport).
The rate per hour of euros 9,06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some rogue, added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it is "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high, bearing in mind international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) is recognized as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that a low of 100 million in charges employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the finance bill of correction for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms.
The signing of TLF allows the agreement is implemented, in the event, companies this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, that the Minister of Labour make an extension.
"as soon as possible," will be assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR complained that it was a business naive, "the EUR 100 million" had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax. "
The secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to those who want to eat Turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner, regretted the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.
A: conflicts over the weekend, unions with the proposals of the
The conflicts in the RER, the largest urban public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to their request for premium.

The interconnection with the snfc will be suspended in Nanterre, which will force passengers to change train.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy "the RATP strive to provide service to the large shops."
The to crosses from west to east the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP from saint - germain - en - laye and nanterre until boissy - saint - lger and marne - la - valle.
This Friday, roughly one in two trains at peak hours, and almost no train in hours Valley, as had been planned.
on Thursday there was no disorder in the platforms thanks to the organisation of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, the ALBA, the station - germain - en - () was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In boissy - saint - lger (val - de - marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained that it had lifted "an hour and a half later to reach".
The station saint - lazare not, indicated the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and forces of order.
The RER to which the SNCF from cergy - le - haut or bound for it arrived or the station saint - lazare to join the metres.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Will be analysed the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, a meeting that took place with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who demand a premium due to them, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP puts even in parentheses its proposals premium, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the direction "was not able to resolve a problem that the SNCF and roads had already resolved".
It provides a new meeting is "on Monday to a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession, the RATP.
It also led to the trade unions to say that the company "not for users of the weekend".
in the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters, in Paris.
Then the direction, which refused until then to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to the B on Tuesday, after the unsa and indpendants have submitted a notice.
The unions are for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to 150, of which 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, indpendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers daily.
The drivers, all in the second degree of his career, charge of to 2.7 gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours with alternados, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolving the party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the main party prokurdo of the country, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community in the south - east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which has just lend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.

The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members of Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of the principles of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and by many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political rebels of the PKK.
However, the party claims it has no "organic '" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and called on the government to negotiate with him.
The the court's verdict of at the time the government fallen into a hand to the Kurdish community Proponindole a series of measures to strengthen their rights, for which the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a - could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south - east anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader, Abdullah, degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of south - east populated mostly by Kurds.

After the verdict, stated that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despondency".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) dissolving a party, told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, the minister of energy, Yildiz.
This decision completely completely the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks of recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily Custodiado for the secret weapons.
Today, the community of inhabitants, situated 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Silicon Valley".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the seat of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies of the centre of innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were various mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration."
The vice - alcalde Juri Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In the 2010 travelling to a seminar in Selenogrado representatives FIZ and directors of small and medium - sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences.
Scientific exchange
It is a scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility to put a foot in the Russian market.
To change Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes Russians.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so - called "City of socialist" for research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "green city") received its name from the landscape of mountains, which settled research facilities.
Checks of
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 does not sufficiently high.
For supporters of the project is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which the of the region capital of banden - wrttemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
With terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at the time of the nineteenth century engineering, acting as checks of a modern rail traffic, formerly an enormous amount of time was needed for locomotives back ahead.
Rolling, stopped in their tracks continue the journey; but it should be done.
And why should disappear terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step, which is approximately half of the journey of the trans - European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan of "heart of Europe".
The S21 really will be initiated, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the capitals hessiana and Bavarian is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course also have more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with unity tractora and cart driver at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built towards Ulm will be launched.
Federal and communal have prepared well.
The rail continues, also because the risks of large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic is the taxpayer and not the state.
from the point of view, the project still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, many green areas, probably the graphic generated by computer the designer.
for the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The station step and the road are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
at that time there was the competition from low - cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening the transport of goods, since the rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than those made by lorries on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affect many other projects of.
more than six billion euros should be buried in the.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money in other crossings and passages in the network.
In total sixty 60 projects are on the list of the Ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres long through the valley of the valley.
Since 1987 is the route to a slow.
It is urgent that here the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international carriage of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the autonomous parliament in Wiesbaden, if it going to lodge an appeal to the ruling on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court Hesse.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts legal research of the judgment of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had informed in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway north - west planned at the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged in the federal government, would not be compatible with the legal protection of the population of the noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is going to present the appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the government representatives of for the to appeal to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD, Torsten Schfer - Gmbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises to prohibition of night air traffic, had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of floor.
It is quite difficult, if you leave keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "we keep our word."
The Minister Posch rejected the of schfer - gmbel, that the federal government would be trying through distortions of the right and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition would not act on the basis of a "first impression".
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Mller (FDP).
as well represents the opposition, would not have been of his group about the prohibition air traffic of night.
US banks in the aid.
The big American banks buffeted by the crisis of their state.
"Bank of America" returned once the aid that he had paid the bank rescue fund of a total of 45 million (approximately 30 billion).
and also the group Citi plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the CNBC United States.
With this the institutes are free from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
"Bank of America" had secured about 19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box, which had enough resources, including by the sale of items.
The banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked on Wednesday night especially to American taxpayers: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The group also also aims to get money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported source of known circles, that the American bank could announce already for this Thursday, increased its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the group Citi declined to comment.
In June had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Rapid election
in the end it was faster than was thought.
Barely two weeks after the administrative council of the German television channel ZDF () the head chief of Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely also had no further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schchter, if this proposal is not adopted in the administrative council.
Frey, the candidate of Schchter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The result of the vote was not yet finalised the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schchter failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure to Schchter, but a failure that could be expected.
for the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor - in - of had been organized by the President of the government of Hesse, sr. Roland Koch.
Declined another mandate of the editor - in - chief of prestigious with the argument, under the leadership of Brender news ZDF would have lost audience ratings.
until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which flagel political influence on the ZDF.
The end until had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which described the of Koch as unconstitutional.
But not served.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
Studied politics, pedagogy and Romance.
he worked in the station "Sdwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter".
In 1983 was changed to the ZDF, in principle the "heute - journal."
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 rapporteur staff of the head of chief; correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the programme "Morgenmagazins; until the 2001 director of the foreign policy; since then director of the study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the dismissal of Brender, which was elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the magazine means "Medium Magazin."
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of rhineland - Palatinate, explained last week that the Federated States should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the control was ruled out by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr Peter Frey, recommended to the administrative council with a smart move: criticised heavily the by the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence therefore could Schchter name for the post of head of drafting without losing face, as the administrative council could vote, without falling under suspicion of the post a henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded to the liberal left.
University careers are
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the ministers of education and culture of the Federated States finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions in the cases of bachelors and masters.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: basically each module of the race to finish with a single review.
In addition to examine the workload of students, and it wants to ensure a "real measure and justifiable."
The and universities want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The Federated States commit themselves to establish more flexible rules for careers of bachelor and master.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of education and culture and the presidents of universities talk constantly improving undertake and conclude with a successful career (estudiabilidad).
Now for the first time there was talk of a content.
the so - called accreditation Council agreed to drastically reduce the number of tests: "each module ends with a single consideration," said in a document of 30 pages, which seeks to regulate the adoption of the careers.
With the significant reduction in the burden of examinations "is intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the Estudiabilidad, explained the director of the Accreditation Council, Mr Reinhold.
Moreover, in the future, "estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
The courses.
Students would have the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage its own initiative ".
These rules valdran for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reacreditar" once every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which was installed by the states.
The ministers of education and culture exhortaron the federal states in October influence influence in the agencies, that the amount of raw and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some Lnder universities and technical schools already reached agreement with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only renania - platinada assured provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring programs and student counselling, as well as strengthen offices of examinations and from outside.
The land and the universities seek to have 10 million for these purposes.
at the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to Parliament a novel of university law.
As it should be enough for one consideration for the completion of a model of career.
The shape of the race should be made more flexible, also wants to ensure the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to master.
until the end of next year is intended to examine all careers about their "estudiabilidad".
This Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of study in the federal state.
part of the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
In the board at the federal level of the university groups Juso (Young Socialists) seexiga, that the configuration of the education policy is no longer should be "behind closed doors" of ministers and the university rectors.
at the latest after the strikes of the education, now students as main involved should be able to say.
The president of the board of university (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave its support to students: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers for Education, with which the HRK on a joint document on reform.
For the Union of education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not enough: the Union requires a legal right for each student with the title of bachelor the possibility of access to a career later.
The Federated States have to ensure that the current generation of students of bachelor exist in study places for a future master with the best possible conditions of study. It reported a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have quecontratar significantly more teachers.
But on greater access to the Masters, the ministers of education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Mller
"come and go in Germany is virtually no control," said the first line of a poem by Werner Sllner in fragments of language, in which tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany for a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Sllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as reader in a publisher of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To Sllner gave several prizes for literature, in 1993 the memorable lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since el2002 is director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured their Securitate"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Sllner read out a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service against fellow writers alemanes - rumanos, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
in conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Sllner had received the prize of the German language.
Attempts to recruitment had started slowly, early in 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who is not sufficiently defended against attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate", ended Sllner.
The Werner Sllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Mller and his controversial literary equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, shaking the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors of Romania for a case that exposed the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based in control and espionage.
Werner Sllner is, by what is known so far, is not only a but a victim.
In his dossier of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist literary Michael Markel after the confession of Sllner, and stressed the positive influence for him delIM Walter.
It had apologised or defended at all points difficult for him, said.
"I feel the need to make this statement," he said.
The declaration of Sllner public face in this way and of this was unexpected, the confession of a ex - disidente and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securitate - spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Mller in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", having read his own dossier of pages.
Those involved have surely speculated and will known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the files Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the issues of control by the Securitate is still fairly vague.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather more.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Mller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the condecorada.
"She is psychosis," in the end only once.
The infamy of power seemed to show no rounds in the form of freedom of opinion.
of course, questions arise inevitable with the case Sllner, as so often when there is blame silent.
Why right now? who caused damage? the calm of the listeners off the confession of Sllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this story is more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Mller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, addressed a taxi Mercedes class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the foreign service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very nice of Christmas celebration, in which the manufacturer of sports goods distributed samples.
The man in the feature had hired a driver, because we still do not know the city.
Moreover, it would also have to drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was intoxicated with joy man of 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "it is true that we reached the final of", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, but we can not be blinded by the success: we will have to fight the decline. "

Then, it will be necessary to repeat the success of the real "in the league.

The final of the Champions League (IDA of the 16/17 and 23/24 February / parties back 10 and 17 March) Sortearn in Nyon on 18 December.
So remained limited the joy at the entry of the successor.
not only in the supposed savior, time they had inspired the bewildered profis Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on its strengths, urged to be launched, the of souls Gross explained his recipe for success that simple sounds, but with the therapist had already had an effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, when in football there is a new impetus, sometimes things that had not been thought possible. "
and Sami Khedira, after a pause of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly to become the best player local thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon "with the proverbial wind and the way of work of the new head: he is a man who in depth, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
and that is what has been missing, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the steering Horst Heldt
But the Vfb Stuttgart on record.
As Gross, also the players and the manager abstained from overstate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of relay and totally of guests.
Also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had reached the sad, to think Khedira.
and the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to in his birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which returned to be updated in the form of a television interview, released just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, faced Heldt the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change of coach by the pressure of the fanatics teenagers.
also had removed his day after the games Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
statements of Lehmann were marked by the pure selfishness ", Heldt, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
Probably will no longer be friends forever, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others in that, without previous efforts with the team of coach replaced, would not have been possible the spectacle of great strength of game and battle.
Babbel and their assistants had an important part in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed the man in the suitcase of plastic.
Fight the World Cup of heavyweights
Ardent mourning in Berne: Time and again the Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association wbc expired in the night from Friday to Saturday in Berne the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to make the Noqueo that everyone had hoped.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be overcome because of their injuries.
The Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
a few 17000 spectators in the sand of Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 metres, wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimetres lower, before the mourning had proclaimed the end of the era, was again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisive contribution to its target dangerous.
In general terms, the Johnson did too little for a challenging, and only tried to move the rounds.
While he was to Klitschko with words and gestures, their blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second, after Hoffmann in 2000, 12 rounds complete with Klitschko.
before the fight, the challenging had already been true scandal in the Swiss capital.
Had insulted Klitschko as horrible zombie ", it does not do anything."
The weight, the champion was left on Friday to take Johnson glasses sun of the nose to see their eyes. "
Fourth triumph after the return of
Also at its fourth row after their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, expired at the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered their "belt of the WBC, which previously had to surrender without a fight.
that year, in their defences of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
in this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko their rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after it destron in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company which promotes is planning because the fight against Klitschko in the stadium, London.
The case
Frontal attack the opposition: the head of the group of the Greens, Jrgen Trittin, called liar the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, due to false information on the subject.
The SPD and the Left require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence, karl - theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), have with knowledge of the facts.
in the news "'" on Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the group of the Greens, Jrgen Trittin, said that the minister had not told the truth "about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
in such a case, usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have given without taking into account the rules of the international force protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that had NATO, and read the Gutenberg, said Trittin.

The Greens, the SPD and the left Exhortaron on Saturday the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the federal government, and if the chancellery, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, demanded Jrgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Knast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The chancellery not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.

Officially it was said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and had concealed details sensitive to the minister.
However, since the environment of the two senior officials, it transpired that they even had to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a patrol of the area.

Worlds onricos
in a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are acostados in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can without hindrance to the most wild imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, who States similar to the dream during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, is considered the most modern in the Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as manitico.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in.
The blame with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make blurring the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness onricamente modified warning may appear in the most diverse forms, in the best we call visions, and at worst madness.
Although it can distinguish the trigger and effects, it can refer to similar such visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, experiences psicodlicas of the prophet of the new era Carlos Castaeda, states of possession chamnica, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
hallucinations or delusions arise when it has descarrillado the balance of the neural substances of communication in the brain especially the dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetilcolina and is clouded the interaction between different parts of the same.
during a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear hallucinations complex and thoughts.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with States onricos" to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the absurdities, formations Alocadas, and mirages of it".
is the autumn of 2001, when T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, deformed, rechinando teeth.
We are pursuing, with heavy boots and Flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices shrill and malignant ringing from the walls and the radio.
can no longer, the voices that insult and offend.
T. two cables from the stereo, the amarra to form a knot of hanged, and fixed in a hook in the ceiling.
You climb in a bocina and puts the noose around the neck.
Plain.
The rope was.
What you will serve as a lesson!, the voices in a chorus that the tmpanos, sees the clinic and do you! "
Now, T. is 40 years and has undergone six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of death was LSD.
His diagnosis is psychosis esquizo - afectiva - paranoide, is also maniaco - depresivo, takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
has learned to live with his illness, three years is married.
in the psychosis have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, says.
hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics treated as the second most common disease after the depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of sobreexcitacin that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disruptions in the relationship, or mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, or.
They are also frequent optical hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signs, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deep layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, said Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
at the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, is overwhelmed by events and cannot organise actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, the impossible.
Having experienced a alucinacin once in life
Unlike in a dream, said Fuchs, "the spatial structure and sensory reality that perceived in the psychosis remain in principle as it."
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown why our brains for mishaps.
According to the states of exception can lead to any person to lose touch with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but studies studies have shown that in addition to the genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage.
We suspect that the maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system, which manifests itself in all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role stress or a traumatic experience can be a psychosis when there is already a provision.
Similarly, the drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the system transmitter in the brain.
When the brain warms
What all this is that people Psicticas suffer with their hallucinations and take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor in psychology Erich Kasten, of Lbeck.
The perceive a alucinacin as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten collects from ten years ago reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the irreale Die Welt in unserem (the world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, together with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as tablet, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and injuries.
So surprising and under certain conditions, the of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that normally are repressed.
Arise when the brain areas of the processed perceptions are hiperactivas or are little; when our brains are hot, but also when there is a lack incentives.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of brain or other states of exception.
In jngeren studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years, lived in a small town of Western Pomerania and a to a secondary school.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
Sometimes, the recess, happens that a clumsy boy with long hair and dark led the floor.
When she replied, the other pupils the soprendidos; one, part of it, hear or see the boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoadora a little strange, but Sarah K. knows that it is not dreaming.
is awake and sees and hears that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank.
Can feel even their presence, at least some moments.
It is a pleasant, likes the boy.
Sometimes wonders whether it is crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
Nightly, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When in class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because Professor their eyes and ears is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest explains so visible and audible the mathematical equations.
Nightly, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often arrives late and is scarce, is not able to tell whether aroused or dreaming, if the images we see, the nose or the girl with cuts in arms and legs, appear with their eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, shouts to the figures.
Their parents and friends told you nothing, that is insane.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. has hoy20 years.
Adopted last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has come in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that he is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is Yse charged the same sought entertainment.
Sarah K., daughter only, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, learned that the man called Daddy since has use of the reason is not his biological father.
Since the noise and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process impressions real and noise, those affected as Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. every experience, "says Kasten, takes place in the brain, the reality is planned there.
hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, therefore seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies the night fantasies as a form of alucinacin.
hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation between dream and alucinacin
In this world too focused on what aware, the experiences often to generally patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and medical clinic head of psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence - Nightingale - krankenhauses in Dsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful but that also involves something positive and creative the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard has investigated the so - called oneirismo, a special form of awareness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The Onricas hallucinations are almost dreams very detailed and complex that the person experiencing considers real and subsequently cannot differentiate of being awake.
The states aware onricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or illness, as for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropata, experiencing a paralysis remain completely aware. Die EIB vollem Bewusstsein motorische Lhmung erleben.
According to schmidt - degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or in the world due to an inability total and permanent, it replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world of their own and that is decoupled from reality.
A form of extreme situation between dream and.
since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation present in the imagination.
An intensive to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in that our own capacity capacity allows us not sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zurich, described their experiences onricas in his book Herzenwechsel as a rescue of the soul.
Had 49 years, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after an operation of the heart valves with of heart included, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the intensive care.
Claussen descended into a world created by the same and visited places strangers in other times: was lying in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot for their health.
was in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by noble who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike was kidnapped in their country of origin, made on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow Firn and was found with a Korean.
What gives all these facts imaginary, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
dream is a different state, describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips are mental, many years later, much more clear, even in the details irrelevant.
more intensive clear and even that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of the rest of our everyday experience, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile the internal reproduction of the reality outside, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of conscience, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Crude
The children take charge of the editorial with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave your company in the future in the hands of his two sons, commented to Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg the publisher Hubert gross sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have committed to enter the company, confirmed gross, 69 years, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are able to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not adequately trained for this.
that would with the children and also with the company.
Crude released on Thursday that he will withdraw from January the presidency of the board and that paul - bernhard kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, 52 is since 1999 member of the direction of crude.
Initially was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and with it came the responsibility on the heritage of the company. Following the departure of Jrgen Todenhfer also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
for the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the publisher.
The children of crude have 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge the differences of 10, 15 years," according to gross.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Gross said that family businesses are not immune to the decline: "this has always affected families are transmitted by the lure of search for capital, which have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur," says gross.
I do not see it as a politician in this country, as it was, and I do not want to play with the time in the world league; these businesses have become too great.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, without even to see some kind of Deputy or surf the net.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a monthly quota very low, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the plan of data visualization.
Given the success the company has brought two new devices: one exclusively designed to Twitter, the other with a free service of data for life in exchange for pay six times more for the peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the event web, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnacinn.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, around 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a cafeteria with WiFi (or a FON) to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming to fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated ear pulling of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
A aparatito as FonPeek (it is curious that bear the name of fon when lacks WiFi) of charges mean that operators are starting to think differently and studying different proposals with which their data network.
Kindle is another good example, includes trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and bagpipes.
It is a connected device and paid for it to buy it, not month to month.
and that is what I hope to see one day with Fonpeek, an option to purchase with access for life as Peek already has in us.
Not because I will buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I believe that it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The colour fetish of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the tone of the American first lady.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a clothing and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has led a model very similar in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar colour - yellow verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts - vestido, jacket and shelter of the same tela -, and adornaba with a large embroidery or collar.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the question which are the two suits makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
supplements have also changed: shoes the green shoes Tacn last time, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
And equally different is the hair: a included on this occasion, throwing the previous one.
75% of working mothers has had problems for maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in the younger generations who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study 'fertility and trajectory of women in Spain', produced by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers saw limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation of couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, working part time, or have a stable work, initiated before the of couples, the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, the coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"women between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after the cohabitation of, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time record vital to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work played exerts great influence on motherhood although less about the timing of the pairing, "explains the researcher researcher the Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that the age for women to marry and to have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the education level, the greater the age at marriage and have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, which have studies elementary and higher were mothers for the first time to the middle and of average respectively.
"There is another division between women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary school marry and have their first child before getting a stable, the levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to ensuring a stable employment as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "detailed Delgado.
Diane Kruger also applies
Paris just add a new name to its list of: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become image of various products of the brand, the universal slogan of 'because I'.
The protagonist of "Joyeux Nol ', one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, joins a number of other famous recruits of l'oral Paris, as Linda evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie, Eva Longoria and the Penelope Cruz.
Before that, the last to join such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In paragraph male, the cosmetics brand also has ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline colleague in 'lost').
awards the British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - diseadores and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, held in London, the Royal Court justice.
No one was missing to quote.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia may Jagger, elected best model of the year.
poker of Manuel
Manuel given away in 'poker of ace' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty X - rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in the foreseeable and fearsome (Biogrfica, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the character creator.
The trip has its excitaciones and not saves scares or iluminaciones.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and relecturas.
Here I leave some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "in its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without giving name: the pleasure against the destination, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian, wrote what was in the blood, not the intellect, between the powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic, pointless, as the roadmap of the knife that was about to kill."
On Graham Greene: "our man was abducido by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, in whose meat Conjug the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach the sky through the path of doom."
James Joyce on: "the 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the tops of eight thousand metres of the universal literature, to be by the north wall, from which despean again and again the best alpinistas."
On William Faulkner: "was a rare.
In itself, sometimes said that was the heir of a landowner of the county and others was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both were dreams of greatness. "
On louis - ferdinand cline: "this writer took up the cry insane launched from a bridge in Munich to carry its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did so in a trip fleeing itself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "one day brought to its knees and rez: 'God, you ask you to stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "on his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'the dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life extremely pleased to death."
On Virginia Wolf: "in the luggage also their depressions.
The husband accepted quite normal that she told that Eduardo VII The between the azaleas or that the birds sing in Greek.
has never been the case of a man as patient and lover of a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness. "
On Pius Baroja: "What did martn - santos but try to inoculate to Joyce in Baroja?
What tried Benet but move to Baroja by weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela but abducir the reputation of that man to serve as own pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed along to her and our dog, a copy of race, rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, you two kicks that left the dog Malherido.
Our indignation is glaring because we not the fun in a wanton aggression to a small animal and defenceless, which incidentally, was tied.
Add to this the suffocating that led to a lady who was passing by quietly and that, when these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a energmeno that attacks an animal, is able to do so with a woman, a child, an elderly or, in short, with whatever weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday either by a traditionally quiet.
The dog was crying all day.

Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the hull
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the hull, mainly among young motorcyclists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond design and manufacture products every day more secure" and said that also contributes to this goal through other actions of educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of hull in the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be', will have a first phase in which will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles, with the goal of maximum dissemination.

The sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not osbtante, it should be put in quarantine because the reference to the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% drop over the previous year.
consequence of this is that, despite the resurgence of the last month, the accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January have been sold 95.853 units together all vehicles that make up the hotchpotch of the commercial light: derived from cars, pick up, trucks, vans and trucks / chassis chassis.
Also, have not disappeared the clouds that most affect their demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium - sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
closed so that the restrictions in the tap of bank loans, to other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background and unlike cars, have been of little help aid to the purchase of the 2000E.
To them eligible, in addition to individuals, the self - employed and SMEs that not to acquire a commercial slight of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been.
Yesterday, since Ganvam returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (lorries and buses).

The emergency brake is already mandatory
As happened with the anti - blockade of brakes ABS and about the stability control ESP systems brake assist systems will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of registration, while the rest is set for a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while on his way to work, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The assistant to the emergency brake it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects the pisotn that gives the driver.
But this does not always maintains that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, the third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use any force.
To 1.1 accidents
the aid, however, requires the maximum the brake system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one of every four claims with damage to people - when popularicen so - called intelligent emergency brake system.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, will help increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If we do not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the brakes maximum effort to minimize the damage.

At the wheel of the
For desarrolar his last, and expensive jewel, the engineers of Porsche Boxster S as basis and that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kg, which has left the bscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to dispense, firstly, automatic roof has been for one with manual, thereby 21 kilos; using doors of aluminum as the 3, 'fall' other 15; taking away the climatizador, 13; reducing fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres, won 7 more; sports Bacquets other 12 and with the light of 19 inches, five.
Finally, to renounce the audio system CDR - 30 other six kilograms and changing the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
It also offers with change of double, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads of California, in sections of mountain with routes really revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
Reducing weight does not mean that the car not the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: not long testbamos a model so small and light that, in turn, transmit such security in the curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time, until he ordenemos that esprinte, which slow, to recover and return to squeeze its engine...
What I ask. thanks to your leadership, as forthcoming as accurate, what we share with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
and it will do so with a surgical precision.
Sound of the engine will
The sound of a V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digiri the potholes.
Electronic aid barely did presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves are ice at dawn and gravilla, already well into the morning.
In short, a car, the more fun to drive that one can in the market and that is something more than a simple amendment of the Boxster
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavs opted for the game Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to that outside his home, to further expand its advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic already started to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, while the 'least six' assessment of splitter already did expectation that this was going to be the best night of Brazilian.

The team Malagueo not by the environment of the flag of peace and friendship and not by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed to dream of the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive, two of the basis Omar Cook and one of Guillem, to the local, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the premises in the with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave the return to the scoreboard 22-20, minute 13, at which an action, of, between the two American bases and Williams, was the disqualification of both players.

The Brazilian government has since run the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will have must leave the diplomatic Legacin later than 27 January 2010, when officially mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charg d'affaires of Brazil's embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where a refugee from 21 September.

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring in the inflation of assets has been the dominant pattern in the markets, new uncertainty to reappear in the markets, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the actors take decisions on the future uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to the markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and, without questioning its policy of liquidity, begin to throw some sand in the wheels how did the ECB with its auction to year of next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without measures as heterodox and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned to rally, although still far from the levels that reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socializing risk private and public debt becomes to be affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an extension of the spreads the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had been affected by this episode of instability but in that Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence defenders of the moral hazard that trying again to create awareness on those responsible for the global economic policy for braking the destructive effects of the restriction on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to introduce a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai it in a tribal struggle between the emirs to reshape the power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that public deficit, elections and a new government that is pulling the blanket.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duro Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin salvase Hungary of a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that will allow a member country of the euro to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and responsible to its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, how we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expectations.
in the case of Spain, while our public debt spreads extended like the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European diminish differentials and our continued to expand, then it would be risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate their scenarios of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur very life expectancy to his warning.
Again, is the pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spain, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver."

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Snchez Galn, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the debate these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by the President of gas natural - fenosa, rafael villaseca, gave the press a few of what had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and other 60 million between that date and 2030, provided they are kept open nuclear power plants in operation today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be of 60 billion, but up to 95 million.
yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in a generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue is changing and it will have to increase the power.
Its bid focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture and, above all, of renewable energies.

Galn, which considers that the draft law on sustainable economy that has just adopted by the government is in line with what his company has been calling for, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear commitment to the long term" in this sense, despite the measures "targeted", as the president of Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, believes that investment decisions, although in the long term, it must begin to take because it takes to mature and a stable framework is needed to address them.

Play the champions has brought 476,4 million to Madrid and the since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.
Therefore, that real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, that makes them the third and fifth club that more money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the season, according to data from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have gone well from this distribution.
The club has been the third of the continent that more money has been pocketed by participating, and the only, along with AC Milan, which has won the trophy three times.

Moreover, Spain is only the third country that has made more money through the champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, four from Italy, the three of England and Germany's two).

There are also bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and Empatar (400,000 for each team). The octavofinalistas will receive three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four embolsarn 4 million each.
The champion won 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the intervention.
Thus, in the concept of fixed payments, a club at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
the on the other hand, 2.5 million by winning the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But it is also are variable payments, which are targeted 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is the main, and four seats allocated.
The the previous year falls champion of with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the quarter.
