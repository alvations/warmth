What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, nor the "pastry shop."
The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the ČSSD will have to overcome obviously certain linguistic barriers to be able to understand her old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague advice and in the town representation generally.
The newspaper Aktuáln ě. cz has "knocked off" members of the new advice from the ČSSD sometimes a little as they control the notorious slang which has become naturalized during the last years in which the today's coalition partners were in Prague in the oar.
The coding vocabulary which was introduced in the ex-era by chief burgomaster Pavel Bém of the Prague political élite is borrowed from some of the best known actors, situations and Causae.
Astonishing proofs appeared that the new councils grope about concerning these new concepts something in the darkness.
They maintain this at least.
"Wer ist Voldemort?"
"No notion."
"I am rather a novice in the Prague politics," reacted Luká š Kauck ý, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "godfather's vocabulary."
But also councillor Karel Březina - a political ex-serviceman - reacted in similar manner.
For example, on the concept "Gulf hole."
"This is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use every now and then."
"Otherwise I do not hold a lot from slang."
From the vocabulary, the daily paper Aktuáln ě. cz had published in this year's June before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff pecked out six concepts, above all those which are connected notoriously with the Prague City Council.
The social democrats should go the concepts "Voldemort," "the biggest Prague gulf hole," "to the pastry shop" define "bull nape," "betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín wagonbuilder, the future boss of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, then did not answer, however, sometimes the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start.
"These things make no difference to me and how the middle-class democrats talk together, about that I do not judge."
"For me is important as we get on within the scope of our programmes," he countered.
As already intimated, Luká š Kauck ý would not have recognised in the headline mentioned on top supposedly that from the high-powered enterpriser and friend of the ex-chief burgomaster Bém, Roman Janou š ek the speech is.
The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky purely nothing at all and the only concept which he guessed with the test correctly, was "the biggest Prague gulf hole."
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck ý, still, however, added to the security: "But I know this rather from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will have to book a linguistic course."
Then the "gulf hole" is deciphered not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Luká š Plach ý properly as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both social democrats also know for whom the concept Voldemort stands and Luká š Plach ý anticipates even where this figure is to be found and thereby also, what it means, "to the pastry shop to go."
"I believe to go that is to any Prague catering trade company," Plach ý is quite near in it in the riddle solution if one knows that it concerns, on this occasion, the seat of Janou š eks companies.
However, agree with Březina he protests to have scooped this knowledge rather from the newspaper, as that this vocabulary would be own to him.
To judge by the test participants, there seems to be among the social democrats really no similarly established slang.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is not such a thing with us really."
"We calls us with the name, every now and then we also use abbreviation or nickname," says the chairperson of the Prague Petr ÈSSD Hulínsk ý - from his party members casually "Hulda" called.
"At school I was called Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether me also my colleagues call so," Karel Březina betrays to us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln ě. cz has tried out the name and see there - he functions.
Councillor Weinert is for the party members friendly the "grandpa" or less friendly the "old person," the representative Miroslav Poche who drew the attention before the elections by machination with the party sponsorship to himself, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only one which the social democrats admit in the inner-party usage.
Hulínsk ý does not like it supposedly if one calls him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln ě. cz registered one more nickname of the Prague chairperson.
His nickname "doctor of the truncheon rights" deals supposedly with the fact that Petr Hulínsk ý his title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of "witches" and published a pamphlet
The women who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witches show as a rule some common social signs.
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes" the witch, it is strictly isolated, so that she cannot become dangerous for the rest of the village.
"Men are concerned by this destiny rather seldom."
"Also have young and healthy women this remains saved, because they help at the work and bear children," a sister describes the situation which looks in the capital of the West-African state Burkina Faso at a special home after more than 100 women who were expelled by her communities.
Now the local government resolved to go forward against this unusual "social measure."
And if a pamphlet which should prevent the "witch's pursuit" gave change that's why.
However, the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out to the dilemma of the written clarification.
However, of the witchcraft is to be accused also in other African countries quite usual ones.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, it was tormented the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová by three women and two men to death - they poured over them with paraffin and simply lighted them.
About this incident the server reported among other things also BBC.
However, the culprits stated, the thing would have been only one meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to your version the oil which is used to ritual Salbungen would be roused.
Namely, after the group has tried "to drive out" "a bad mind" from the woman.
The people support the isolation of "witches" here without taking into consideration her education.
"The standard" cited moreover a 42-year-old enterpriser from Burkina Faso: "Gluttons of human souls are former like today a danger," he said.
While the government tries in Burkina Faso at least to defuse the witch-hunt, the gambianische president has been involved last year the president substantially.
"President Yahya Jammeh kindled after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch-hunt, because these had supposedly portion in their deaths and would try now to kill also the president even by black magic."
"He shouted to it shaman from close Guinea for help, in company of policemen, soldiers and the body guard of the president at random arrested women and men by force from gambianischen villages kidnapped and brought on the farm of the president in Kanilai," the organisation amnesty stated Internationally in her report.
On the farm the incarcerated people were made drink an Absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect which caused, however, also intestinal problems and nephritic problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only on account of the international pressure nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: Though he heats in the stove - nevertheless, pays higher rent
An older stocky man leaves just the client's centre of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the biggest private owner of flats in Czechia.
Under the arm a briefcase with three new hire contracts to three flats: for the own and the flats of his daughters and his son who serves just a prison sentence.
To all three just the rent was raised within the scope of the so-called "deregulation."
Instead of from 3500 crowns of month rent the son should fork out 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room flat with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not in the flat sometimes fluently warm water and must heat one in an easy coal stove," he taps angry with the finger on the new hire contract of the son for whose signing he has an authority.
"But what - I have signed" he explains half annoyed and half resigns.
The civil union BytyOKD.cz which called the new rent terms as "incorrectly and immorally" advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts simply and to wait up to the 7th of December in which she thinks to publish instructions as one goes forward against such contracts.
But the man only declines.
"One says this, the other this," makes he a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes thus the big "deregulation lab."
After New Year this deregulation approaches most flats in Czechia whose tenants pay up to now no rent in line with market requirements.
Aktuáln ě. hence, cz decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is crammed full one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Immediately beside the door there stand the bodyguards of a security agency and with her a call device.
"Rent 2011," so there shines a special field Tast on the touchscreen.
Briefly tapped and already the device spits out a number slip of paper.
Hardly we have deciphered the number "157" and already it cheeps on the big display in the cover of the waiting room.
Half a second later one is in the row.
A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but apparently the rush in the waiting room is not valid at all for the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance problems and the similar.
From the middle of November flutter in the region of Ostrava the envelope with the new hire contracts to most tenants of a total of 44,000 flats of the port folio of the RPG in the mailboxes.
A rent rise of approx. 15 to 38 percent suggests the RPG Byty to them in the writings.
The special counter for the new rents in the client's centre is opened since the 18th of November.
"The action runs something more than one week, that is this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter after one moment hesitation when the "client" turns out journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner's flats are an explosive subject.
Before the elections the parliament vice president Lubomír Zaorálek coming from Ostrava of the ČSSD had taken up this subject quite at the top of the voice, no miracle that today the newspapers are fully of it.
"Twenty years I want from them a new floor."
"Not sometimes besch. They could exchange WC glasses," the at the beginning mentioned man air comes along.
Till present stand in a queue according to the employees before all pensioner in the counter to convince itself whether they receive the promised tenant's moderation really which promises to them RPG if they sign the special offer on time.
The other tenants who sign the new hire contract up to the 15th of December should also come to the pleasure of a February rent reduced half of it.
Till present, however, "deregulation counter" in Havířov is all other, than overloaded from inquiries.
"From yesterday's 360 clients from only about 40 to 50 of the rent were in 2011 because of here," estimate the counter officers.
Besides, RPG offers on her web pages, as well as chalkboards individual rent arrangements where it seems necessary.
Should the rent parties not agree, however, on the new rent, it is fixed by an independent court.
"This should be no threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and absolutely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on his web pages.
"Here nobody goes in court," believes one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client's centre agrees with her at least partially.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) of pension, of it 5,000 are left to me for food where I should get the money for a court quarrel," he believes.
Then, nevertheless, the employee becomes unsafe.
"Time see."
"Mr. Zaorálek says them about the media, they should not sign and thus the people still wait," she points out.
The adjusted rent ends in the biggest part of Czechia at New Year in 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent rise is an economic need.
"The existing height of the rents is not sufficient sometimes to the maintenance of the residential fund," Pavel Klime š argues, the manager of the flat sport folio of the society RPG Byty and - just the disregard criticised by the angry tenants of the flat fund is according to opinion of the house-owners the principal reason for the rent rise.
While RPG could invest four milliards in the flats during the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents, during four years from 2011 to 2014 these should be 5.2 milliards.
On the large-size LCD display in the cover compared with the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov some red shining information appears occasionally over and over again.
"The rent rises in 2011 about 15% and less concern 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of the flats by RPG."
"Always means these at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 flats from the port folio of RPG the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the rise of extremely low rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
With 2600 flats the rent remains next year on the same height.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation forces up the rents not by leaps and bounds, but gradually occurs within four and eight years.
What imposes more - the enterprise on itself an other obligation: The enterprise wants to put all income from the rent rise (see diagramme) again in the flats, above all in warm savings - in new windows and in the heat insulation.
But - with priority these should be of benefit for those people who sign the arrangements about the rent rise.
The architects saw - a kindergarten also belongs to the office
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the enterprise Arch. Design.
But who would expect here already a minikindergarten, with all what belongs to it: to colorful walls, creative pieces of furniture, an amount of toys and even a miniplayground on the outside terrace.
This kindergarten stands since the last year to the employees of Arch. Design at the possession.
The project engineering and architecture office Arch. The design from whose studio a whole series of famous Brünner constructions come calculated from the first draughts for the new building Avriopoint in on the rooms for his companies-minikindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are at the baby boom age and the company is due to the fact that the Projektantinnen and architects return as fast as possible to her job.
Together with the possibility to work shortened the kindergarten is another bonus, which Arch. Design his employee in the draught of her social programme has to offer.
The structural engineers and structural engineer's architects have to bring it so lighter, her demanding occupation and the child care under a hat.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees (inside) from Arch. Design and with the support of the management succeeded to them in winning conveyor money of the European Union and the ministry of work and social for her project.
The operational minikindergarten is financed by the operation programme Human resources and Employment policy from means of the European social fund and from the state budget of Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies at the rate of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years is provided for certified staff and the company.
After the exhaustion of the conveyor means (2 years) is the society Arch. Design obliges to pursue the minikindergarten 3 other years at own expenses further.
The preparation of this project took up a whole year and the society of Economy provided to rating by the application winding up vigorous assistance.
Certified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher looks after the children whole-active, children can visit the kindergarten without restrictions concerning age, although most from them are more than three years old.
And because it is, on this occasion, about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, indeed, alternate the day about several children mutually.
The kindergarten company is tuned adaptably to the need of the parents, the children of all employees have concerning the use of the kindergarten the same rights - without taking into consideration the company hierarchy and her respective position.
Although it concerns individual education and care, the program contents are in the mini-kindergarten still comparably with the supporting programme of the preschool education.
The children play here not only, above all excellent lessons are offered them - from basic knowledge up to the preschool lessons, besides, they still learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative plays, but also with a calculator which is available to the children.
What contributes more - the presence of small children in the company to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can throw any time a look at the children and thus the stress is cancelled with late fetching of the children from a far away kindergarten.
Therefore, the parents use her working hours more productively.
No miracle that here also natural and loyal employer's employee's relations develop.
Arch. Design joined thus under the Czech companies who offer with the recruitment of new employees clear Benefits which are family-friendly and encourage by such programmes her staff marketing.
An osseous house still fascinates after 100 years. Look the Interieure of fun
The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stair like the backbone of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio fun in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house by his organic forms got the nickname "osseous house."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and Mosaiks, the facades reminding in scales and omnipresent soft lines, all this are typical signs for the Jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, affectionate colours and textures which remind of nature and living being.
Only on looking more carefully one notes that everything is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night the whole facade still looks even more sculptural, more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung increasingly the shine of the colours.
The same lively lines and winding forms also control the inside of the house.
Wave-like formed wood copies the window frames, railings, ornamental elements of doors, even peepholes and strips.
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 originated from the rebuilding of a house from 1877 which explained architects Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took up two years and was concluded in 1906.
The investor, the well-to-do industrial Josep Batlló, existed originally on the demolition of the old one and the construction of an absolutely new building, but at last he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper rebuilding.
The block of flats Casa Batlló sketched Antoni Gaudí, nevertheless, not only.
Besides, he worked together with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on his drawing board the decorations originated for the representative flat of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics in the facade was his idea.
Nevertheless, in the creation of the facade co-operated also numerous other Bildner and artists.
The common work on the draughts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus house Casa Milá took part Jujol also in the construction of Gaudís in the park Güell in which also other works of Antoni Gaudí are.
Already shortly after his completion the house of the local inhabitants of his organic forms agreed because of the nickname "osseous house."
Other called it again of the special aperture mechanism because of the "yawning house."
One also says, completely on top on the building is the sword of holy Georg, shown the patron of Catalonia.
But also other bildhauerische elements symbolise concealed religious motives.
Gaudí sketched a central heating system unique for the past with ventilation canals and typical chimneys for the house.
A little bit weirdly her 45-degree inclination already seems.
With his creating ignored Gaudí strictly all construction specifications at that time and can be disconcerted by no means by these.
Though before start of construction work he caught up from the town the suitable planning permission, however, the information provided by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the town fathers were shocked by the result two years later with the completion so that they required remedy.
Among the rest, the councillors also knocked themselves against the fact that the construction with his pillars intervened even in the public sidewalk.
However, for changes it did not come any more, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the relevant request of the town quarter Josep Batlló made an application to the approval of the renting of both höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and it was promptly given to him.
The house-owner himself entered in the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a society drawing room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat.
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller.
The whole 6-storied building goes through a stair to up to the roof terrace.
All right corners and straight lines were removed by the basic elements of the rebuilding and were substituted with crooked and curved walls.
However, Gaudí also worked with a modern draught to the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part joins by opening the drawing room doors completely and thus a bigger society could chat comfortably without having to renounce in more confidential talks a certain intimacy.
The house received by Gaudís rebuilding except a new facade also a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressive it is also Gaudís play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is dressed up and the patios.
The play of these both colours lends a maximum to light to all floors of the house.
Besides, he simply made to himself the principle benefit that white reflects the light better, than dark colours which absorb the sunlight on the contrary in addition.
Today the house Casa Batlló which was taken up in 2005 in the world heritage list of the Unesco can visit each.
On the first floor the most spacious and most splendid flat of the public is made accessible.
The house-owners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When one found out that this is a surely profitable business, one maintained the inspections, one expanded them also on other common ones and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to the inspection of the historic architectural monument is no cardboard handle, he amounts to 16.50 euros, to students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist identity cards got 20 percent of reduction.
This amount excels the entry prices for other Gaudí constructions in the town.
Who would like to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon's turrets, should try to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other wishes than men
Not of the most great bed frames, but the quality of the couch surface - mattress and rust put out the good bed.
However, these must be complementary harmoniously to do justice to the wishes of the concrete user.
With the choice many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least also the gender of the Schläfers.
The interior in which mattress and rust have to submit is as important also.
Typical example?
In a country house in which is heated not regularly latex mattresses are not well suitable, because they need much longer to become warm "."
In addition, they are clearly heavy as usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough little ventilation canals in the core because and lie on top of that on a firm record, humidity accumulates: It is not excluded that forms under her mould.
With a choice of a role also plays of course to what one is accustomed.
Who was a longer time abroad where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual, will hard be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Probably all ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained with me that they cannot properly sleep here any more."
"For her abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer from Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend this, among the rest, also to diabetic people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can badly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková which specialises in upholstered furniture.
Therefore, I have already procured years ago for many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no more problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And one must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey player to come to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" quite simply functions, actually.
The foam optimalisiert his hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, in other words, he properly nestlles up in the warm body.
It nowhere presses, at night one does not roll himself like after a heavy fight.
One simply sleeps much better.
In addition, the viskoelastische foam also offers protection from Dekubitus (gangrene).
With a choice of the mattress size one should include to the body height still the length of the soles, so approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman who are 180 cm to them need thus a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
At least 90-cm couch width should be available to each of the Schläfer, together 180 cm.
By single beds, for example, by singles, 120 to 140 cm are right.
Of the comfort half and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: "If one lies on the back, still enough place should be for the slightly bent arms," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, the guild master craftswoman of the upholsterers and interior decorators who devotes herself quite for years to the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of pieces of furniture and reports this subject also on technical schools.
By a double bed every one own rust and his own mattress needs, but pay attention with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equally high.
Otherwise nothing else is left, than to mount the grates by different height and this is not possible long ago with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of it should be cancelled at least three centimetres to the form layer and the fine upholsterer.
"With the hand or while putting one may feel the feathers by no means," warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a special rust type.
Whole-upholstered beds with mattress and base like grown together Siam twins have to search in the bedroom nothing.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and one cannot wash the relation what is quite quite usual today.
And because one loses at one single night between from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, is clear that the mattress becomes after from five to seven years slowly gigantic (and congested sieve).
Also so the experts reject advertising slogans who promise with mattresses a life span from up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee.
Every thing has to her If and, However.
And, therefore, a practical advice of the traders: With mattresses of 120-or 140-cm width one should not avoid the hygiene of the washable, drawable off relations, still it is advisable to use a mattress schooner which one can easily draw off and wash.
Even if today as a rule mattress relations with all-round zipper are produced, so that one gets two halves (immensely importantly for the washing process and the washing machine size after opening!), the manipulation with bigger mattresses, above all only explained, often like the unequal fight seems between David and Goliath.
Do they have in the bed instead of a rust a firm record?
Out with it!
Or at most for a bed for unbeloved guests and for one single night.
Also so they should provide the record rather with airing holes (provided that already none is in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15-cm least with sucked. Pocket feather core and fine upholsterer use.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For not adjustable duckboards with from 14 to 18 feather strips (lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut palm) are likely, always pay to themselves, besides, grates with a bigger slatted number, so from 28 and more feather strips, with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to adjust the slatted hardness.
On adjustable lamella grates belong no mattresses with feather skeleton, because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
Beside the setting the stiff of the feather strips special adaptable shoulder modules are also offered.
On this occasion, it is about a special connection of the feather strips which enables to push in the feather strips or so very to verwinkeln that they allow selective sinking of the shoulder of the Schläfers.
In particular for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There is even mattress manufacturer who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area with "man's mattresses."
Also to the ladies is intended - one grants to them these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers are point-elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic Kontakt-Pads with sucked. Multitorsionsfederung determines.
The pressure is distributed to several points by which the tension decreases.
But - if one uses pillow to the right mattress and right rust bad (to big and corpulent), most advantages get lost again.
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, his points should reach only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Hence, ideally appears a 50 x 60 cm cushion how it, for example, the Scandinavians may.
In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something have with former (with hay full) to straw bags, nevertheless, commonly.
Modern manufacturers use more and more often natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses the new magic word "biology" is called.
Instead of oil raw materials one uses to the production of polyurethane effervescence more and more often naturelle oils - for example, castor oil and soy-bean oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Biology is called with mattresses which passes her core of materials of purely natural origin," Petr Va š íček from the company Tropico explains plus.
However, physical materials are also used in the production by mattress relations - besides, one of the first ones was an aloe Vera.
However, one can also allow himself microcapsules which spread while sleeping fresh forest smell or lavender smell.
Also here one makes a difference between man and woman.
While with the men a "cooling" plant essence from birch sheets is used, so that the mattress relation can absorb the warmth and cool the body, the relations for women have "warming" effect.
Essences from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, to the weaker gender becomes while sleeping pleasantly warm.
Und sterben heutigen Favoriten?
Mattresses from cold foam (he has bigger pores with destroyed cell structure and, hence, is more cellular than customary polyurethane and also is much more adaptable).
From the combination the different stiff (hardness) of cold effervescence and Visco effervescence originate more zonal mattresses which exactly know where head, hip and heels are.
However, for a high-quality mattress one has to fork out 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are normally loaded with lower value added tax, because they are valid than medical aid.
As the first Czech enterprise this advantage was given Gumotex.
One sees to save in the mattress and in the rust is not so light.
Every now and then there are special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses at a price of one.
Thus the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with Visco foam verstepptem in the relation Memory for 11,990 CZK.
One gets the second one free in addition.
It was the material Tempur which initiated the era of the viskoelastischen foamed plastics with open cell structure and high density in nearly cosmic tempo.
No miracle, nevertheless, they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are put out by the starts to huge overloadings.
Tempur becomes soft with warmth, in chill environment it hardens again.
Thus it adapts itself to the human body perfectly and distributes in optimum manner the body pressure.
Hence, it is not only ideally for the prevention of pressure fire, but raises in general the sleeping comfort.
Viskoelastische foamed plastics become not only with mattresses, but also uses with other health products, as for example with special foot upholsterers who should get the legs and the vessels of relief.
For example, the foamed plastics Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products use local manufacturer.
More and more parents want person-supervision devices to have the kids under control
The fear around own children grows and thus more and more parents consider supervising them by GPS.
The system which was invented originally to the search after cars can locate because as well people what would be also helpful in such cases, how recently with the disappearance without a trace of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is possibly as big currently as, however, a cigarette box might not be bigger soon it, than a wristwatch.
The case of the disappeared Anička has moved many people into fear and terror and thus they keep after means and ways a lookout to protect her children better.
Also for the price of an interference of her private sphere.
"We try to say all that it is on no account a matter, on this occasion, about Herumspionieren, but to reduce effective means, the likelyhood that it comes to the tragedy," Petr Pilin of the society of Macro Because states, one of the suppliers of GPS-detection devices at the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come in particular cases to the abuse of such devices, for example if one puts it to somebody in the pocket, without he knows about it, but we had to register up to now no such case."
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons to themselves," Pilin adds.
However, according to his opinion the child should always know which purpose the "box" serves and how one uses them if necessary.
Nevertheless, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out to the fact that a child if it may not carry such a thing it simply rids himself his.
"Also very small children show big creativity if it is a matter of losing intentionally certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"In the beginning already the mobile phones woke up big expectations in the parents, but they can be switched off as easily, like these new supervision devices," means Mrs. Bočková.
In her opinion it is also argumentative whether such an equipment helps in case of an attack really.
"By planned kidnapping the kidnapper controls practically always whether the child has some electronics with himself with which it could be located."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"If such supervision devices found broader use, they would also search this, because her sales would be certainly accompanied by massive advertisement."
"In these cases the criminals of the police are always a 1 step ahead," believes the psychologist.
Nevertheless, she puts away that similar devices can be absolutely helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
Roberta Čech of the society RC according to monitoring, the detection services for cars, as well as for people offers, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device is regulated because in such a way that it announces the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"By more expensive devices even an inclination knife is integrated, that is if one falls down and remains lying without moving, the device sends immediately a warning under information of the position," states Mr. Čech.
According to his opinion similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one needs to play in only one special software.
The problem of the present detection devices consists in the fact that it is, on this occasion, either about devices in match box size which resemble followers or around smaller mobile phones.
Always so the danger insists that one loses them.
One tests Mr. Pilin of the Macro Because according to, hence, in the present the devices which look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker must not recognise at all that it concerns a supervision or detection device.
"Or he notices only after certain time what gives a time projection to the police," he adds.
All the same, in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or followers, always is used, besides, the same technology, how with the vehicle detection.
So around the combination of detection function with the help of the GPS system (just as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone which announces the topical position.
The army has so many fuses that one could completely wrap Czechia you, however, only two years hold
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of fuses, with blasting compositions are lighted.
In the year the ministry of defence had delivered before already 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps.
It is to be known quite reassuringly that the armed forces have for 225 years ausgesorgt.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, at most, however, four years.
The army bought the fuses from the corporation STV Group, a. see. for silly 40 million crowns.
In his grounds for the purchase of this immense amount of fuse answered the general staff MF DNES, the soldiers would use yearly to 60 kilometres of fuse.
To the searches of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, the MF DNES responded to it, it arises from this information that the whole army would have to finish annually an extremely intensive pyrotechnische education - all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies.
Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only so the substantial annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses can be justified more or less.
This length corresponds, by the way, 25,000 detonations.
But also so these army supplies would reach for more than ten years.
If, however, still the old rule from experts is valid that to the training of every new regular soldier two metres of fuse are completely sufficient, then the army by this new shopping - also under the point of view of the risen need of the pioneer's unities and special unities - has created a reassuring stock for already mentioned 225 years.
Besides, soldiers of the quick application brigade recently complained with the defence minister Vondra, they would have almost no cartridges for hand-held weapons more, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are limited because of strongly.
To be quiet completely from the underpants lack.
"To me also does not come, why they buy such vast amounts fuses from us."
But at last this is her decision, they will already know to what they need them."
"For us the army is a good customer whom we would like to meet as a trader as much as possible," says the distribution manager Jan STV Group Děck ý.
Jan Pej š ek, the speaker of the ministry of defence founds the purchase hundred kilometre of fuse with it, the army would have stocked up so at least for ten years with this "ammunition."
Nevertheless, Jan Děck ý from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year-old use duration of the fuses and police and Armeepyrotechniker even only from two years.
"With perfect storage are fine also four mentioned years possibly," one of them puts away who wants to remain, however, uncalled not to be accused as a soldier of the criticism of the army.
At the end of the use duration any ammunition must be tested thoroughly whether it is still reliable and not the life of the soldiers threatened.
However, these tests are not free of charge, but cost other money.
Another argument of the ministry of defence is the amount discount for 445 kilometres of fuse.
"You cost sixty percent less to us than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," informs us speaker Pej š ek the position of the buyers of the ministry of defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fuses of Pyrotechnikern of the police which liquidate ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother's army exceeds already during some years hardly 1,500 metres.
And the police orders always only such amounts of this ammunition which it can still use before the use duration.
Already of the security of the Pyrotechniker because of, moreover, one keeps open to himself thus the possibility for adaptable purchases more modern and therefore also of reliable fuses.
The ministry of defence has already gigantic problems by the liquidation 10 thousand mark note tonnes of ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract when zweihunderttausendköpfige Tschechoslowakische national army prepared for her campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, the MF DNES responded, the same problem expects the Czech armed forces in a few years by the liquidation hundred kilometre of old fuses which she has bought today so "favourably."
Till this day the contacts suit me which I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious order in the competition "small enterprisers of the year" have helped Luká š Pytloun in the sales the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the past year of the competition "small enterpriser of the year" became Luká š Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luká š Pytloun travelled with pleasure.
Only abroad became conscious by him that there are not in Liberec enough good overnight stay possibilities for reasonable prices.
He bought a ramshackle house with five flats from the savings of his vacation jobs abroad and with the help of a bank loan.
If one thinks that he was at that time a university student in the sixth semestre, this was certainly a courageous underpinned.
"The prize quality relation at that time annoyed me and thus I tried to undertake a little bit against it," says Luká š Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed flat to foreign worker.
He invested the whole profit immediately again in the house which he altered afterwards step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since that time he succeeded in only seven years of enterprise activity in Liberec four pensions in opening two restaurants appropriate for style and two hotels with a whole capacity of more than 300 beds of all lodging categories.
Most comfortable from them was to the recently 4-star hotel "Pytloun design hotel."
This year another high-class hotel came.
"Just we have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov and Tisé to which we have sold our franchise draught and other prospective customers in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already announced themselves," says the enterpriser number one of the last year.
"Just the victory had big portion in these licence sales to the incentive of hotels in the competition "enterpriser of the year," Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory has introduced in him bigger fame, popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognised me on the street, often they congratulated me even afterwards and I must say, this was properly good," he remembers.
I really recommend to all which want to create something to take part in this competition.
One also does not need to win immediately, every Sichtbarmachung feels well.
He says that he derives till this day from the contacts and acquaintances benefit to which it would not have come, otherwise, at all.
"With some people whom I have met thanks to the competition I maintain till this day regular business relations."
The fame linked with the success is reflected according to his opinion also a little on each of his employees.
And there he has to seventy.
"I note bigger loyalty and pride in the fact with them that they are a part of something which general recognition is given."
I look at this also really not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of us to all."
"My name is given priority only a little bit," believes Luká š Pytloun give.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was removed fast from the results of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination Farmet has the worst behind itself.
Karel Ž ďársk ý, the owner of the company of Farmet accepted the price of the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year.
At that time the jury appreciated the strains with which he rammed from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice an enterprise from the ground which makes hundreds of millions turnovers.
"I can say that this acknowledgment has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and has encouraged our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the last year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet stood the effort to do something useful.
And when then the state offered to his father Karel Ž ďársk ý as a compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to the lease, he did not hesitate long, scrapped his career in the company in which he was occupied till then, and founded with a few companions of his father own company to the production of plastic tubs.
Short time later they started to concentrate upon vegetable oil pressing.
Within 18 years they have climbed up to the biggest manufacturer automatic pressing in completely Central Europe.
But only by the success in the mentioned competition and his Medialisierung she has also entered into the consciousness of the not professional public.
"Not only that our customers perceive the brand Farmet now clearly intensive, also our foreign partners began to the fact to be able to work together with a company which has gained the greatest possible success in her country to attach bigger value," says Karel Ž ďársk ý.
The last year stood with Farmet, however, not only in the sign of the victory euphoria.
The acknowledgment went out from the economic results of the enterprise in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And just in 2009 the most difficult year was for the sales of tool building products.
The crisis which shook at that time still less the citizens, but before all enterprise reached just her climax - many companies were made put her investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We could also not escape this situation of course."
"The turnovers decreased about 40 percent, we had to limit the production and reach even for dismissals," explains Karel Ž ďársk ý
A capable of surviving enterprise must take every now and then also such unpopular measures.
However, one succeeded in gaining control of the situation and in holding the company in the black figures, even if with lower profits, than before the crisis.
With one the enterprise was not determined to make deductions - with the investments in the research and development.
"From the subsidy we built a research and training centre, we encouraged our presentation on international fairs and acquired first prizes from home exhibitions," says Ž ďársk ý.
Everything testifies of the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers grow again and with them also the number of new employee.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in quieter atmosphere," Karel Ž ďársk ý allows to aim.
An opinion poll which clears up with senseless regulations
The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time a part of the enterpriser's competition.
Some senseless regulations one already succeeded in creating from the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" rose the duty to create documents on authorities, the on-line are available.
Thus decided more than one third of not completely 4000 vocal-delivering enterprisers.
Thus the social security management required a paper extract from the commercial register, even if him the official could have called away by two mouse clicks.
Now thanks to the opinion poll this changes.
"The Czech social security management will require in future with controls of social security payers no extracts from the commercial register more," the speaker of ÈSSZ Jana Buraňová stated.
Sense and the purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" is to take all regulations and orders under the magnifying glass which enterprisers have to fulfil in Czechia and the senseless ones to lift.
This is this year already for the fourth time a part of an enterpriser's competition, from tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) is organised and to itself in public of growing popularity pleased.
If took part last year in 3000 people in the vote, these were this year already 4000.
There is no miracle, because still an amount of legal duties which serve solely to hinder the enterprise activity.
"What concerns, for example, the number of the income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the union of small and medium constant enterprises and businessmen of Czech Republic.
The simplification of the enterprise activity is the proclaimed aim of all governments during the last years.
However, in comparison to the world the situation has hardly made amends in Czechia.
In accordance with the world bank Czechia takes the 74th rank, in comparison to the year before an order worse about eight places concerning the enterprise terms.
The competition absurdity of the year was exclaimed for the first time in the year and happens every year after the same scenario.
Each can announce from April up to the time of going to press of the competition at the end of September administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz serves for the registration. Then the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and puts to the vote the public the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
There wins that absurdity which gets most voices.
To this year's opinion poll 105 pointless regulations and orders were announced already more than hundred, more exactly said.
The tips come not only from enterprisers, but also from professional organisations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are so, for example, also regulations that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for highways and motorways or that enterprisers with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must prepare all two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition in each case at the beginning of November on the Prague place Wenzels is a part of a happening in which regularly also personalities of the political and public life take part.
This year were, for example, Eva Svobodová, the manager of the association of small or medium constant enterprises and businessmen of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Ku ž el, the president of the chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic with the climax of the competition with from the part.
"Where the state throws to the enterprisers bat between the legs, there can be no real economic impetus, therefore, it is my aim to lift at least thirty sections every year which still complicate needlessly her enterprises today to the enterprisers," informed Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade.
The efforts to create senseless orders from the world show effect.
In 2007 disturbed the people mostly the enterprisers imposed duty to have to announce the intention to the trade office at the place of her constant company site three days in advance, to want to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This duty was lifted by virtue of a novella of the trade law.
The duty which received in 2007 the second largest number of the voices - to have to announce the duty, to the labour office to official journeys of employees in the extent up to 30 days - became by the law about them "green map" abolished sucked.
And - all good things three are:
The absurdity of 2009 was chosen the order which imposed it on physiotherapists, in the speech room a mirror, a fridge and two personal scales are to have.
This order was somewhat reduced by the health ministry this year - the fridge duty was lost.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental projects, educational projects or sports projects
A novelty in this year's quite fifth year of the competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "responsible company of 2010."
Basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We would like to support such companies who are aware of the results of your enterprise activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile radio enterprise of Vodafon which is a crier and guarantor of this competition, just as well as the competition "rebel of the year."
To this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon company of the year companies for which the success is not the only long-term aim announced themselves.
The history of every of them is extreme inspirativ and would offer enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ concerning the object of her activity diametrically, her efforts still have a common denominator - support and thoughtfulness.
Here it is, for example, about gehandicapte people, there around personal problems or the health of own employees.
Among fourteen finalists from completely Czechia the Prague software enterprise of Et Netera also appeared, so for example which does not promote the origin of formal sports teams among her employees who take part then in numerous tournaments in the most different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region of Pardubice is the society of Isolit-Bravo which already during seventeen years main sponsor of an endowment fund is for gehandicapte children.
Also a paper factory from Poděbrady looks exemplarily after her healthwise handicapped employees who put out 70 percent of her staff for which it was appreciated with the title "responsible company of the region middle Bohemians"; in the competition Vodafone company of the year she booked within the scope of this region the third rank.
In the region of Olomouc won the accountancy company MiRyz Softly which introduced among other things a flowing and, moreover, on an average 35 hours per week diminished working hours and this without relative wage decrease.
The jury paid by the title lending also the fact that the company makes purchases mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' groups in her surroundings and works after ecologically friendly principles.
"We try to recycle so much as possible to hold the results of our enterprise activity and administration for the environment as low as possible," explains her manager Milu š e Ryznarová.
To the responsible IT enterprise of Enlogit from the region Ú stí nad Labem again has lain with the health of his employees and, therefore, it has purchased to them to all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, moreover, she promotes at her employed home work and by company actions she uses the Cartering services which are offered by a home protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the endowment "people in need" which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma-Kommunität," says Ondřej Searching ý, the representative of the company.
The activity of the cleansing company "Praní an èi ð tní" from the Karl's barber-surgeon the region which contributes her employee in the form of extra bonuses to their pension scheme is not least also worth mentioning.
"We grant to our employed contributions to the catering, for the working way, for the rise of her qualification and for the vacation," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch Silesian region.
To the category responsible company of the year all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically announced who answered the questions of the questionnaire added the registration and him at the latest up to the 15th of August to the organizer sent.
Wrong or incompletely satisfactory answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the organizer from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing companies gave no answer to the questions, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year," however, so in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only to this competition is not possible, because it is only one subcategory of the main competition company of the year," Karel Goldman of the organising agency explains bison & rose.
Pilsner ground fund - arrests of the police with a public advertising
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen the anti-corruption police during the last days carried out arrests.
Besides, the local media enterpriser and estate agent Lubo š G. was led away from the detectives in handcuffs.
This had tried supposedly to manipulate a just taking place public competition for the winding up of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition closed to a concrete prospective customer.
This should have paid Lubo š G. for it half a million.
"At that time I can only confirm that the police pursues a person because of the offence of deceitful machination with a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the boss of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," other details cannot grant them in view of the running investigations.
24 hours later the 46-year-old enterpriser was dismissed by the police again.
In which manner he could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate on it in view of the scanty official information.
The speaker of the ground fund Lubomír Černá stated on the relevant question of Právo, the police has carried out in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund really arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she concretised.
The public competition had Mrs. Černá according to the correct name "Request on the offer delivery of claims for the transportation of properties according to the ground law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants show interest in the offered property.
"These people offer a higher value of her restitution claims to be paid by the transference, than the exclaimed plot value within the scope of the request."
"Accordingly of the offered claims the order of the potential acquirers is fixed, afterwards the ground fund transfers the property on the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund.
Lubo š G. were available obviously information who had announced himself upon the request and because he himself was an entitled person, because he had bought a row from restitution claims to himself, he offered to a property interest that he withdraws from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
This would also be an enough explanation of it, which is why he had such a big amount of money with himself in his arrest.
Lubo š G. already had in the past much too good contacts with the Pilsner ground fund.
Thus he also played in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role who was pursued criminal because he published in spare restitutions properties to which already location decisions had been liked to building project.
At that time Lubo š G. of the ground fund acquired, for example, also properties which were determined for the construction of public streets, more exactly said, here where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale was planned to the industrial area Borské pole.
Later he exchanged this very favourably with the City Council for a house directly in the historical centre of the town which exceeded the value of the properties far.
The city hall had to do of then heavy heart Kleinbeigeben not to endanger the building project by the blocking of the properties.
The residential costs of the households rise by some Hundred monthly
The households must count from January not only on higher costs for all energy kinds, but also with higher water fees and sewage fees and for district heating and in some places also there grow the rents.
Families will have to pull thus from January several hundred crowns monthly more from the purse than up to now.
Stream becomes to at cost of 4.6 percent, one will have to pay gas about 2 percent and more, in some towns up to a tenth more for water deliveries and in some places the district heating deliveries also raise the price of.
Only the stream price increase costs the flat households yearly to some hundred crowns more.
Besides, the strong stream prices were lowered by all main suppliers, the clear support of the stream production from renewable springs, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen is responsible.
Though gas will have only moderately more expensive, this, however, exactly when the people must heat mostly and the highest consumption.
Also here is to be calculated on some hundred crowns more per year.
While stream and gas become more expensive in completely Czechia, the prices of district heating of town to town have passed away.
Above all of bigger places to level price increases.
Thus, for example, the households must pay in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating monthly up to 50 crowns more, more than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec.
9 percent higher water fees and sewage fees and this threaten the inhabitants of Prague again for the case that the town raises the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague belongs in comparison to completely Czechia, nevertheless, also furthermore to the lowest ones.
In the north Bohemian where the prices belong by now to the highest ones water fees and sewage fees should rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rent price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 flats, with which from January the so-called. Rent regulation is lost.
Thus plans, for example, the flat enterprise CPI Byty which owns 2500 flats in Ú stí nad Labem to raise the rents from January immediately by hundred percent.
Who does not agree with this rent rise, those wants to prosecute the enterprise judicially.
The adjusted rents which one pays even today in roughly 300,000 flats might rise the next year about more than 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it simply looks too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also sometimes a good whisky which one has stolen from the father from Liveable.
These are the drinks after whose pleasure drunk Czech teenagers must become most often emergency-treated under fifteen.
No exception are the children who must sleep off her cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This arises from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the child departments of medical centres.
"Beer or wine are complete out of fashion because it simply lasts too long, until one is got drunk."
"The today's trend is unambiguously hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of department of the child department in the mittelböhmischen clinic of Hořovice.
"Whisky if one succeeds in stealing a bottle from to the father Liveable and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that one can mix him with Juice, then he does not smell so strongly," explains the head of department.
The speaker faculty hospital of Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"Most often it is about Fernet or rum."
"This is the today's alcohol trend, in particular in elementary schools."
"Sporadically it was also about Slibowitz which one takes from home," Mrs. Jurinová stated.
According to head of department Pelikán 13-year-old or 14-13-year-old alcoholics are no special appearance in the hospital admission long ago.
Before the clinic in Hořovice on which he works since this year he was active during ten years in the Pädiatrie department of the hospital of Motol where the rescue cars delivered drunk pupils from Near and Far.
"A girl had to be hospitalised four times."
"Your career began them with 12 years when it was delivered the first time with 3.5 thousandths alcohol in the blood and on top of that to combination with "Extase"," the doctor described an especially heavy case.
"She was in the exhibition area in getting š ovice on any dance party."
"The interesting was present that it seemed to her mother not at all strangely that her daughter came 48 hours not home," the head of department is surprised.
Just the missing interest of the parents or their unbelievable tolerance while pushing with own sprigs is valid as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
It is not about a real dependence in the true sense of the word according to expert with children.
"A long-standing chronic dependence on the alcohol is to be understood by alcoholism with all phenomenon hanging together with it and this is with these children not the case."
With those which enjoy repeatedly alcohol a negative informal-social background is typical mostly," explains head of department Pelikán.
Of the speaker of the hospital of Motol, according to Mrs. Jurinová, were sent till the middle of November to approximately forty drunk children in the local department for paediatrics and youth medicine.
However, only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning which required a hospitalisation come into the statistics.
The drunk children who are brought after ambulant treatment by the parents or if necessary by the police home are not registered.
Except the cases in which children just such a bottle of schnapps in the school desk drink up there are according to opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which by hundred percent reliance is: Whale pure G sharp night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Last-named for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad report or from joy on the holidays."
"At the whale pure G sharp night I have already experienced seven drunk children all at once in the admission," stresses doctor Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off, as a child who has to fight the next day only with a disagreeable cat.
One can expel the headaches in the morning afterwards which are due to the Dehydration and to the glucose lack, in the hospital because with a liquid-making a donation drip with glucose and nutrients which the organism lacks.
"You are unequivocal better off, because after the "marvellous" experience in the evening, they wake with good mood, without somewhere something hurts."
"You are only a little bit confused about where they are," doctor Pelikán puts away and he spoils every now and then at least thereby the good mood for the patients, while he enumerates them the costs which it will cost the treatment.
Since the transport by the rescue car and the night in an acute accent bed come well and with pleasure on a few 1000 crowns.
"Every now and then I have used as an aid to education if I have reckoned up directly for the children with the round what has cost her drunkenness and that it can absolutely happen that they must work sometimes the whole holidays to earn the money for one single such party," doctor Pelikán added.
Nevertheless, according to his opinion the health insurance schemes do not reach for recourse procedure around which to the healing of the drunken children to necessary costs call in the parents.
Two training airplanes L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five which has exchanged the Czech ministry of defence for the transport plane Casa C-295M have flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville where the Spanish airplane manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
Up to now abroad they were to be seen merely with manoeuvres or flight shows.
It is, on this occasion, about the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1 which was pursued by the Czech army.
Remaining three airplanes are einsitzige L-159.
These stand currently still einkonserviert in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over them the last week.
When she the airplanes physically from Vodochody expediert, is not Jan Pej š ek, according to the speaker of the ministry of defence yet famously.
The einsitzigen fighter aircraft L-159 again were selected from in the long term stored airplanes and this without other inserts and investments on the part of the department of the ministry.
"Double-seater L-159T1 were exchanged in present state and appearance," said Pej š ek of the newspaper Právo.
He added, the army will have to get by not without twoseater fighter aircraft, because signed the ministry of defence in May, 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million contract about the rebuilding of four superfluous L-159 to the twoseater version.
A new airplane has taken over the army in July, the second one wants to take over them till the end of this year.
Pej š ek according to has undertaken EADS to put through the fighter aircraft in the equipment one of the NATO countries.
"In the contract is stated plainly that the enterprise EADS is a buyer of the airplanes L-159 and that these should serve for the education of pilots of the NATO countries.
"Hence, it is a thing of the buyer in which manner he realises the thing," Pej š ek stated.
The economic newspaper (HN) had reported before that the Spanish government has no interest to L-159.
The barter of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other airplanes for 3.5 milliard crowns had been approved last year still by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At that time the ministry of defence had written out no advertising procedure to the purchase, but appealed to EADS directly.
The defensive velvet at that time argued, this exchange will support the future export L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she uses only 24, she wanted to dispose of the rest.
The purchase of the airplanes Casa might have, by the way, still a judicial sequel.
The European commission sued the Czech ministry of defence because in the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the airplanes on account of a whole-European advertising and by no means by appealing one single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three airplanes Casa, the last should land within fourteen days on the airport Kbely.
A longer forefinger than ring finger means a lower risk to fall ill with cancer
The men whose forefinger is long as the ring finger, are put out obviously to a lower risk to fall ill with cancer of the prostate.
This is the astonishing result of a study which was published on Wednesday by the British journal of Cancer.
This should hang up together because with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as an easy test for the risk of cancer of the prostate and this in particular with men to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor in the cancer research institute at the university in Warwick.
The finger could help so to determine which men should absolutely undergo a cancer of the prostate test, above all if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, as for example informal health charges, added of Mrs. Eele.
In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with cancer of the prostate, at the same time, however, also 3000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants of the study the forefinger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
The same likelyhood of cancer of the prostate was valid for these men, like for 19 percent of those men which ring and forefinger were equally long.
Nevertheless, with men whose forefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank by 33 percent, with men to sixty even about 87 percent.
The relation of the length of the both mentioned finger which already form at the pränatalen age reflects obviously the different mirrors of gender hormones to which the child was put out in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger.
Former researches proved that just the testosterone accelerates the growth of cancer of the prostate.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairperson of the academy of the sciences, said ČTK, to him this study would be known briefly, still he does not hold the relation between the finger length and the cancer risk up to now for "complete proved."
Czechia in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just as the biggest part of Europe also lies Czechia on the Thursday morning under a snowy cover.
On the streets and sidewalks there lies mostly rigid snow, the Winterdienstler were in many places the whole night on move.
The highway D5 between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed of some accidents by Lkws and passenger cars because of and also the D1 "stands" with Brno in the direction of Prague.
Stirbt sagte Novinky. CZ der Dispatcher des Zentralen Auto-Moto-Klubs (ÚAMK).
With kilometre 91 a truck had an accident, with kilometre 93 two Lkws collided, in this accident there are injured persons.
Also a few passenger cars lie in the roadside ditch.
There are problems also with kilometre 185 of the highway D1 in the direction of Prague.
Also here two Lkws have collided.
The drivers should immediately set off behind Brno with kilometre 190 or go about Brno and bring up K ý valka with kilometre 182 at the place.
There form because miles long traffic jam.
Also on the D11 an accident has happened and immediately with the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimetres thick snowy cover and the thermometer points below seven degrees centigrade.
Columns of cars form, for example, in the Stadteil Prosek, also the street Š těrboholská is completely blocked.
The surest means of transportation is there anyway the metro.
The streetcars go with delays, for example, on the line between Karl's place and peace place.
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague crisis squad meets.
Also with the railway and on the airfield there are problems.
The Czech state road had to cancel seven express connections because of Schneeverwehungen.
There are problems, for example, on the distance Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
The travellers should absolutely find out about the topical situation.
The airport Ruzyn ě is closed since Wednesday 11 o'clock at night till 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most streets in Südmähren are practicable only with raised care.
Around Vy š kov three side streets are absolutely unpracticable, in the surroundings of Brno form here and there Schneeverwehungen and in the surroundings of Blansko one is made use Schneefräsen on some higher situated streets.
Of one of the mostly affected areas there is V ý š kov.
There three streets are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Š aratice - Mile š ovice.
Also here one will have to use to the snowy clearing Schneefräsen.
When they become practicabl again, till present cannot be estimated.
In the region of Hodonín care is announced in the area of the white cirque godfathers.
On the streets which may be strewn for nature conservation reasons merely with inert litter means there lies an up to five-centimetre-thick snowy cover, stated ČTK.
In Czechia fell from two to ten centimetres of fresh snowfall, mostly in north Bohemian - here and there to 18 centimetres.
In the Mährisch Silesian region fell up to 15 centimetres of fresh snowfall.
However, in Czechia it to be snowing hears slowly on.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
The American troops have used in Afghanistan for the first time a new "intelligent" weapon which is known up to now only under her code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the relative strength in your favour.
The new weapon is such a thing, how a superexact cannon.
Their projectiles are steered because by laser with an accuracy of only some metres in the aim.
The special floors of caliber 25 mm which were developed for this gun and contain highly explosive explosive function practically like small shells.
The floors can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only with the impact on the aim, but in any point of her ballistic flight path.
That is one can use them against an enemy who is hidden behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
From above he is not protected because normally, from above the murderous steel grit rain can put him easily except battle.
According to Richard Audett who took part in the development XM-25, the new fight gun is the first infantry weapon which makes "intelligent" technologies on benefit to itself.
"The soldier goes forward basically thus: he visiert the aim in and sends out a laser beam which determines the distance, he wins an exact visor point after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to fire.
"If We say sometimes, one has measured 543 m."
"If one fires, the weapon is charged and shoots the floor on the distance 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs are shifted
The group of Fujitsu shifts his establishment in bath Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the next year 400 employees will move her job of the present office building in the Marien's barber-surgeon place in bath Homburg in the Astro park.
The Japanese group of Fujitsu shifts his establishment in bath Homburg to Frankfurt.
As on computer and her servicing specified branch giant informed on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move in July of the next year her job of the present office building in the Marien's barber-surgeon place in bath Homburg in the Astro park, this is a big office complex in the Lyoner street in the Frankfurt part of town low wheel.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained, in the medium term even other 100 jobs of the group which are distributed up to now to the region should be accommodated there.
The rent offer has been extremely attractive, besides, the high-capacity offices would meet in the Astro park of the approach of the employees better.
Also in bath Homburg Fujitsu had been merely a tenant.
Responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-low wheel we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent binding to the airport is just for a global enterprise like Fujitsu of great importance.
Yesterday the recent move of an important enterprise within the region caused joy in the winners and disappointment with the losers.
The Frankfurter economic head of department Markus Frank (CDU) said, with it a "Worldwide player" has been won once more.
This is a "great location confession."
Fujitsu fits to the town, the settlement is an important impulse for low wheel.
The bath Homburger Chief burgomaster Michael Korwisi (Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The town has been informed early by the management about the intention.
"We have offered our help to the enterprise of course," said Korwisi.
Nevertheless, the amicable contacts could have changed nothing in the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the renter of the real estate in the Marien's barber-surgeon place.
In the end, would have tipped to economic reasons the balance.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long empty state at so prominent place.
"I hope, the owner and renter of the building is co-operative."
The house up to now used by Fujitsu in the city hall square and the neighbouring "small vertical" belonged with the remaining buildings in the Marien's barber-surgeon place ten years ago to the most argumentative building projects of the health resort town.
As a common project of the town and a private project developer originated between railway station and city hall a new Stadtentree which provided because of the massive cultivation of the surfaces before partly used as a parking bay as well as the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001 the houses covered the investment consultation and rating enterprise of Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu linked still at that time with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German real estate chance group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and was resold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate investments SATURDAY in Madrid.
Of the Fujitsu-Konuzern resident in Tokyo calls itself third-biggest IT provider of the world.
He provides enterprise, for example, computer and server and also performs necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine Main area is one biggest in Germany, much more employees counts Fujitsu, however, in Munich.
From bath Homburg the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions enters in Frankfurt-low wheel, the other subsidiaries in this location should be Fujitsu of service and an enterprise called TDS.
For it 7000 square metres were rented in the office building Astro park.
In the twenty year-old complex - the name leads on his star-shaped plan - among the rest, the central association has electrical engineering industry and electronic industry his seat.
Amazon sperrt Server - Drohungen gegen Assange
Wikileaks gets increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has exiled the exposure platform of his servers.
Political pressure after the publication possibly puts behind it 100 thousand mark note of confidential diplomat's telegrammes.
Wikileaks founder Assange stays supposedly in England.
The exposure platform Wikileaks comes under fire in the United States stronger and stronger.
The Internet activists lost the access to her present American server and now search an Internet native country in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called meanwhile other countries and enterprises for the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who stands on the search lists of Interpol should stay according to a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks of Amazon server edges out."
"Free speech in the country of the open air," informed the exposure activists by news in brief service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet enterprise of Amazon had exiled the Wikileaks documents of his servers.
The Internet activists had fallen back by the publication of the confidential diplomatic telegrammes on the Amazon web service (AWS) to be able to master the high access figures on the documents.
By Twitter Wikileaks explained to the step further: "Excellently - now our dollars are given to occupy people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks, after employees of senator Joe Lieberman would have made inquiries, reported the television broadcasting station CNN with reference to the office of Liebermans.
The chairperson of the senate committee for home protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian."
"I would have wished that Amazon this measure earlier seizes in view of the previous publications of classed information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman appealed meanwhile for keeping the use to servers the platform also in other countries.
"Wikileaks' unlawful, prodigious and thoughtless action risks our national security and endangers life all around the globe," were called it in a communication of the independent senator.
"No responsible enterprise - whether in American manner or foreign - Wikileaks should help in his efforts to spread stolen material."
The Wikileaks founder Assange who is searched because of rape suspicion by the authorities in Sweden stands on the search list of Interpol.
According to a report of the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian stays in Great Britain, the exact place would be known Scotland yard.
The Internet activist has called the inquiries in Sweden always intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, there have been threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange fears rightly around his security, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the Wikileaks founder will keep himself further hidden.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to statements from North America.
In America the former republican governor had demanded of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that the person responsible should be accused for the Wikileaks exposures of betrayal and be executed.
In Canada said an adviser of head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could use "a drone."
Between the White House and Assange an exchange broke out meanwhile.
The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, it called "ridiculously and absurdly" that Assange had demanded the resignation of foreign minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently known spy requests to diplomat.
"I am not quite sure, why we look after the opinion of a type with a web page," according to Gibbs.
"Our foreign affairs and the interests of this country are far significant as his one web page."
Now the American government puts the protection of her data banks extensively on the test bench.
As a special representative the vice manager of the centre for anti-terror measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, the White House informed.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which have become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check up the ways as the whole government exchanges information and protects.
Besides, the American government announced to want to provide for the security of dissidents and most active, they should get by the Wikileaks publication in danger.
"We have undertaken everything to step with them in contact," said Ministry of Foreign Affaires speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if this should become necessary."
The egg university
In "Gelato University" near Bologna ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The 3-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from the whole world.
Where from does the whole ice come, actually?
From the Gelatiere and from the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, on the a little bit ancient ice confectioner in German, produces the cream according to all rules of the Italian ice doer art.
The Gelataio gets the ice cream from the chill bar with a spatula, strokes them in the waffle and then sells them.
To know this, one must not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province Bologna.
But who would like to know even more about ice, that does not go past to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice makers has furnished the egg university in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines does justice everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The 3-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from all over the world.
However, there are also special courses of several days all around the chocolate ice cream and training periods in the in-house ice-cream parlour.
Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis of a new career, others simply venture sometimes on the smooth ice of her vague longings.
These are this spot 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in future a European high-class product.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag after years in a nerve-wracking job something own.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream to the participants first.
There is vital not only good taste, but also the silky litheness and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets with his training, however, also not the cream bonnet of the national and generally südländischen superstructure: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then a lot of romanticism is still present."
The first step to the production seems quite easy.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big blender which heats up with an electronic programme everything on 85 degrees and cools then immediately on four degrees.
Then he turns up in the machine a cock, and out there comes a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all milk ice kinds.
Immediately the lecturer with questions is stormed: Can one produce ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer?
How does one leave to own experimental desire free run?
Luciano warns against letting mislead from the spirit of the times.
Who talks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients," has used possibly, nevertheless, stabilizers - mostly a natural product, possibly Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course one can produce ice also without stabilizer, then only it must be sold within one day, but it slumps in itself, and the customer bites on nothing but ice granule.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
More full of suspense it becomes with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano makes a distinction between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit department or with the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides, there is gives powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will try everybody to turn on dozens flavoured additions to you."
"Nevertheless, you should simply experiment sometimes."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white basic mass which becomes with eggs the yellow cream and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seduction.
Now the course participants are allowed to the ice makers.
Luciano lets them in each case produce four different kinds of vanilla egg, chocolate egg, mocha egg and hazelnut egg - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with vanilla aroma more or less or other natural additions.
The water ice kinds are also submitted to the same experiment.
More flavouring materials, more fruit puree - are not necessarily better in taste this.
Of hazelnut egg tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi egg produces the working group which uses more fruits, less waters and a little less stabilizer.
Only a well-balanced mixture emphasises the taste of a Gelato properly, says Luciano.
Ice production is an arithmetic job: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar portion must be reduced in the basic prescription.
An extra serving sugar is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano pulls a device out with which he determines the sugar salary of the fruit kinds (winegrowers measure with it the Oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily tables make easier the Rechnerei.
To make ice does not require any more so much physical application as earlier.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the ready egg mixture is hit at the same time creamy and is cooled on deficit temperatures.
Of all automation in spite of small breakdowns are not missing.
The Brazilian Gustavo bespatters himself and his course colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit puree when the colossal stick barman gets to him out of control.
"In every course," believes maestro Luciano, "it is only one matter of time, to such a thing it happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European food authority of Efsa would be infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
Now the expert's group Testbiotech which gets on as an independent institute of the subsequent evaluation of the biotechnology formulates this reproach.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa-expert's group for genetic-technically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert are for many years also in the lobbyist's association of Ilsi under contract.
He is paid by groups like Monsanto, Fastening or Bavarian.
Kuiper has decisively co-operated in the Efsa-test regulations for genetic plants and stands with it in a clear conflict of interests, criticises Then.
The Efsa regulations are sales-wise word by word with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive with it the manuscript of the industry which should be controlled, actually, by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second spot that Testbiotech criticises an interest collision.
Thus a high-ranking Efsa manager is recently without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian group of Syngenta - and has changed with it the sides.
Also the Medium German broadcasting company (MDR) had recently revealed personnel connections between controlling EU authority and industrial lobby what has made the federal environment office just as EU parliamentarian light dependent.
The Efsa can recognise meanwhile no conflict of interests.
One falls back on all serious data, also on such of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, one says in a statement.
From the experts who work for Efsa one does not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
However, they would have to disclose this.
Kuiper puts away his work for the Internationally Life Sciences institutes of (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls himself neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among the rest, to the risk evaluation for biotechnology without lobby order.
In the thing independent experts criticise like Then that genetic-technically changed plants are admitted currently without every feeding attempt with animals and the reaction by genetic plants is not tested for environmental factors.
"We want to know what, for example, genetic-technically changed maize on the field makes," says Then.
Present practise is to test merely isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant what delivers no dependable results.
"If one does not search the risks, how should one find them then?," asks Then reproachfully.
This also sees Angelika Hilbeck in such a way.
The scientist does research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is active currently in the Technical college of Zurich.
The industry tries in this area like in the USA now also in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or to discredit.
Therefore, there is hardly researcher who are not interwined with groups.
For enterprise critical studies would not be published as a rule.
"The industry controls the security research," states Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has also procured which, a total of about 400 kilos for itself.
On Monday evening he stood before the Stuttgart railway station, the tuba on the back.
Es Kriegsdemo.
It was snowing.
The history is known: In September the excavators had approached and had begun to break off a big piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was not any more the same: Zigtausende demonstrated against S21, the deep lapping heavy to milliard of the railway station.
When it came to the building freeze, a large part of the wing lay in remains.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer mussel lime, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920 obstructs.
Gsell is 43 years old sculptor in Ostfildern.
He has protected to himself some of the lumps.
"Diese Steine sind Reliquien."
"You may not disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simply and earth-like."
When he aufsägte, has smelt of cigarette smoke.
What he will make with the lumps, he does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads in a wood near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army where Manuel Rongen has established his stone empire.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He has bought everybody which resulted with the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace, they would disappear to grit ground or in the dump," he says in his office, a little wooden booth which was once an awake small house.
Has insulted and has threatened one him, he tells when stood in September in the newspapers that he has bought the rests of the north wing from the demolition enterpriser.
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he has explained to them that he is able to do, nevertheless, now nothing at all for the demolition.
And if it anyway happens, nevertheless, it is the most reasonable if the stones became further used.
As a result about 200 S-21 opponents took to themselves one of the on an average 80-kilo-ashlars, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As memory, some, however, also in hope to be able to return him by a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, 25 big truck loads.
Possibly half still camps down in the wood, the rest is sold long ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they have come and would have dragged off what boot and follower could carry.
The Stuttgart stumbling blocks have changed long ago into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of herbal patches.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If was not the political component."
He rises in his cross-country vehicle, makes a tour by his 20-hectare-empire.
He has studied law and has broken off, late biology, then he has been interested in computer and has become, finally, a stone trader.
And stone lover.
40000 Tonnen Steine lagert er.
From the whole of Germany he carts his treasures together.
He says, he is the biggest old stone trader of the republic.
Er bremst.
In the snow lie skilfully hewn sandstones.
"You belonged once to the Dresden Marien's bridge," he tells.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warmly, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes the way high by the wood.
He points at a heap: red sandstone, early part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And further.
"Of nice Travertin."
Once the ashlars belonged to the rostrum of the Stuttgart Neckar stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police presidium, reddish granite from the cathedral Saint Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronn hospital.
Which work, which efforts, which sweat.
If Rongen remembers how the stones were hit earlier by hand and were moved with easy pulleys and ox's carts, he becomes quite reverent.
"Nevertheless, it would be a scandal if one became such a thing schreddern."
Empire has not become he, rich in stone already not at all.
But today the stone trader occupies 14 people, moreover, stonecutters, a sculptor, a smith, a glassblower and a garden farmer have sat down on top in the wood.
"We work hard, but it is adequate," says of the Resteverwerter.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
Also there are stones to save.
Talentekampf um Hohe Potenziale
It rules of active Andrang in the refreshment bar.
16 students crowd around salmon bread roll, tomato soup and sweet.
The mechanical engineering and design students have invited the University of Technology of Brunswick and the automaker Volkswagen to a Workshop.
In a sort of idea competition they should get to know together with VW developers over the car of the future fachsimpeln - and completely, besides, Volkswagen.
In the competition around the cleverest heads many enterprises go meanwhile to the close fight and place, like VW, on cooperations with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates very early in the auditoriums, before they come on the job market and are courted by others.
And because the universities publish no installations about the achievements of her students, one tries to spot of the special talents in practise projects and to bind to himself.
On the second day of the Workshops in the University of Technology of Brunswick the autogroup advertises around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pen, little elastic bear and briefcases with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful Jung's talents about training period programmes and student jobs and indicates to them ways in the group.
Nico Selle of the University of Technology of Brunswick looks after the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students step in contact with the industry and collect experiences."
"VW can get to know at the same time students, look at interesting candidates to themselves closer and consider who would be possible than employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
It is new that is courted so offensively the students.
"Otherwise, the main focus lay rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the freshly postgraduates will become even harder fine.
In many branches the enterprises cannot select to themselves her employees any more from a big crowd of applicants.
But they must recommend themselves and court particularly around highly qualified manpower.
Besides, before all graduate from the engineer's disciplines are in an excellent negotiations position.
According to the association of German of engineers VDI more than 40,000 engineer's places remained in October unoccupied.
And the so-called engineer's gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic check enterprise and consulting firm KPMG goes Roman Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organises costly Recruiting-events as for example the KPMG-Race, a sort of modern shred hunt with which the participants must find her way on the basis of GPS co-ordinates.
The enterprise wants to send eight promising students thus next year straight through the USA.
Completely, besides, the participants can have a look at KPMG branches and get to know the enterprise.
Who is allowed with, decides in two choice rounds in the approach.
Nur die de la Crème der vielen BEWERBER FLIEGT IN DIE USA.
With the mattock and jump-off around the High potential at the universities the Geschütze become bigger and bigger according to Dykta.
"We want to contrast with the Race from the mass."
"Only an easy Segeltörn was to us not enough."
For talent hunter Dykta the calculation seems to rise.
"We have till this day with all participants of a similar action last year contact."
"Some stand shortly before her end and soon want to apply with us," he says.
Beside the direct paramour in the campus above all small and small and medium-sized companies also go quite classically with occupational measuring on the deerstalking.
"We try to reach graduates on trade fairs."
"Possibly on Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, personnel manager with the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn enterprise occupies about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows around the promising problems.
Currently 35 places are written out on the enterprise website.
"It is just very difficult to take vacant positions."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact about the university professors.
Solarworld co-operates with different colleges, possibly of the university in Freiberg.
"The professors give instructions that one can make training periods with us or write his dissertation."
Expensive publicity campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist.
The enterprise with other advantages tries to advertise to it for itself: Personal atmosphere, level hierarchy and light communication.
"A great group cannot often offer this," says personnel manager Stübe.
Money does not play with the job search long ago any more the leading role.
Adaptable working hours, care of children or good opportunities for advancement are other determining factors.
Solarworld booked with a study of the Great Place to Work of institute the 55th place among 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute provides an annual top list of German employers.
It questions about it employee as contently them with her work and her job sphere are and looks at the basic conditions of the employees.
Personnel manager Stübe also hopes for pluses with the job-searching from the order.
"I think that applicants look particularly after external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding academy discusses enterprise which want to be based a good call as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customer more authenticity.
And this means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to make itself attractive as an employer leads about own employees," he says.
In the branch jargon the internal Employer Branding, so employer's brand education within own staff is called.
"Contented employees are the best ambassadors."
If one treats his people well and they identify with the enterprise, then they would completely advertise by itself with friends and friends to her employer.
"This is like a play with gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drillings
Before the coast of the US federal state Florida in the gulf of Mexico there will be during the coming years no new oil drillings.
A suitable ban has remitted the government in Washington - and with it has revoked her former plans finally.
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings remain for the time being prohibited.
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar informed of this on Wednesday.
Trigger for the strict ban which should be valid at least for the coming five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune which cost to eleven workers the life and led to the biggest environmental disaster of the USA president Barack Obama had signalled his readiness under pressure the opposition and the industry to admit new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want to reduce with it the dependence of the USA on oil deliveries from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil plague in the gulf, is not cleared till this day finally.
In the centre of the criticism stands the British energy group BP which is confronted with milliard demands.
A board of inquiry by order Obamas should present her results in the course of December.
In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop covered after the explosion.
In the connection different oil groups had made straight away applications for new drilling plans.
With more sharp controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
Currently is basically reformed the responsible controlling authority which had got after numerous corruption reproaches in discredit.
In parallel in addition Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil groups and gas groups.
Now the industry warns publicly about the fact that the output was clearly low than in the gulf by a stricter regulation up to now.
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil industry and gas industry," the result of a topical branch survey is by the firm of consultants BDO - still before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
Besides, the insecurity deplores the American Energy Alliance in the branch: "Nobody knows what will exactly change with the regulation."
Investments in new conveyor projects would be pushed open up to next - zulasten of the growth.
Ogoniland is burnt down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like in the filling station: Milliards litres of run out crude oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
The people live on theft, corruption and unlawful oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari meint es Eingeweide.
"Does not struggle to you," the ecological activist calms the journalists: "You will get even today enough oil mud before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph of one up to the breast in the water wading boys with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water shine the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that under the surface brown crude oil swaths float, is not to be seen.
Here earlier she has collected in bucketfuls shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty river.
In the meantime, the sluggishly flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago vast amounts crude oil poured forth from a cracked conduit to the gigantic humid area.
Now fishermen from the nearby small town of Bodo must row six hours to reach in fish-containing waters: In the heart of the Niger delta situated Ogoniland is valid as one of the regions polluted most badly of the world.
On the journey by the mangrove marshes durchzogenen from courses of a river the whole magnitude of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water the motorboat turns up brown broth who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove small trees rise like black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sadly hang sporadically palms to be found her whisks.
One searches bird's dreams, as they are usually usual in humid areas, in vain: As soon as the outboard is quiet, eerie rest spreads out in him like a filling station smelling former paradise.
"What happens here, is ecological leading of the war," says Celestine Akpobari grimly: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war comparison is right.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield fought since decades: Here the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated more than 60 years ago, here organised in the 80s with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa the first opposition, here the Shell group had to put in 1993 his production because it became too dangerous for his oil workers.
Still today the return is kept the enterprise to Ogoniland: While from the whole delta region are pumped by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling springs and 7000 kilometres of conduits daily more than two million barrels of the black gold, the oil fields lie fallow in the Ogoniland, too unstable is to the group the situation.
Every few hundred metres rise steel racks like weird sculptures from the water: "Christian's small trees" are called too affectionate the heads of the bores.
They are up to 50 years old, most to the core corroded.
Over and over again such a drilling head breaks, Akpobari believes, then run a steady stream crude oil in the water.
More than two milliard litres have flowed according to expert's estimates in 50 years into the ecological system of the delta: Year after year the amount of oil, as it penetrated with the average of the supertanker "Exxon of Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea before Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of the humanity.
Who is to be held responsible for the persistent ecological region, about that is argued.
While the Shell group holds responsible sabotage and the organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of the soiling, environmentalists see cracking drilling heads and leaky pipelines as a main cause.
Shell puts on in Nigeria substantially lower security standards than, otherwise, in the world commonly, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: Only the rate of defects in the pipelines is higher "around a multiple than somewhere else."
At a place which looks from a distance like a desolate, oil-smeared workshop under free sky, figures appear from the mangroves: They are stark naked and are oil-smeared up to the neck.
Under one of many barrels which are to be put out partly with tubes linked, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area flickers a fire: an unlawful small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil about the fire is heated up during several hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group.
First petrol penetrates by the pipes into the rallying pot, later kerosene and, finally, diesel trickles at the end of the management out.
Thus Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesels à 300 litres: "This introduces us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the biggest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria disposes only of one single refinery.
With just 40 euro-cents per litre ridiculously low diesel price the unlawful cookers can still underbid: Since they get her raw material free of charge.
He comes from "Bunkerern" which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: In this manner at least 16 million litres of crude oil get lost to the country according to expert in the whole Niger delta daily.
However, only a vanishing small part of the temporarily interstored raw material is improved illegally: The organised criminal networks to which also politicians and the high-ranking military should belong in tankers and verscherbeln him at the world market fill the lion's share.
The activist Akpobari holds the debate whether the environmental disaster is owed rather to the machinations of the population or the lax production method for purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not destroyed them the life basis of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and unlawful refineries."
In the meantime, the relation of the Ogoni would be destroyed above all to Shell, however, so that only one deduction of the group would be possible: "Maybe other nationality turns out like the Chinese than better."
Michael gives wird nervös.
"The highest time that you disappear" says the athletic oil miller.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the unlawful Ölveredler are got by the special unity of the armed forces, no arrest, probably, however, a painful bribe threatens them.
Also the soldiers particularly coming from the land north want to profit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material.
"This damned stuff has brought our country in every regard to the dog," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction mistake in A380 engines
Apparently the A380 has a big security problem.
Investigators have discovered with the investigation of a made a forced landing machine a possible construction mistake which can lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
Now the airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Apparently the passengers of the made a forced landing Qantas airbus at the beginning of November had confessed much more luck than up to now: The Australian aerial security service has ascertained a big security problem with the engines of some A380 machines with her inquiries - and now warns about a possible construction mistake.
The potential defect would have heavy results: With an oil tube connection he could generate tiredness tears and leakage, one said in a statement published on this Thursday of the authority ATSB.
This could have led "to a catastrophic engine failure."
Made engines are concerned from Rolls Royce in 20 airplanes of the A380 row.
Darunter befindet sich der Qantas-Airbus, der sind 4. November in Singapur notlanden musste.
Now the Australian airline has initiated juridical steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She submitted complaint grounds at an Australian federal court in Sydney which allow other juridical measures against the enterprise to him.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said, his airline will require compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
In case of the fire of the engine parts had freed themselves and had damaged the wings.
Rolls Royce put out an oil fire as a cause for the damage.
Now after the incident must be exchanged worldwide up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out other security tests in the superjumbo jets which are equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been held for enough important to inform all affected persons.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine the airline had held her A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged with an A380 as a precaution the engine.
The double-storied airman is the biggest air liner of the world.
National snowfall releases traffic chaos
Germany completely in white: Overnight snow has liked almost in the whole country.
On many streets there rules chaos, trains and flights fall out.
With car accidents at least three people died.
The winter frostet Germany: At icy temperatures nearly the whole republic is at night for Thursday zugeschneit - what leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the east partially lie 15-centimetre-thick snowy covers.
On several highways and many streets the traffic is strongly limited.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in the long-term application, however, did not finish with the constantly newly blowing up snow.
Besides, violent gusts about the Baltic coast swept.
The Federal Office for sea navigation and Hydrographie (BSH) expects on the Baltic coast of Schleswig - Holstein from the morning in storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal state.
In Saxony the Schneeverwehungen on the highways and federal highways led to considerable problems.
According to the storm headquarters Meteomedia alert phase was announced in Saxon Switzerland, therefore, violet - the highest step generally.
Partially there fell there 30 centimetres of fresh snowfall, fresh and strong hoist provided for Verwehungen.
There several trucks and cars got stuck at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt the police authorities announced big disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind to be faltered traffic and traffic jam led.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were concerned by the snowfalls.
According to German railways it comes in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria for considerable disturbances.
Snow on the rails, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed directions and points are the main problems.
In Saxony the long-distance traffic from Leipzig had to be put to Nuremberg.
In the Thuringian hall field an intercity express to Munich had to stop his journey.
165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue assistants with woollen blankets, food and drinks in the train.
Snowy hoist swept over the streets.
On big German airports lead the snowy hoist to numerous flight failures.
In Munich some annulments are already announced according to a speaker of the flight information headquarters.
In Frankfurt am Main 40 flights were already stroked according to a Fraport speaker.
The winter service is in the long-term application.
Though are only few stranded passengers at the airport, nevertheless, still just 400 cots would be ready for them.
On many streets it already came on the Wednesday evening to accidents.
In the evening a truck driver died with the collision by a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver became slightly injured.
Close to Nuremberg it came on account of snowy streets to a similar accident: Also here a truck on a level crossing was grasped because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - therefore, the distance was closed from Bayreuth to Nuremberg till the morning hours.
Besides, a 30-year-old woman died, after she had overturned by her car near castle Aschaffen on smooth street.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Though the snow will be still loose and powdery and whirl up, therefore, already with light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is struck by quick and storming hoists.
However, it remains unmoved very much - local-wise up to below 15 degrees.
German bank searches a buyer for her twin's storms
German bank wants to separate from her landmark: According to a newspaper report the monetary house searches buyer for both office towers in her Frankfurt head office.
Up to 500 million euros the real estate could introduce.
Scarcely German bank has made her group seat pretty: The twin's storms in the Frankfurt bank quarter have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed back again to her old job.
However, now the finance group wants to get out the costs for the renovation apparently again - and looks for a buyer for both high rises as the "Financial Times of Germany" write with reference to a speaker.
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sales.
"We always check whether it is more sensible to own real estates independently or to sell and afterwards zurückzumieten," he said.
With it the biggest loan institute of Germany delivers his company headquarters already after a short time again.
The bank had taken over the double towers only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and afterwards had redeveloped extravagantly.
The energetic rebuilding devoured to the information after about 200 million euros.
Sales would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Branch experts estimate the value of the towers renamed in the meantime as "Greentowers" according to the newspaper at about 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are disposed once more to a fund in the possession of the bank or to an independent investor, is still open currently, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn for dead mates
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the buried miners who were explained after several explosions in a mine for dead.
The corpses could not be still rescued because the security situation is further precarious in the misfortune shaft.
Just two weeks ago it had come in the pike River mine near the city of Greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried underground.
A probe had become in the misfortune shaft hinabgelassen, however, no track of survivors had discovered.
On grounds of the high concentration of toxic gases and the other following explosions no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation the authorities and experts had assumed from the fact that there is no more survival chance for the mates any more.
The corpses could not be rescued up to now.
Now members and friends with a commemoration ceremony reminded of the dead people.
Ten thousand of people had assembled with beaming sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand south island.
During two minutes they were quiet.
To honour of the buried miners 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mates were to be seen were put up.
Also pictures and personal objects, under it clothes and surfboards, found here her place.
Before the government buildings of the country the flags on blew at half-mast.
New Zealand has hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come again to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration ceremony.
"But they have never come home."
He cannot conclude with the death of his son, as long as he has not seen his corpse, said Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
Beside the Prime Minister and members of the victims several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration ceremony.
In the first explosion on the 19th of November miners of British and South African origin had been also buried.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside of the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are edged out, it is started with it, the glowing temperatures inside of the mine herunterzukühlen, said chief constable Gary Knowles to journalists.
To the hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit to the art cinema?
The director Nicola Winding Refn plumbs with his fighter's epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre borders anew.
To which audience may the Danish director Nicola Winding Refn have thought when he has turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A caught Viking's warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes from his torturers and puts down with nearly supernatural forces by the dozen his opponents - sounds ideally for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero helps himself with pleasure of rough homicide methods and tears from his enemies already the intestines from the living body if he has bad mood.
On the other hand, says Einauge how he is called actual, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures get involved only sometimes to or two sentences or some agonising death yelling thrill.
But is quiet and indulged itself in the creepily nice hill scenery of Scotland which offers the scenery to the Viking's world from about thousand years ago.
Ideally rather for adult cineastes with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera journeys.
Nice if a film has several target groups, a pity only if they exclude themselves mutually.
Director Winding Refn is valid since his wild and stylish drug dealer's trilogy "pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, however, refuses stoic to make his works with a little bit more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse accessible.
Most art cinema friends might be deterred from the around splashing cerebral mass and the intestines.
The action fans die at the latest before boredom when Einauge for freely interpretable reasons with a troop opens more violently of Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in stagnation and fog, before the team apparently comes in America and is quiet there further.
No miracle that "Walhalla Rising" has found no film rental company in Germany and has appeared now only on DVD.
This is particularly because of the splendid pictures misery, but also because behind pretentious to facade dripping with blood a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides which has earned some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is of all atmosphere, a film-become fever dream.
And from him there is for the spectator no escape.
Refn grants no moment of the relaxation to him and knots to him with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack quite slowly the throat, above all, however, with the unfathomable hatred which confronts him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, the Einauge faithfully aside stands, retains integrity a sort of innocence, all the others are done by rage.
In the most one the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained who becomes, however, for enemies and temporarily allies sometime the warrior from the hell, possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself.
He means downfall, maybe, however, even for the anyway spoilt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a puzzling film which one can hate and admire, for annoying, exciting and amazement.
An experience.
Puzzling earthworks
The nuclear energy authority IAEA has new tips to a confidential nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country defends itself to take stand on it - still it admits controls.
About midnight of 5. on 6th of September, 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 attack I fighter aircraft a mysterious, cubic building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the next bigger town, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International nuclear energy authority (IAEA) if it is about the reactor which Syria has built supposedly with the help of from North Korea in the ashlar, hides in a valley which goes off from the stream.
According to a briefing of the US-foreign Secret Service CIA from end of April, 2008 familiar reactor would have well been likely also under the name of the close place el-Kibar to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
For other purposes against it the technology from the Fünfzigern is hardly good.
The CIA led a videopresentation before with blurred satellite pictures.
By computer animation she faded in where which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear centre of Yongbyon.
Besides, she presented the photos which show the building at close range or even the interior.
The reactor has stood shortly before the introduction, one said, but not yet with fuel sticks been equipped.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than at that time, the riddles became rather bigger with the time.
The former US-president George W. Bush has revealed recently in his memoirs that the CIA was sure before the attack though surely that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw clues for the fact that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some secret service workers in Europe are rather even more careful there and speak only of a "supposed reactor," even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plausible."
You lack hard proofs, just as the IAEA.
Asked, how sure he is to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered in summer only tersely, the IAEA has "enough material to put questions."
The Syrians put aside the rubble of the supposed "unused military building" though in a great hurry and levelled the area thoroughly.
An IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar still found in June, 2008 tracks of the uranium which had been produced by people.
Besides, the IAEA about a member state received satellite pictures of commercial suppliers from the time directly after the attack who might be more expressive than those of the CIA presented arms.
Indeed, these admissions at the market are not to be got because the unknown principal - maybe Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Hence, the IAEA cannot verify her genuineness independently.
Syria has always protested, has never pursued a confidential nuclear programme or a reactor to have built.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
However, this rejected the IAEA according to the analysis of the particle as unlikely.
Since that time there refuses Damascus to discuss this - just as about the satellite pictures.
Besides, it keeps the controllers the second inspection in el-Kibar and the access to the remains of the bombed building.
But also Israel is quiet iron.
"We will never comment on this," premier Ehud Olmert being in office at the moment of the attack confirmed recently the official position.
Thus the investigation of the case drags on since June, 2008 unsuccessfully and "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority" as a high western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA concedes in Vienna - finally, a heavy offence against the Non-Proliferation Treaty stands in the space over which the IAEA watches.
As a key to progress with the clarification the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities which should stand "in functional connection" with the supposed reactor - and differently than this still exist.
Besides, the inspectors have neither disclosed up to now which arrangements it concerns, nor which function they have or what she demonstrates suspicious.
According to the information of Süddeutsche Zeitung they are called in the IAEA inside Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, are derived again from nearby towns.
The independent institutes for Science and Internationally Security in Washington (Isis) have identified these places and in satellite pictures have found a complex of buildings with Masyaf with which it concerns most probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is possibly in or immediately beside a military base - exactly with these grounds Syria of the IAEA keeps the access to three places.
In Vienna one says, the Syrians feared fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the USA is sent forward to spy out military arrangements.
Since the nuclear detectives had become attentive by a tip of the US Secret Services to the facilities.
The IAEA has tips, under it satellite photos that between three places and the ashlar on the Euphrates material became there and hertransportiert.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the arrangements could stand "in connection with the fuel production."
However, there are "no tips to sensitive activities," so uranium enrichment or reworking; the processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
Though the reactor type is pursued with uranium which is not fortified.
However, where the uranium should have come and where from it later the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, to these central questions there is at most plausible supposition.
It is unclear also, whether the remains which could rescue valuable tracks in which to three places were stored.
As if the hundreds of truck loads from the surface of the earth had disappeared, nobody wants to have information about where the rubble has remained.
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates the situated salt mine al-Tibni which has examined Syria in 1998 for her suitability as a camp for radioactive garbage is valid for the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had associated them recently in an analysis of satellite pictures for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
However, admissions from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks at three suspicious places and removed big containers, after the IAEA had required access.
This can be a chance, however, has served hardly to clear the suspicion.
Besides, one says in diplomat's circles, the IAEA has used several months ago to develop there a plan for inspections which should allow to Syria to protect any military secrets - only the expenditure points, how big the interest of the inspectors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ironed this proposal from.
If western diplomats had appeased in Vienna still one year ago, the reactor would be destroyed, hence, the thing has no high urgency, possibly US ambassador Glyn Davies brings since a few months of so-called special inspections into the play, one of the most sharp means which has the Viennese nuclear authority to put through controls.
Though IAEA boss Yukiya Amano who would have to suggest these inspections already has from an "option for which I am open in the future" spoken, still, however, he hesitates.
A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand, it needs for it a majority in the governor's advice of the IAEA, and several of 35 countries represented there are anything but keen on an escalation.
On the other hand how a diplomat points out: "What is if they find at the end nothing at all?"
Love in times of the war
Since Angelina Jolie has begun in summer with the work on her still anonymous directorial debut, there is annoyance.
She herself has written the screenplay, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Even more one does not know about that - but already this reaches for restlessness.
Stubbornly the rumour, the woman, a Muslimin keeps, falls in love during the Yugoslavia war with her Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, whereupon some rotary days planned in Sarajevo at short notice to Hungary were moved.
In the meantime, the film is turned in Hungary and in the postal production, but it it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote about the UN-refugee's charitable organisation UNHCR in Jolie and required a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported - Jolie is even an ambassadress of the UN-refugee's charitable organisation.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered a meeting in Hungary to the women weeks ago what they rejected, however.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There have not been love stories in rape camps, and Jolies position towards the victims betrays to her enough about the screenplay.
Their organisation has recommended according to the UN-refugee's charitable organisation to dismiss Jolie as an ambassadress, reports to the guerrilla warfare.
What has written exactly, however, Jolie for scenes?
The Bosnian cultural ministry which got to read her screenplay has given to some and Here a rotary approval for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear, why Jolie did not come then, nevertheless.
The Jung's author herself protested, they pursues no political intentions with her film, has got used to the work with a lot of trouble in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the awful results of the war and give a voice to all involved sides.
However, with the contents she remains vague.
Thus the second Synopsis still circulates to the film in the net which sounds nevertheless quite different: The lovers knew themselves in it already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Muslimin, in a Serbian camp is kidnapped in which he works as a guard.
What sounds, nevertheless, considerably differently than the variation "Rape victim falls for torturer."
The fact that Jolies film begins really already before the war - so much is sure.
The pressure on them, according to Jolie, is unfair "and is based on misinformation."
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can probably get her peace: While they put the screenplay, like already so many before, illegally in the net.
Scram here
Finally, in this evening it runs once more really around for the Irishmen.
No track of affliction.
For it the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans bawl with joy with crash nothing but music, they stamp with the feet.
The Bailey pub in südirischen Cork shakes because the players throw table-tennis balls about a 3 metre distance in beer mug - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the weird spectacle to win there are 500 euros of victory premium plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking play and the reserved information scientist, this does not fit really.
And, besides, nevertheless, the 26-year-old tries to have a good time to deflect himself of the piercing question what will bring the future.
Play fun does not stand on his plan in Las Vegas, he will carry on application conversations in New Zealand in January.
"Besides, I have a rotten feeling," he says.
"It is so far away from home and still I have no work there."
At least: His friend waits in Auckland already for him - "she had ruck, twitch her desirable job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home two of Tanners have already searched for three brothers and sisters her luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, now his brother Colin has a place as an IT adviser in London.
The boys go: As it looks to the Tanners on the island in many families.
100,000 Irishmen will leave the country probably in the next time, experts of the economic research institute and social research institute ESRI forecast in Dublin.
Till 2015 they count even on 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
If the forecasts prove to be true, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that from which Ireland suffered in the eighties.
Now after a decade of the impetus which brought big prosperity with itself for the Irishmen dreariness spreads once more.
Besides, the economic crisis unnerves above all the young, well qualified Irishmen for whom it went up to now only uphill.
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd during the boom years.
Everybody was used, there was money in the abundance.
In the meantime, however, three of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there is zuhauf the letters to the editor of young emigrants which complain: "Everything goes in Ireland brook under it."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who is able, leaves and our country a whole generation loses with it."
"Then the last puts out please the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a sombre future gathering because the government pursues only eyewash and offers to the young people no more future prospects.
"You reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy as new jobs should be created," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellow students to themselves from an unpaid training period work the way along to the next.
Their biggest worry, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years independently.
"Dieser Gedanke ist traurig und deprimierend."
Besides, men like Stephen McLarnon try to take the subject positively.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair which offers an all-round service on the subject Work abroad.
"Nevertheless, for first-time employees the work is abroad a great chance to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his web page photos show surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Abroad work is no galley service, but brings also freedom and fun.
How it feels to build up somewhere else something, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland nothing more, now he works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up just a fashion house.
In January it further goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His native country sees O'Donovan, in the meantime, only rare, because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is already crazy a little bit," he says when he steps after long time for the first time about the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I practically never again am."
He laughs something move and goes through cooled down rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with cultivated front gardens, in the entrances big, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan-financed.
"These were mad times, there was an easy money without many questions," he says.
Does he have fear that it could fail with the loan?
O'Donovan considers for a while, adds hot tea and says: "I have no children whom I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The structural engineer does not like the lamentations which at the moment he often hears.
"Nobody must starve - nevertheless, our situation is not so dramatic by far as in former times here on the island," he says.
"For a while abroad work, this is not the worst what can happen - maybe we thereby feel only when Irishmen."
He laughs and then tells about his father who has gone in the last big economic crisis to England.
"After seven years he was there again and the life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
The future leave open and simply sometimes look like it runs with the life somewhere else.
He has a few years of work in London already behind himself and which is why should it not run in New Zealand also well for him and his friend?
However, a thing is there still which disturbs him during these days severely: the celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big gulp of his beer.
"Nevertheless, farewell, this sounds frightening."
"If we call it rather a road walking party, quite laxly, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few plays."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as well as the support of private enterprises.
Criminal activity is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is bigger than that of the United States.
To these results came the Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey is carried out since 1995 regularly and indicates thus the opinion change in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October particularly in the eye.
First the good mood in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and her most important institutions.
In numerous countries on the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement has strongly increased (see. Table 1).
In Peru, e.g., where the economy grows since 2002 yearly about approx. 6%, the number of the democracy advocates of 40% rose in 2005 on 61% this year.
Also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong burglary last year again such a trend is to be recognised.
However, only half of the interviewees in Mexico and Brazil, the countries richest in population of the region, are convinced democrats what lowers the regional average (see. Diagramme 2).
Approx. 44% of the interviewees explained, that be contented they with the democratic practise of her country. This are so many like last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (diagramme 3).
About 34% trust the congress of her country and 45% of her government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, however, show a clear increase towards in 2003 (17% or 24%).
Decade ago economic crises of Latin America undermined the efforts towards more democracy.
This also continued during the worldwide economic crisis, is possibly due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only one short recession phase and have recovered fast again.
In addition, the arms were caught by a stronger social net.
(According to reports of the UN-economic commission for Latin America of this week the poverty rate rose in 2009 in Latin America only slightly and has liked this year again about 32%.)
However, from country to country there are strong mood differences (see. Diagramme 4).
Strong economy of Brazil and the popularity of the parting president Luiz Inácio Lula there Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America where the recession was stronger perceptible and violent crime have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since survey beginning many interviewees see a bigger problem than in the unemployment (see in Latin America in the criminal activity in her country. Diagramme 5).
Approx. 31% state that either they themselves became or members of the family last year victims of a crime. However, compared with 38% last year the values have sunk and reach therefore the lowest state since 1995.
The rising economic achievement is reflected in the stronger support of the private sector and the market economy: approx. 71% of the interviewees gave national that the private sector is indispensable for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (see. Diagramme 6).
Approx. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring to her country progress, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly 62% of the interviewees in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, many private enterprises nationalises.
Brazil has according to 19% of the interviewees (18% last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, consistently since the last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
However, the interviewees in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most high-powered country in the USA and this role is taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An electoral setback
Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect on the 28th of November in Haiti.
But the facts excelled the fears of the electoral assistants who hurried to the sieved country for the help, by far.
Congested electoral urns, several times given votes, polling cards in the gutter, destroyed polling places and intimidations were only one part of the problems.
Polling places opened with delay of several hours.
Many Haitians from whom many had become homeless by the earthquake in January wandered around in search of an option.
Some surrendered, finally, completely.
One dozen presidential candidates, under it some supposed front runners, required on account of a supposed deception the abolition of the election results.
In the whole country it came to partly forcible protests.
Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission still called in Haiti, the choice "rather good in many interests."
According to a careful statement of observers of the organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, so seriously they may also be, the process not necessarily invalid."
In anderen Worte geht die Show weiter.
The electoral authority which is obliged supposedly to the unpopular parting president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the temporary results on the 7th of December.
The expected ballot is fixed for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
Both leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former ridge lady Mirlande Manigat, have pulled back her initial invalidity complaint.
If the Jew Célestin who meets with the voters with only low or no approval from which Wahlberhörde explains to the winner of the ballot could lead this to problems.
On account of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents a low election turnout was feared.
Many Haitians were hindered in the election day by lacking organisation in the casting of votes.
Shortly before electoral beginning approx. 250,000 identity cards which are needed for the choice were not not yet distributed yet.
It gets up a lot.
The donor countries look at a legitimate, approved government as an important step by the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
During the weeks after the sudden death of your man president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, found out a wave from the sympathy which did her popularity rate about 20 points on more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her choice in 2007.
Whether to her this, nevertheless, next year helps to a reelection, depends on whether obviously mourning Cristina Fernández is more prepared to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor sexton.
The signs for it are not unequivocal.
Néstor the sexton who steered the economic policy also to the choice of his wife often put up budgets which considered the inland revenue, the economic growth and the inflation not fully.
This allowed to the presidential pair to spend the extra income at own discretion.
On the paper the Fernández government last year lost the majority in the congress.
However, the opposition is divided and sexton's death after a cardiac infarction on the 27th of October led to other disagreements.
Some regime critics from the rows of the ruling Peronisten positioned themselves behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after the chaotic meetings (with which a parliamentarian to another hit in the face and other the government of the bribery accused) the congress did not succeed in dismissing the household for 2011.
"I will not discuss this," according to the president.
Now the household in 2010 is also valid for the next year by which the president has even more opportunity to spend money at own discretion.
The economy overheats: probably she will grow this year around up to 9%.
The official inflation rate lies at present with 11.1%, however, numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - do the value on nearly 30%.
The sexton who assumed in 2003 the office as Argentina by economic crises was shaken, explained growth and poverty fight to his principal purposes, and not the inflation lowering.
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the national institute of statistics and census INDEC which clarified as a result the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández smash now a more moderate way?
She has called the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements pay raises should be limited next year to 18%.
The high world prices for agricultural products of Argentina have given a strong impetus to the economy.
However, the inflation undermined the growth push by a big Devaluation in 2002.
That's why Cristina Fernández would possibly like to connect Argentina finance-economically again to the rest of the world.
In the beginning of this year the government concluded an agreement with the security owners who had rejected the former conversion of debts of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push the club to which she owes approx. 6,7$ billion for an agreement with the financiers from Paris.
The sexton had always rejected an examination by the IMF, like elsewhere commonly.
However, last month the Minister for Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund performs "technical support" by the production of a new national consumer price index. It looks in such a way as if this was the first step to the purge of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández is politically active after ending of her term of office also without support by her husband.
If so, she needs in addition the support of the middle class, mainly enough has from the Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentines return in March from her summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie which was brought to her will have died down.
If she liked to win an other choice, it must decide whether it lifts many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Voters of Taiwan slowly approach a narrower connection with the mainland.
What does Taiwan of his big brother hold beyond the strait?
On the 27th of November started more than 7.5 million voters, these are 70% of all voters, to choose mayor and town councils in five town districts. This is evaluated as a wide assessment of the president mA Ying-jeou.
By the construction of pioneering business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, there is mA itself a symbolic figure for the relations with the mainland. His politics has changed the relation to the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 with lasting effect.
MA has passed the check, however, only scarcely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three five mayors puts, she received no voice majority.
Instead, received the democratic progress party (DPP) which recommends a bigger independence of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%.
By a presidency choice this would have meant for mA of problems.
Since his choice two years ago the percentage of votes of his party has liked about approx. 8%.
For the first time drew the DPP even together with the KMT in the town councils.
During the choice it came to the incidents usual in Taiwan like truck convoys with riot doers, flag-swinging mass moves and only meagerly dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honourary chairperson of the KMT made in the eve of the choice a speech on a KMT candidate,
when to him a man from the amount shot in the face. Lien was wounded and a next spectator was killed.
Weird-wiser it is not clear whether the shooter Lien wanted to kill or settle a dispute with the candidate.
No matter the poster according to Tsai has affected engineer-whom, to the leader of the DPP which choice has moved and the DPP in a bad light what has given more voices of the KMT.
China was possibly the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably it was not picked out as a central theme the relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated plans to social flats and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love her actual independence and reject military menace of China.
That's why does not place special emphasis on the KMT her relations with the government in Peking with pleasure.
However, this time also avoided the DPP to poke the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She reacted with it to the new consciousness that economy of Taiwan cannot survive without China.
MA on his part would like to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanese recommends his China politics.
The government in Peking will pursue furthermore his strategy to lure back Taiwan with economic stimulating in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipeh to prepare a summit to investment security and medical cooperation.
Absolutely it also wishes a political integration. But the most important first.
It waits with it rather to the presidency elections in 2012.
The DPP has anew invented itself, in the meantime.
Two years ago it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat because of corruption in the prison.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he entered vehemently for the absolute independence.
However, under Tais Regentschaft a new generation of temperate politicians and the DPP developed fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth.
Tsai met as a presidential candidate of the DPP with big approval, how Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Now their party does everything to show that also it is able to build up close relations with Peking.
Tsai plans idea smiths as a contact point between the DPP and China. Nevertheless, this assumes unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai explained publicly that her party a "trustworthy alternative" offers to Mas of rash approach to China.
Chen seems very much angry about this change.
From his cell he explained, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to exist on independence of Taiwan.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidency candidature.
Also without Chens interference does to itself the DPP hard to choose her possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo own selfanalysis.
Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run her election campaign without him.
The principal reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the other and other scissors between arm and empire.
According to statement of a KMT speaker he will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP lets assume that Taiwan recommends a reapproach only restrictedly.
At the same time most Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already nobody Back more."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was distinguished astonishing-wise in the category Newcomer of the year
If you on inquiry of a president auftritts, the people will note it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear with the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel prize lending in 2009. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer überrachsenderweise was nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding is a famed star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene already the nomination seems a little unusual. However, she corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist might have published at most three albums before publication of the album with whom he became known in the wide public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is absolutely a 1 step forwards. And with her buoyant voice and a good feel for pop, radio and Latin Music, one can compare Spalding quietly to Norah Jones in 2003 whose big success comes in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination most near Spaldings.
Further the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trios was nominated in the category Instrumental albums. This darling of the critics thereby experienced a huge success.
To the competitors Iyers belong among other things "Moody of 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a Rau-legged favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was distinguished in the category contemporary jazz in which, otherwise, rather albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found.
Probably deserving attention received in the category great group the Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue. He steps therefore in against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventuresome Dave Holland and his octet whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic tape leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical period categories
The classical period nominations for the 53rd Grammy-Award contain a coloured mix in musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is stated by Michael Daughertys "Deux of ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse," to an eclectic orchestra work, with three voices.
Among the nominated with connections to South California the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony is No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was ordered by Los Angeles to members of a philharmonic orchestra and was performed for the first time in 2009 in Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman resident in L.A. was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical period nominations are split in 13 categories, by orchestra, opera, choir up to solo admissions.
In the category of the classical period producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Unter den nominierten Klassik-Alben sind Bruckners Symphonien Nr. 3 und 4 vom Royal Concertgebouw Orchestrated; Daughertys "deus ex machina " und " Metropolis Symphony " gespielt vom Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys " Dreamhouse " vom Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" vorgetragen von verschiedenen Künstlern; und Verdi' s "requiem " vom Chicago Symphony Orchestra und Chor.

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous assent of the local planning committee after a 5-hour, often quick-tempered public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting the terrorism as well as traffic rope.
However, according to a statement of the commission from Wednesday evening, the new religious centre corresponds to the local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - tomorrow from Christians, Jews, Bahais, and to many other," explained Hadi Nael, chairperson of the Islamic centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday.
"As an American this makes me proud."
"It points, the justice rules."
"There are only few opponents," he still added.
"You are only very much loudly."
"In this valley wonderful people live."
The meeting began around 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost to midnight and the voices on both sides were distributed according to Press Enterprise quite steadily.
The debate was continued on the web page of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," a comment was.
"It is another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies deadly in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led in other parts of the country to protests, e.g., close to Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on the 11th of September, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley imam Mahmoud Harmoush has appealed for nonviolence.
His municipality with approx. 135 families lives for many years peacefully in the Riverside county. However, they wished bigger and better places, than the camp which they have rented together with a manufacturer for water filter arrangements.
The new, approx. 2,300 m² mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13 m high.
She should originate on the approx. 17,500 m² property to Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can insert at the town council still objection against the project.
Microbe resistant to arsenic could allow new life forms on the earth or somewhere else
The discovery of a foreign bacterial kind which can live among other things on arsenic opens new possibilities for new life forms on the earth and somewhere else.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is to her view after a sign for the fact that a life is also possible without up to now as of vital importance judged elements.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to the wax either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it a little bit completely special, although it is nearly one kind of 'foreign' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report who appears on Thursday in the on-line issue of the magazine Science.
Up to now six main elements were looked as of vital importance - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium grows in the Californian Mono brine also even further if it substitutes for phosphorus with arsenic.
"Nevertheless, there one asks himself what is else possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step with the search for extraterrestrial life, because scientists must recognise life and his forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were announced for the discovery gave occasion for widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms can get going biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' which are absolutely of vital importance according to our opinion are not necessarily firmly given," explained Charles Cockell, professor in the Planetary and Space Sciences Research institutes of the open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not a part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because she shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be substituted with another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the astrobiological institute of the NASA which led the study chose the Mono brine on account of the high arsenic salary.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are alike chemically, she supposed that the microbes which are put out to both can possibly substitute for an element with the other.
"The poisonousness of the arsenic is based above all on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly like phosphorus."
"Thereby it is difficult for the organisms to distinguish an element from the other."
"Nevertheless, the difference is so big that arsenic looks different than phosphorus. It reaches in our biochemical system where it virtually smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers put out the bacterium to GFAJ-1 of a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted itself and grew.
Though the microbe grows in phosphorus better, however that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can seem of course, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic it seems more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology in the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be substituted with arsenic, not anew. But up to now there was still no functioning example.
Arsenic seemed during the early earth years more often, she says, therefore, the science has assumed from the fact that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason for the acceptance that life could also have developed differently than in the early geological era," according to forester whom member was not in Wolfe-Simons research team.
The research projects were supported by the NASA, the energy ministry and the national health authorities.
Remaining stolen exhibition dogs in Compton found
The remaining two of four exhibition dogs who were stolen before a Bellflower motel were found according to statement of Los Angeles county sheriffs of Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as strangers stole from 2006 Chevrolet express train van in which the animals were accommodated before a Bellflower motel 6 at night, according to the authority statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on the Wednesday afternoon, and last both on the Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of Los Angeles county Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are in good health," according to Whitmore.
"You are in good state."
"You were returned to her lawful owners."
Whitmore made no specifics the site of the discovery of the dogs still to the circumstances which have led to her discovery.
"The inquiries still run."
"We would not like to say in addition any more," explains Whitmore.
"We pursue some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They received her both dogs on the Wednesday afternoon at a district bull home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the delivery van and both dogs at different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10 month-old bitch - were uninjured according to authority statement.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, the Rickard and Peek this week by order of her Japanese owners on the competition wanted to introduce, remained to Wednesday evening missing.
Peek and Rickard which live in Redding were on this week-end because of the AKC/Eukanuba Nationwide Champion-hip in Long Beach in the town because Trace should take part in the competition.
As Peek of the Times informed on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show in other competitions.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the pair of dog show to dog show.
On the Monday evening checked in to themselves Peek and Rickard in the motel.
They often spend the night in motels and park her delivery van before her room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer's puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with in her motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis remained in the delivery van because it was chiller there.
They left open the window a gap broadly, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced her carriage on Tuesday at 6:00 o'clock as stolen.
Peek promised to everybody which can give an instruction to the Corgis, a finder's reward. To the animals microchips were implanted to the identification.
On Thursday was not certain yet whether a finder's reward is paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
Now, finally, after 18-month turbulence and uncertainties MGM got green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge sanctioned on Thursday offiziel him Gläuberplan "prepare" to erase the debts at the rate of 5$ billion and to pave the way the 86-year-old entertainment enterprise for new films and variety shows.
According to the statements of Thursday the plan fulfils the demands of the US-bankruptcy right, so that nothing is in way of the new start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment. Barber and pear tree will project to the a little bit shed studio as a general manager.
The employee's number is lowered from more than 400 upon approx. 320.
For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force really when JPMorgan Chase has concluded a planned loan of 500$ million for the financing of the new MGM productions.
At the moment a syndicate of the investment bank which itself introduces 75$ million leads the enterprise. The financing should stand till the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May, 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co to help the enterprise management which fought $ million / years with interest payments at the rate of 300, in the solution of her financial problems.
In August the manager Harry Sloan was substituted with Stephen Cooper, to a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert who became known by his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
To solve the efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the finance worries MGMs and to pay out more than 140 Gläuber of the studio, lasted longer than expected.
After discussions of many months the parties decided in the end of 2009 to offer the enterprise to the purchase.
However, the auction drew only few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the 2 demanded by the Gläubigern to $ billion.
In the spring this year everything began from the front when the MGM team began with the reorganisation plan which was signed after debates of many months and internal disputes at the end of October, finally, by the Gläubigern.
If MGM has officially got over the bankruptcy during the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper for her work receive a bonus at the rate of several million dollars.
The portion for Moelis & Co. which have already received 1,2$ million, amounts to 9,5$ million.
$ million receive a "successful bonus" from 4 Cooper to which for the management of the enterprise monthly 375.000$ was paid.
Barber and pear tree plan to take up the production with MGM again. This year the studio brought out only one film and provided a plan for one year with seven or eight films which should come in the beginning of 2012 to the cinemas.
Further they plan two films after the "small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs in addition a separate loan between 265$ million to 275$ million for his financial portion in these both films which should originate under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn who has financed approx. 18% of the MGM advance tried a coalescence of the studio with Lions gate entertainment whose biggest stockholder is he.
However, the last negotiations between both enterprises led to no result.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in the balance
This year's favorite under the presents is possibly followed iPad, by a Microsoft Kinect videoconsole. Both games can tear a substantial hole in your gift budget.
iPad costs so many like five BMX bikes for 99$, while the price of a Kinect play about 10 classical Springseilen or approx. 48 tins Play-Doh corresponds.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently I visited in search of three electronics toys under 80$ three national toys traders - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a club BJ's Wholesale.
To me it became clear immediately that of moor law was come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost at the same time a little less than last year.
And although less new toys with own web page appear, is found in the best known this kind, Webkinz and club of Penguin, a broader offer.
There come more and more button cells pursued toys on the market, and a lot of contain chargeable accumulators.
Here some recommendations.
(If differently given, are not all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as largely as guinea pig which sing a mark if one presses her belly.
Once press corresponds to a mark, by repeated pressure one can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started with the pressure once, you cannot stop any more.
For a combination of Gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price 60$, for children from 2) is the best choice.
The animatronische doll interplays like offers 'basis of the Elmo developed last year live technology Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with bicycle blocking she controls the Moon-Walk.
The children who tested the device use Mickey as a dancing instructor. Nevertheless, their parents complained to the missing volume control.
If you are a child of the 80th, remember absolutely Alphie, one of the first computerised learning toys.
Now he is there again (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3), with a whole heap of interrogative maps with which a drive can become one teaching hour with a know-it-all with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you did not like to entrust with your Smartphone your child with pleasure, are here three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60$ for children of from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard.

Police applications in China become gentler
Like an education officer there walked seaweed Shenbin about an urban place, checked his nervous subordinates and gave, besides, with military Authorität and subdued voice orders.
He wanted, that his female members of the Chengguan - to robust guards of China of the urban order, dreaded and despised for her arbitrary raids and her slope to the power - which spectators impress.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Points them," he whispered to them, "as pretty girls are so!"
Four girls, hardly to the teenager's age grow out, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood to attention.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight row.
Four well-arranged hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white touched loops.
"For me they look on an average," notes Mr. Tang contemptuous.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of town inspectors of China.
In a town all new applicants must have a Master's certificate.
The province Guangdong introduced a radiant blue uniform instead of the grey-green.
Wuhan in middle China substituted power by down stiff: In 2009 according to circled reports 50 officials a not properly put up snack carriage and stared at the operator, until this packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a town district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, would like to change the image basically.
Since 2003 13 women strengthen the urban police stripes. They were selected special on account of her appearance, her good figure and her youth.
They should lend a softer, feminine aspect to the coarse police.
However, unfortunately, it would hardly also succeed Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad picture which the Chinese of these town commands have.
Rightly, according to the critics.
Differently than the police the urban laws may put through this official only help of penalties or other administrative punishments.
However, the Chinese media show as a matter of routine another picture.
In January, 2008 officials beat a spectator to death in the province of Hubei when this she filmed with his mobile phone with how they knocked down a protest action against a garbage waste dump.
Last year a training manual of the Peking officials was stolen and published on the Internet. In it it is described how delinquents can be beaten up without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai water melon trader suffered after a brawl with five employed cerebral injuries.
A video game being full before power that from the Internet can be downloaded shows qualified officials in an attack at street vendor in China.
"Chengguan makes fear to the government," the national newspaper China Daily moaned last year, after other controversies with regard to the tactics.
The newspaper required a "really thorough purge."
Sceptics find the current beginning clearly insufficient.
When of the Distrik in October by announcement searched eight female recruits, an Editorial in the Beijing Evening put the question to news whether the women had real duties or should serve only as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to place announcement women were searched at the age of from 18 to 22 with good figure and "to harmonious features."
They should be big exceptionally - more than 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment ends with achievement of the 26th year.
According to the officials the activity is physically too strenuous for women more than 25.
"The most important one is her image," bragged an unnamed district official with the virtually government web page Rednet.com.
"Whether the nominees get the job, depends first on her external appearance, like size, weight, features, etc."
Then come temperament and "internal qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "nevertheless, in addition, they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, acting leader of the city administration of the district, would not like to agree with this description,
however, admitted that in China dimensions default is not unusual in place announcements for beiderlei gender.
The same is valid for steady features.
Whether is to be equated with good appearance, is argumentative in China.
But people with impediments or physical distortions do not need to apply.
"We can use here, unfortunately, no lame or hunchbacks," according to Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not feel well."
Liu Yi, on the place Baoguang near of a cloister patroliert, is 22, has little apple forecastle and a well-shaped mouth.
They empfindetes not as sexist that so big value is laid on her appearance.
"Do you find, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic look.
Their colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu yang, comments, "We have the job to represent the image of the town."
According to your information they do not regret the short setting, because they would have more ambitious career plans, than to shoo away just trader through the lanes to hinder them in the Geschäftemachen.
Every morning the patrol deals with approx. twelve street vendors who try to sell many bread rolls and Tofugerichte on foot or on the bicycle possibly, before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, disappear here please."
"We have said you already so often!" explains Frl. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot and had let down, besides, his noodle kitchen fastened on a bicycle cart temporarily.
According to the officers the activity is rather monotonously as strenuous.
"It is almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20 which studies distribution being in the spare time.
"Alles Routine."
A reason for the fact is that the female officials may confiscate the goods of the traders not, like her male colleagues.
They can threaten delinquents only to announce them to her male superiors.
This should protect them against public hostility to which officials are often put out in China.
This year rioted hundreds of inhabitants from Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, after the rumour circulated, Chengguan official would have killed a trader.
More than one dozen policemen and Chenguan official were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or set on fire.
Xindu remained up to now spared from such excesses of violence.
However, riots are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks removes from the quiet place Baonguang, in that the female officials in this morning patroulierten, more than 50 people assembled on a street corner.
Employ had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed blue murder.
After 15-minute hesitation the officials with fierce face made a way the way to her vehicles and continued by the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male patrol, stayed behind. Besides, he turned his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues the co-ordinators - men play more than 40 - a purely supporting role.
However, they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go forward verbally."
"Sometimes, however, also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"The people start most time with the quarrel."
Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations which were raised after his Affaire with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get a lobby activity her husband against him, announced the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
This decision finishes the heaviest legal reproach against senator Ensign, to the Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal which nationally provided for headlines and moved to his career a damper he was valid as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As senator Ensign office announced, he was high pleased with the judgment according to the one-year-old investigation "."
Nevertheless, the ethical committee of the senate could cover one more Disziplarstrafe.
After statement of Ensigns to lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice about the fact that the investigations were put against senator Ensign and that in this matter no other accusations are given.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself to the case.
The judgment was for many ethical lawyers beyond the Ministry of Justice a surprise. In her opinion there were enough proofs of the fact that Ensign has ignored the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents which were disclosed for the first time in October, 2009 in the New York Times gave occasion for the supposition that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, to lucrative orders helped to buy his silence about an Affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during an electoral campaign Ensigns as a treasurer.
Ensign got in touch with some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and questionings he took over for them after the setting Hamptons lobby work.
Because Hampton was an electoral team recently still in Ensigns, it was he might take over during 1 year no lobby work for his former employer or the whole senate.
According to statement of ethical experts the unusual agreement offended between Ensign and Hampton which were friends before the Affaire closely against the so-called ban of the Drehtür-Lobbykratie.
According to the published clues "it concerns apparently an arrangement and the offence against the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who stand in the visor of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice refused officially to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, said Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers, the ministry seems very carefully in taking up political accusations after a huge number of defeats which were pursued by the media with big interest, including the decision last year to drop the accusation against the former senator Ted Stevens because of failure on the part of the public prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously fright-like," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union "of Citizen for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of lawyers which has brought different accusations against Mr. Ensign in court.
"This means basically that government officials of high standing can assume now from the fact that the laws are not valid for them," she added.
Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign, said during an interview, he has received a phone phone call of a public prosecutor on Monday and next the next day in which was informed of him that the ministry will lodge no complaints against his client.
Of Mr. Ensign defender had co-operated with the public prosecutors to persuade them of the fact that the senator, as his office repeated in an explanation on Wednesday once more, has "according to the law traded."
Of Mr. Coggin it declined more exactly to explain the juridical arguments which he had brought forward towards the public prosecutors.
"To me is not about to go to the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much would be said: We believe to have made the right decision," he said.
The last month the federal choice commission has decided to put the inquiries because of a separate complaint by the ethical group after which a payment of 96,000$ of Mr. Ensign parents has offended to the Hamptons against the federal choice law.
The electoral commission said, there have not been enough proofs that the money has been something else than a present.
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada which supported the senator long time was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit.
Eine E-Mail vom Dezember 2008 belegt, dass, sterben nachdem Firma Herr Hampton als Lobbyist weitergebracht Hut, Herr Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, eine Unterredung mit Herr Hampton hatte, in der er ihm mitteilte, dass er beim Innenministerium wegen einer Sache "anklopfe."
Krieg von Herrn Ensign außerdem mit Herr Hampton und einem anderen Kunden aus Nevada, Allegiant Luft, zum Mittagessen verabredet und Fledermaus-Bastelraum Verkehrsminister, ein Treffen im Namen der Fluggesellschaft zu vereinbaren, nachdem diese Herr Hampton zwecks Lobbyarbeit eingestellt hatte.
When the last year for the first time information about this affair penetrated to the public, Mr. Ensign apologises to his voters and gave up his position in the senate where he had stood in the order of rank of the Republicans at the fourth place.
After he had not struck many months any more, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago to the reporters at which he aims the third term of office in the senate.
Not be in the announcement, that Mr. Ensign more investigations longer police the aim, explained his press agent, Jennifer Cooper who hopes senator that the ethical commission follows very fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and puts his inquiries.
"Senator Ensign is glad to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws the attention to Twitter
Half-dozen of them typed themselves in the riots in the courtroom away.
In the minute tact they sent about Twitter her reports on terrible witness's statements.
At the end, according to the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter announcements about the process around rape and in beds chained children in a house which rose in flames.
On Thursday becomes the carefully presecuted process of Steven J. Hayes who was accused to have killed three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to an official end come if the judgement about the death sentence which has pronounced the jury falls.
However, of Mr. Haye lawyers applications have already submitted at court which demonstrate reasons for an appeal and which will occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that that it has come by the intensive reporting about the process - also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and an immediate penetration widespread so far of riotous details, so that the jury has been influenced in inadmissible manner by the public indignation.
This objection could arrange the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies make new rules in the courtroom inevitably.
"As well as I have experienced it during this process, I think that it is really a danger if the move of the new technologies influences the right of every singles on a fair process in the courtroom," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the uppermost chamber court, rejected the last week the applications by decision concisely when he said that the new media are controlled "carefully" would become, and that there would be no proof of the fact that the jury has been done by passions.
However, this was not with certainty yet the last word in this thing.
Since decades court objections have found out that the reporting about famous-infamous cases lets arise doubt about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States has lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, to an Osteopathen from Cleveland who should have killed his woman and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some one thinks that the TV serial and the feature is based "on the run" on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court objections which look at Mr. Haye conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication ways from the courtroom which were still inconceivable at the moment of the case Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason, about the influence of the new media in processes which are pursued by a wide public, disturbs to be," said John J. Donohue III, professor to Stanford Law School who has examined the capital punishment in Connecticut. According to his report it is covered arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication from the courtroom could bring the actions more fairly.
The Twitter matter is only one of many which the lawyers of Mr. Haye demonstrate to discuss for years and to put off therefore a conviction.
The defenders also state, for example, that of Mr. Haye could have been already precondemned when judge Blue had not allowed to them to test the reactions of potential jurors, while one showed them during the juror's choice terrible scene photos.
Some of the jurors have said, they would have fulfilled photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, with loathing.
The defenders say, they would also question the constitutional moderation of the capital punishment constitution, and argue that the judge has exchanged falsely a juror who has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have exercised inadmissible Wise pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury about the week-end.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, the biggest interest on itself pulls her arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process maybe.
In a judgment challenge which they have submitted the last month they found out that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate by the candidates.
They argued that the new media would continuously have anew kindled the flames of the emotions about the case.
"One has not experienced such a day-to-day Andrang of the media beepers, cameras and reporters beyond the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "before still in New Haven and maybe even nationally yet."
Their main focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
During interviews some journalists said that the assertion, this direct news are incendiary as reports which are made more slowly, a technology-hostile look is which becomes impoverished the reporting about future processes.
However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would be often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes would need the adaptation by the courts.
Of Mr. Hayer lawyers strengthen this assertion.
In her objection they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in which the conviction was lifted by Dr. Sheppard on account of the reporting and made clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," so they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness connect the separating?
After a campaign in terms of abuse and Negativität this week has broken out little politeness in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real bipartisan cooperation or one moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and points of the congress brought no breakthrough in the big questions with which one to yourself during so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are made, had to occupy.
After all what one hears it was to be governed neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an attention of her divided responsibilit, but rather an empty episode of a parteilichen point collecting.
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was also civilised, in spite of the political differences which exist between the members furthermore.
It seems to be clear that a narrow interaction for a period of months lets arise a mutual respect which separates the ideological gap, furthermore the members of each other, veils.
This hardly is enough to state, it has broken a new era of the cooperation.
Now both sides are in a test phase - in which one calls in the other sign of the willingness to co-operate and compromise readiness, while one himself tries to weigh the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party leading of the war.
Hence, were limited the meeting on Tuesday and his appraisal by the participants on a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as that one could expect a quick change of the atmosphere which ruled during the past two years.
No matter whether it is about taxes, donations, health or claims, both sides are kilometre-far removed of each other.
Finally the November choice has mildly tuned Washington at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush's government who works now for the "Ethics and public Policy centre."
"This is unavoidable after elections.
Elections wake parteiliche passions which die again.
And this feels well in such a way."
In some questions, particularly in those, on the agenda "lame duck session" stand, Republicans and democrats have no other choice, than to find a solution."
Bush's tax lowerings end at the end of the year, and nobody recommends this.
Both sides want to find a way, around some or even everybody receives to, now it is passing or lasting.
Also a compromise is to be expected with regard to the raised unemployment benefits, even if only because the Republicans it cannot afford that one believes, the favoured tax lowerings for the empires, while they refuse a support to jobless workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism has risen that one itself in these questions during "lame duck session" to some and at the same time also the new START contract can ratify.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions lame duck session" not compelling to a lasting cooperation of the parties must lead if the new 112th congress calls up in January.
Instead, so he says, a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens is more likely, is maybe even unavoidable.
"After the things which must be done are done, this short-term psychology will overturn in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is divided by many - which leads politeness to true cooperation.
"I see a lot what happens from today till 2012, as a prefight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this deal a lot with the presentation of the new republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful their education.
How anxiously the republican leaders may also be about the fact that they play poker too high, they know that they must try, her promises to lower the issues of the government and to cancel the health reform to keep.
These party lines become already clear in the first reactions with regard to the recommendations of the deficit commission which contain a tax revision and beginning some taxes as well as the increase of the retirement age and the depressions of the state expenses.
The acting chairpersons Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have pressed, according to her own appraisal, so much to bet the deficit question on the public agenda that these cannot be ignored any more.
But they need within the commission 14 18 voices to make her plan the official recommendation and they fight very much to come even to the nearness of this number.
The biggest opposition is found in the elective representatives of the committee, because in finance questions, at least today, only little elbowroom or little sympathy is for compromises.
Galston forecasts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the congress.
The first fight will take place the next year in the form of party collisions if the Republicans Obama challenge concerning the budget, the taxes and the health system, later then followed from a phase of bigger zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
One proves that, in spite of the partiality of the topical choice, the majority of the Americans still wishes that both parties work together.
If confrontation leads in a dead end how it has happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention carefully to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to the losing, will change the course and must search the compromise.
Indeed, this may be an optimistic perception.
Today partiality and polarisation are bigger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the congressional Republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time the activists of both parties see in 2010 as a pure prelude for a choice by far more far-reaching in consequence in 2012.
Thus seen the politeness which is carried this week to the show may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will require much more trouble on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions which separate the both still of each other.
Trickled through US document portrays Moscow as a harbour of the corruption
The control of the town lies in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and she transmits a part of the bribes and the protection money which she collects, to the Kremlin. Thus the American message reported in February in Russia in a memo.
Police as well as the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can hold her expensive standard of living in Moscow, one says.
They collect money not only from legitimised shops, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of the bureaucracy - what has called prime minister Vladimir Putin "vertical of the authority" - takes his part of the money which walks the leaders upwards.
The memo which was sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on springs whose names were edited.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of the corruption.
He was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev, however, there is no proof of the fact that would have been cleared up in the interim.
Luzhkov and his woman, Yelena Baturina who owns a known construction company have rejected for years corruption reproaches over and over again, and he has won numerous actions for slander against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television broadcasting station when he was asked for a documentation which suggests, he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is filthy, it is dirty."
> Think an incredibly big number in Russian that her society is corrupt. Surveys have proved this.
But it is unusual that, happen how in the report of the ambassador, single people are called, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the criminal activity has led to the fact that some they call "disturbed" and come to the end that the government acts rather like a Kleptokrat than a government," according to the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy "kryshna" (a concept from the world of the criminals / of the mafia, what word for word "roof" or protection meant) which as applies about the police, the state security (FSB), the official supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor as by the whole Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the uppermost place."
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step."
"Last follow the common criminals and the criminal inspectors on the lowest step."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the town offers no help."
The report repeats that the money FSB of the biggest companies takes the money and arrests the businessmen small the police.
A spring, so is called is, "explained that storekeepers of Moscow understand that it is the best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not from the organised crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"That's why the protection is not as asked by criminal way any more as earlier."
The memo notes that, while the collecting of the money is comprehensive, the protection even very much give his nobody; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Which do not pay find her business very fast closed - on account of the one or other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times of fighting against the corruption, however, has marked at the same time that he has made only little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go with with suitcases which presumably were fully with money to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against the corruption Medvedev must count on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, manager from While, a Moscow expert's commission, recently during an interview.
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia any more."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of the powers, so he says, corruption is unavoidable.
Nationally, so estimates While, the corruption costs Russia more than 300$ of milliards per year.
The country ranks on place 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption by the non-state organisation of Transparence Internationally (countries are performed from "in least corrupt" "too mostly corrupt").
The exposure of the memo of the American message which happened after Moscow time late-in the evening will release with certainty displeasure within the Russian government, although, there Luzhkov can be accused for the mistakes of Moscow, it for the Kremlin also a possibility can be to state that one solves the problems.
During an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin stated that the WikiLeaks documents a forgery could be and reacted furiously to the exposure that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would wear not expected that this would happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and so unethical way, you know."
Khmer blusher ex-servicemen to the confrontation with the past constrained
In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with dirty and defoliating walls, the manager of the Anlong Veng reminds High School of the man to whom him has built, to the later Khmer blusher leader Ta Mok.
"Here everybody loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he has looked after his people," said Sreng Choosing mA, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer blusher rule famously as the "butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia where he has developed hospitals and bridges built, which infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the capitulation the Khmer blusher compared with the government, are challenged long-standing followers in Anlong Veng.
In April a local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime to the victims.
In June the government distributed a school book which tells the history the Khmer blusher for the first time children of former soldiers.
And in July a communal tribunal of UN and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member the Khmer blusher when it condemned the former boss of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments the fear grew under the Khmer blusher ex-servicemen Alnlong Vengs, complicated her efforts towards reconciliation and Reintegration in the society of Cambodia.
"There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer blusher, but they deal no power, something," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation which investigates the regime.
"For them the life was glorious under the Khmer blusher, but the regime has become a symbol of the bad person."
"It splits itself families."
While the Khmer blusher rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed approximate 1.7 million people or they died of illnesses, reworking or before hunger.
When the Vietnamese occurred and overthrew in 1979 Pol Pot-Ied government, the Überbleibsel of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread till December, 1998 when the last movement capitulated, restlessness.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war of her base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta pulled up Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s when a peace agreement promoted by UN led in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country big groups of Khmer began blusher to fighters to overrun to the government what led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death, and Ta Mok which had not given way was arrested in 1999 by government forces with the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh where he waited for his process.
When her Gönner did not protect them any more longer, fighters fled most former Khmer blusher in the backbreaking poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic recollection.
Even if some elitist official the Khmer blusher kept her local government posts because they laid down her weapons, the easy soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have profited only a little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the centre for justice and reconciliation which holds in completely Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums
"Sie sind verankert in die utopische Agrarideologie des Regimes."
"You grew up without any occupational knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years which had joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer blusher fought in the jungle for concerning Veng, before he sat down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer blusher felt well," he said.
"Ta Mok has to eat to everybody something given."
"But now the life is difficult because we must look after ourselves."
The running Khmer blusher tribunal has also roused here worries.
In the beginning of the next year the court will try to put blusher minister, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his woman as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer in court.
It is the order of the court, the old leaders and those who are responsible primarily for the atrocities for condemning, but it is not said whether it pursues other actions after these four cases.
This has served a little to reduce the fears in Anlong Veng.
Topical media speculations have concentrated on in the Chaem, 64 years, which had been a blusher rule in the late 1970s years district boss in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer.
In 2007 she had told representatives of the documentation centre about Cambodia, she has escorted the construction of the Trapeang Thma of dam, a project with which thousands of forced laborers presumably died.
In a hot evening came back in the Chaem of the work on the fields to her timber house in a dirty street outside from Anlong Veng.
As the sun long shades on the withered grass threw it refused in the Chaem to discuss blusher her past with the Khmer.
Should the court summon them, it would to go for herself deny, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said.
"If there was no more pursuit, would be here war."
Moreover, prime minister Hun the sen which has fled in 1878 from the Khmer blusher has warned repeatedly about the fact that the situation became unsafe, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is that what must do Cambodia to be able to advance, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times meant Gather of the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to compose these broken parts, so that can understand like everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government about the Khmer blusher, the 75-sided "history of democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the ministry of education which contains blusher less than four sides about the Khmer.
How often in Cambodia the young people know blusher, in spite of the connections of the town with the regime in Anlong Veng only a little about the Khmer.
Air Valeak, 19 years, a student in the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of her history.
But his parents reacted doubtfully when he brought the book with home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"You are distrustful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such an opposition brings the reconciliation action complicated and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain bit by bit influence," he said.
The Khmer still owns blusher here a powerful attraction.
On top in the Dangrek to mountains one of shrubs overgrown and with plastic garbage muddy way leads to a rectangle of black soot, covers with a rusty metal roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burnt here after his death in 1998 on a tyre heap.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone shop assistant in the street edge, said, she does not know a lot about the man who had been burnt here.
"But he has a strong mind and here many people go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas a birthday and later on the day it wanted to go to the Pol Pot's last place of rest where she will file a bush of ripe bananas - in hope that he brings her luck.
Byelorussia agrees not to collect further weapons-grade uranium
In an astonishing victory for president Obama Kampagne for the worldwide protection of nuclear material the government of Byelorussia has announced on Wednesday that one will not collect any more longer highly fortified uranium which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a common statement after a meeting of the foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belorussian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
For years the US government had tried to persuade Byelorussia, not to collect highly fortified uranium any more and seemed to have reached the last spring a hurdle.
However, official of the US government told Washington Post that during the past two months two secret treaties by Byelorussia were met to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belorussian research institution.
This prepared the stage for the arrangement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous on account of the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas "to nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April, Byelorussia had excluded.
And it felt well enough obviously to protect the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastically from the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group for the support of the nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Byelorussia.
Obama promised in April, 2009 in Prague to protect all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then the US government has helped six countries to get rid of her highly fortified uranium.
Byelorussia will be the seventh one.
It did one dozen countries under the government of George W. Bush.
At the moment from Obamas to nuclear security summit the Belorussian president Alexander Lukashenko has explained that give never up the nation her uranium.
"As kept highly fortified uranium - hundreds of kilos what is basically weapons-grade, and at that time less fortified uranium," said Lukashenko.
"This is our raw material... We will make from it no dirty bombs and we will sell it to nobody."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, this is everything."
Byelorussia still approached few months ago to the USA when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach, the uranium of Byelorussia in October to remove, was particularly complicated because the material was easily contaminated with radioaktivity, say official.
It was loaded in a special train, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by airplane.
The US government pays 14$ of millions for these efforts and a large part of the money flows into the Belorussian research with weakly fortified uranium which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was co-ordinated extremely carefully and tuned to build up trust" which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry which works on the global danger reduction.
James Martin Zentrum for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Byelorussia had at least 88 pounds of waffenfähhigen uranium as well as hundreds of pound in highly fortified uranium this year.
Byelorussia wants to dissolve his camp till 2012 according to the common agreement.
For years the relations between Byelorussia and the USA were tightened, primarily, because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard of the human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security questions greeting, announce the United States of America and Byelorussia that a raised respect for the democracy and the human rights remains a central subject in the improvement of the bilateral relations in Byelorussia and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens" she explains.
No objections of the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections against the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda-caught about Spanish state area to Guantánamo as it arises from a telegramme of the ambassador of the USA in Madrid.
This reflect from Wikileaks enhüllten and to the newspaper "El País" (by cable) to passed on documents. It is added that the former acting head of the government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded, the Spanish government should be informed "to prove that the foreign airplanes which fly over Spain appropriately are supervised."
In June, 2006, after the publication of a report of the Council of Europe in which the aid to human right-despising methods was accused in a Saying 'du' country, under it also Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega consulted.
The acting head of the government admitted, the report of the advice "has met Zapatero in the offside" and confirmed, Spain has to hide in this matter nothing.
"De la Vega underlined, Spain has no objections against the Secret Service flights about Spanish state area."
"You would just like to be informed" not to be surprised unpreparedly "," reports Aguirre by cable.
Also the former foreign minister, Miguel Á ngel Moratinos, pointed out the ambassador to the fact that the Spanish government "wants to give to this matter no big attention, although the government has only little influence, because these would lie in the hands of the judges."
The public prosecutor Vicente González gave on his part in January, 2007 of the message to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the Deklassifizierung of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service headquarters (CNI) and the defence minister about the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating or sensitive information," explained the ambassador after a conversation with the public prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the USA about the "ostensible coordination were concerned between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors" than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the ministry of defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our strains to the discreet use between governments," deplores Aguirre.
With a lunch in March, 2007 in which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are anxious incredibly strongly of her independence and did this what they hold for adequate," he has given to his employees instructions "to avoid conceitedly rhetorical comments to let abate the tension."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of her generally proamerican position our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a tip that the government of Zapateros actions of the USA which could be laid out as possible human rights abuses, have tolerated or have ignored deliberately capital will hit, even if these exposures could affect negatively the government of the USA," he emphasises.
The child-murderer confesses, she has complained on the Internet to the "drudgery" of the maternity.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was quite dead and she had a Blog: "Terror in Galician kind"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández ist im Internet "Muki."
Under this epithet which it leads from an early age she holds with a cousin and at least one friend contact. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña in which it was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know her dear life which reconstructs the newspaper ABC on the basis of witness's statements of her members of the family.
The 30-year-old Galician woman took up in 1998 a respect with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She held a year.
Briefly after she had dissolved her respect, became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby of him is, but his former never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Already shortly after she entered another respect.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived together with him long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman on the Balearic Islands went to look around on the job market, the little one remained with her partner who accompanied them even during 1 week after Palma.
But from the contents of her news closes itself that her love relationship broke and they separated.
In March, 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and sour because I have come for the work."
"When I informed of this him, he found it good, but now he notices of course what indicates to be alone with the boy the whole day and not to be free, to be able to let able to act and to be able to let what he would want."
Later she mentions a communication which it has received just on the mobile phone: "I would want that you come back this month or hand over to me an address in which I can send you the boy."
She complains: "If he does not like it that I leave the boy with my mother, I fetch him if I am back."
In May she speaks of the return in her village: "This week I drive there, but I will remain only up to 19. there because I must fancy in 20. to a work if I do not want to lose them."
She explains that she takes her first-born if everything goes well.
"He will be with that with which he must be, that is with me. In the life I never leave him again at somebody except with my mother," a dubious intention if one considers their bad respect.
In July there is an other mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed from the fact that the boy who came in 1. of the month on the island and was murdered supposedly in 10. is dead.
"On the one hand César is contented, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place likes him a little bit, but then he must go to school every day."
She speaks of a move to Majorca.
"There he will visit (the boy) a summer course, I have less issues for the nanny."
In 17.: Recollections and complaints.
"A gigantic kiss of César who asks me, when you come."
"Alberto says, he has sent me some videos on e-mail. If you see if he wants, he finds me, according to a dung."
In 30. another one: "To The boy it goes well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her present partner, there is one: "He shoots money before me."
On the Internet, in Anime-and Mangablogs, there are communications of her.
She had even own Blog in MySpace which is closed now and in which she was called "Muki, die Gefängnisentlasserin."
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ."
The last man who lived together with her a sworn in gamekeeper, explains pangs of conscience to have because he feels guilty.
He cannot believe that everything happened because she had not told him that she is a single mother.
Yesterday Mónica was transferred by the centre for court prisoner on Menorca in the provincial prison of Palma.
The assigned counsel, Carlos Maceda, explained, she cannot remember the expiry of the circumstances, "and she has not had the intention to add to the small damage."
However, before she had stood, drowned César in the bath and his corpse in a suitcase to have stowed away.
Defence and public prosecutor's office applied a psychiatric certificate.
Partido Populärer gewann 4 Sitze im Kongress dazu und PSC verlor 9
With the results from the 28th of November a determining role could play the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important voice increase and delegated increase by the last regional elections directs the PP her look already upon the parliamentary elections - early or not. Their expectations are more than positively, because the voice number which achieves this party by these elections is ordinarily twice as high than by the elections in Catalonia.
Thus the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 voices at the parliamentary elections from 2008, while this figure amounted to only 316.222 by the regional elections in 2006.
On the last Sunday the PPC 384.091 achieved voices.
If this climbing up trend - result of the diversion of the percentage of votes of the PSC and the connection of the electorate of the PP - should stop, forecast the analysts of the PP that at the parliamentary elections the PPC of from 8 to 12 congressmen could climb up, while also CiU four (they has now 10) dazugewinnen and the PSC at least 9 representatives (from 25) would lose.
These calculations book the basic meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a representative - currently she has three - while ICV hold her representative or dazugewinnen would be able.
Should the electoral calendar be maintained, nevertheless, the next appointment with the local elections falls in May, 2011. Also the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue in the scales to put an end to the socialist supremacy, namely in four provincial centres and with her majority in the town council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the biggest household: 661 million euros for 2011.
The nationalists as well as the People's Party agree in the fact that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which the socialists can achieve neither a majority, nor fall back on her traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the republican debacle it is not wrong that this party will lose her representation in the district council of Barcelona in which she would have to achieve 5% of the voices.
However, the PP registered an increase of her percentage of votes in four provincial centres and could become the determining strength in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are persuaded to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas change. There they had ruled before the present mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the People's Party could register an important increase.
Currently is represented the PP in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims at the education of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell procured thousands of passports for Al Qaeda
Except seven arrests in Barcelona there were three next in Thailand
Seven of the policemen of the Secret Service place of the police of Barcelona arrested Pakistani and the Nigerian formed from Thailand from steered dschihadistische cell which was different Al Qaeda groups, under it the "movement for the freeing from Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - latter an author of the attempts in Bombay which demanded in 2008, 106 dead people - supplied with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns to these investigations a great importance which goes so far that he assures, with "Operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus Al Qaidas has been "weakened" worldwide and "therefore their legal capacity."
The researchers assume from the fact that during two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousands of passports to Thailand were sent where these were sent phoney and afterwards to the groups of which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda consists, so that their "fighters" could cross unpunishedly the borders of European and other western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the dschihadistischen net which was active in Europe. Therefore, other European sheriff's departments have helped except the Thai investigation organs also in the investigations. It is not to be excluded that it will come in the area of the EU during the next days to similar attempts like that which was explained on the last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) an other one with which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan flounder as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested was carried out in Thailand.
They had escorted from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries lowered cell.
The Catalan net - a part of it had been ruined in 2009 - stole in particular from tourists passports according to the default of the so-called "international Islamic front."
This means that the documents on the name of men had to be issued at the age of from 25 to 45 years and be valid still several years; they might show no visa stamps.
In investigation circles it is underlined that till present no connections between in Catalonia could be proved to arrested and the attempt in Bombay, although the author of this attempt, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was, one of the receiver's groups in Spain stolen and as a result in Thailand to phoney passports.
Nevertheless, it should be reminded of the fact that some days before the attempt from Catalonia by means of a monetary transfer enterprise several thousand dollars had been dispatched which were "invested" in the purchase of Prepaid maps for mobile phones which later from the members of the "command," an end prepared for the life of 106 people, were used.
The police has confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP demands of Mas a postponement of the tax arrangement
Yesterday the chairperson of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, perceived the opportunity to present her conditions to the support of his assumption of office as a Prime Minister of the Generalitat to Artur Mas personally. These do not differ from already during the election campaign put and can be summarised with the priority of the economic reimpetus and omitting by regionalistischen independence adventures, like a financial adjustment arrangement which the regionalistische leader wants to suggest at the height of his mandate.
The chairperson of the Catalan People's Party turned with the security to Artur Mas which you lent 18 representatives whom she had won on the last Sunday - a figure which is more than enough to feel inalienable. Since the candidate of the middle-class regionalistischen party of CiU depends on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties abstains by the vote with his assumption of office of the voice.
The future alliances who want to enter the regionalists at the coming parliamentary elections in the congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. The conversations, the Mas at the moment with the remaining party chiefs carries on, however, turn on Catalonia.
What concerns the party leader of the PPC, she demands that to the support of the assumption of office "all discourses which concern the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an arrangement about the financial adjustment between state and the autonomous region - like in the Basque Provinces - and which the party chief of CiU wants to subject even to a referendum are done behind.
To both political leaders it is common that they want to make the blown out political apparatus of the regional management more slender and abolish the death tax and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations to the assumption of office of Mas deal vonseiten Jordi PPC Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas Hut sich bereits mit Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - der eine harte Opposition ankündigte - und Joan Herrera (ICV) getroffen. Heute wird er mit Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) und Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) zusammenkommen.
The nursing home for the elderly confirms that the deaths are not to be led back on "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not exclude that her orderly killed more than eleven older people
Yesterday the people responsible of the nursing home for the elderly La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they put outside which harm the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the orderlies who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the equipment.
The leader of the nursing home for the elderly, Joan Sala, appeared in company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability duty make to us the process and the civil law liability" accept.
The equipment must accept not only a social respect loss because she had ascertained the criminal actions of the orderly not on time, but now also pay a high amount of damages which is calculated by the legal representatives of the members of the family of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime decreases to August, 2009 and that he has further murdered since then.
The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - because he supposed that no doctor has examined the deads personally, but the formalities were unwound on account of their age and illnesses by telephone.
The leader of La Caritat denied this point flatly and explained that "being missing measures keinerzeit the reason could have been for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there would be no clues for careless actions of another person than the culprit "in the lawsuit."
Already as "a death angel" baptised eleven murders confessed the day before yesterday and explained which commits the first crimes 29th of August, 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady to have murdered.
In this case he killed with an overdose insulin, as opposed to the first crime with which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The leader of La Caritat explained, the access of the staff to the drugs is only difficult to control.
The orderly used the insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail with six of nine committed crimes to release the patients with the death of her suffering.
But the results of the lab investigations will put outside whether Vila lies and chose for his first victims really a less cruel death or whether he burnt out this from the inside, while he gave them pale lye as he had done it according to confession with three women whom he murdered between the 12th and 17th of October.
In La Caritat one gives to the statements of the orderly no faith, not even what concerns the number of the confessed murders which could be absolutely more. This setting is justified with the fact that Vila had made very different declarations in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say, they made available them to themselves for this reason and to the clarification of the reach of these incidents of the justice.
Threatening gestures of the European central bank (EZB)
Yesterday the investors reacted sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reactivity."
The risk impacts of the Euro-Peripheriländer have dramatically risen and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%.
Anyhow we had to do the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the euro has hardly increased in points what arranges to the worry, do not underestimate.
The events from yesterday are typical for an illiquid market, to such an extent in which he breaks down to himself again recovered, indeed, as a result of the closing short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not still lose long his fear.
Today one month ago the European central bank asked us to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen after which the EZB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still several time must make in the future, a Rückzieher.
The Central Bank demanded the ending of the plan for the purchase of national debts, because these are ineffective, as well as the abolition of all unusual limited liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis we expect that the present liquidity measures are extended "at least till March" and the quarterly advertisings with boundless access are maintained at the quarter end to the guarantee of the liquidity till at least June.
We also expect that the programme will be economical for the purchase of bonds continuously and a restorative signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, are thrown back the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday again and if halstarrig is persisted, to take back our liquidity measures we, only God can help us!
Just as tomorrow with the EZB meeting in May with which the bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of state debt papers and the markets broke down as a result this story could recur.
The EZB it must be plausible and pertinacious.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have shopped already a lot with which she provoked a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year-old state titles was quite weak in Portugal.
The state administration of property spent only 500 millions to 5.28%, compared with 750 millions to 4.81% in the preceding auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates fell in Portugal about 30 base points in the whole curve and reflected with it a perception change of the markets after the words Trichets.
In Ireland the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and bank of Irishman's country.
The sum is estimated at about 10,000 millions at short notice and possible other 15,000. There is time till February to procure private capital or these banks are nationalised.
Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility, after it had not recognised the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are satisfactory within the scope of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
Indeed, the government on the next Tuesday must receive the parliamentary approval with his new budget. Because she still does not dispose of the sufficient support, Ireland also is furthermore a spring of the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has formed her discourse in view of the summit of the heads of state and the government on the 14th of December more mezzo. There political unity is asked to show that we play together them the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
Yesterday the Spanish head of the provincial government introduced the measure plan which should be dismissed on Friday by the council of ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions like with the financial institutions, dismantling of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job-creating measures. The measures which sound in the ears of the investors like Vivaldis Four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains, why the Spanish stock exchange has increased about 4.5 percent, twice as much like the rest of the European stock exchanges.
In comparison to February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and was persuasive, and we profit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a decisive auction of a three-year-old state loan which will derive benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we place on a strong inquiry which will remove all doubts about our conversion of debts ability.
For Spain the application of an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has at disposal 40 milliard euros, three spots so much like in March. The interest rates are exceedingly expensive and the access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar woman: "Now not only the being, but also the light counts."
We create only courage, this!
The chairman of the board of owls contest at the request of his children the companion's meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm during the open conflict of the family Á lvarez, owners of the societies owls and El Enebro, flaut not from.
David Á lvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, will contest the companion's meeting of El Enebro which will take place at the request of five of his seven children in 16., because he holds them for "absolutely trifling." His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the vineyard Bodegas Vega Sicilia-.
The juridical measures prepare David Á lvarez and his children Jesús David and María José for a new justice chapter in her quarrel around the control of a part of the enterprise group.
The founder of the biggest holding companies for enterprise services does not seem to be ready to give way in his lawsuit around the control of the organs of El Enebro.
From the administrative council he became of five of his seven children herausgetrieben. These appointed themselves on the stockholder meeting from the 18th of January of this year which is put down in the commercial register already as contested, to administrative council members.
The companion's meeting of El Enebro which was called up by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for 16. has released a new thunderclap in the lap of the family Á lvarez.
The invocation of the judge to the setting of the meeting is the only juridical way which guarantees the conscription of the companion's meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Á lvarez Mezquiriz is laid out by David Á lvarez as "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to let recognise by means of juridical astuteness, to deceitful machination and legal abuse for trifling explained meeting from the 18th of January" as official speakers explain.
This argumentation is the basis for the challenge of the meeting afterwards to explain them as "absolutely trifling."
The same protagonists who wrap themselves in discreet silence tried in June already unsuccessfully to call up a meeting on judicial way.
With El Enebro - property society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, beside other assets - seven children 100 percent of the capital control David Á of lvarez'.
However, the founder of the service group according to family protocols demands the right of use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the thing on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to the treatment of the action for nullification for which still no date was fixed.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The carriages are improved with software on a real-time basis.
Since Red Bull penetrated in 2004 into the world of the formula 1, her history is marked in this select universe of the speed by surprises and results.
In the beginning nobody gave to the novice attention and in spite of his precipitously climbing up development during the last seasons everybody placed with the final spurt in the last November on the victory of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon" which the multinational Siemens Red Bull laid in the hands, and with it a winner's team created, become to the legend.
In reality concerns highly competitive software for the simulation of processes which put on the market the German enterprise in 2007 for the purposes which do not deal with car racing.
This as a PLM called informatics programme was used for the development by assembly chains in factories in the whole world, energy works and highly exact instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is aimed, before this is really built to avoid thus mistake and superfluous costs.
PLM has made easier the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, leader of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the application of this software in the formula 1 - factory of Red Bull can sketch the changes and improvements which are ascertained on the runnings and with the tests "in few hours, almost on a real-time basis" explain and.
Soot worm explains that in 1992 in the racing stables on an average ten engineers worked who could introduce at most three or four improvements in a season.
Today in Red Bulls team 180 highly qualified young people are occupied. With highly competitive EDP arrangements they carry out analyses and all possible changes in the racer.
The Siemens manager explained, the PLM software is able to analyse all components of the racers of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine for which explains itself excluding Renault responsibly.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the security elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours by the virtual reality of the simulator in the reality.
The only limit which is set to this mad technical perfectionism, are the 40 million dollars which a formula 1 - team may spend on his races in a season.
Red Bull has built up his high-tech factory for the development and production of his racers in a 50 kilometres of London distant place.
It concerns two buildings in which visits - are strongly limited particularly by journalists-.
Everything what happens there is a top Secret.
The staff encloses 580 people, including two pilots, which world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls of true formula 1 - hero is without doubt the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources which the Energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of his participation on the racing distances, other protagonists whose support is incalculably and their fame like zero are hidden.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one could still say five years ago that the progress contributed in the area F&E for racer with 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the portion values have changed. The technology puts out 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can be never substituted with EDP, because they "are not predictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Yesterday Hewlett-Packard (HP) initiated his first exclusive store into collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona.
It is the first one of a sales net existing of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square metres in each case which the multinational intends to open during the next two years in Spain.
The society agrees on this initiative with already existing 16 sales areas in the Mehrmarkenbetrieb, as for example PC city, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The acting chairperson of HP España, Helena Herrero, called the converted store in the grain Vía in Barcelona as an example, property of Pont Reyes, with the HP for thirty years works together.
The North American enterprise group intends to furnish till 2010 in Europe 200 sales places, of it 20 establishments in Spain.
The first ones were initiated the last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming re-openings, however, did not exclude that Madrid could be the next aim.
The acting chairperson whom also leader of staff HP of system is assured, the philosophy for the store opening is always same. She rests on a local distributor with experience and backgrounds.
The North American enterprise group discusses this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products for giving a hand). In Europe all stores will look alike.
Moreover, HP is responsible for the education of the store staff.
Helena Herrero said, it does not concern a franchise system and emphasised that with the exclusive sales place net is intended to optimise "the customer service and the consultation of small enterprise and micro-enterprise with the purchase and afterwards, even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona disposes of a pioneer-pilot's programme which solves the technical problems of the HP devices with guarantee.
An on-line service builds up a connection with the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this manner we can solve at ten minutes of problems which sometimes take up up to two days."
"This system was developed in particular for small enterprise and micro-enterprise as well as private customer, because the large-scale enterprises already have her service contracts for technical customer service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'pinch' his rival in three years one millions customers
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He thinks that in 2001 a hard year is for the banks, a new liquidity crisis rejects first, however, and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a burglary of the interest margins which the banks try to compensate with rises of the fees and the prices of advance.
Sabadell expects to catch one millions private customers in three years - a still to be passed field.
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the coming three years, and to survive thus in a very much complicated economic sphere.
The bank will introduce in 2011 a new 3 annual leading plan.
The aim is not only to survive without taking up the public aid from the FROB but to increase, in addition, the share of the market around millions private customers - 700,000 if one draws off the customers whom the bank will lose-. This is the big challenge before which this bank stands, because till present it has dedicated to her clients more attention than her private customer.
This year she has to do 250,000 private customers and 50,000 enterprises.
Their share of the market with private customers lies at 3.5 percent, while the clients put out more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the commercial plan in 2011-2013 is the rise of the productiveness, speak Austerität, cost reduction. She will introduce the challenges to which the bank faces with it together with financial report.
Only few banks dare in these difficult times to fix aims and to publish, because by the financial crisis worldwide all plans of the banks have got mixed up.
Sabadell will conclude her leading plan agreed four years ago optima this year. This was laid out at first for three years, but as a result of the market situation he was extended by a business year.
The customers who are left the savings banks are the principal purpose of the bank.
With a breakfast organised by the APIE stressed Guardiola, in 2011 would become a "difficult" year "with big reach."
The manager goes out from it, Spain would come out only "slowly" of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to create work in two or three years "" - basically for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes from the fact that the war punishes the interest margins around liabilities - him - will abate, the loadings, the banks and savings banks will have to pay for her issues to the preservation of liquidity, as a balance for dwindling profit margins already on the price of loans shifted.
"The subjects Liquidity and Financing are of structural kind and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We have not turned the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto spent on Thursday already the arrangement to her branch net to limit the assignment of long-term advances and to raise the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días from the 22nd and 27th of November).
The manager also admitted, the banks pursued at the moment the Stategie "to raise the fees," indeed, "within a frame stamped by the competition ."
Sabadells leading plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as usual, corporate shops does not exclude.
Not free of charge he assures that in Spain "bigger enterprises are necessary."
"Next year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need rises in capital at the moment "terrifically" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip off in red figures.
He is of the opinion, the FROB can substitute with Kaptitalaufstockungen for the money market.
After he assures that Sabadell can also survive a passing closing of the markets, he weakens the argument of some bankers who already prophesy a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses, one can bring nothing in circulation, but as opposed to the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term financing about Repogeschäfte and intercept with it the crisis.
CECA excludes the second coalescence wave of the savings banks
Yesterday the general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility that it can come to a coalescence wave of the savings banks and stressed the quickness with which the branch is restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on it in the first phase on taking part. They reserved themselves the second round.
However, assured the general manager of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I think that the biggest part of the coalescences is concluded. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be looked as the second round, it concerned rather adaptations."
"The biggest part is concluded. It can be that we have instead of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España who has strongly supported all processes."
With one of the association of the managers and manager Aragonien (ADEA) organised breakfast Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as fast as possible and that we must be contented with the expiry appropriate for term which in the former times, not now within the scope of which commercial plans with Banco de España were fixed" he stressed.
"The crossing of 45 savings banks with on an average 28,000 million property continuances on 17 with 75 500 millions is a historically incomparable process. The number of the financial institutions was reduced about 62 percent and now they are much bigger what we have fulfilled the Basel agreement" with, he emphasised.
Olavarrieta explained, "there would be a row of undissuaded opinions about the slowness of the process which Unseriösität and Unsinnigkeit" revealed, because "Banco de España admonishes us to conclude in time before end of the year."
Yesterday the general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that Spain has one of the most severe financing systems of Europe and "maybe" the whole world and complemented, that those which would act anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that we must come along in the present economic economic situation "no worries" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks who have gone through a "very important" concentration process, that is carried out "as fast as possible."
He also reminded of the fact that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests which the EZB carried out in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided on the maintaining of the euro, but at the same time has put up conditions on the whole European Union.
The tensions at the markets have released a double answer of the government.
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, started with tax reductions for small enterprise and micro-enterprise, the regulation of time work enterprise or the abolition of the 426 euros of support for the unemployed people who cover no unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent from AENA, the management of the airports bar nannies and El Prat as well as 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the acting head of the government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former head of the provincial government Felipe González supports the criticism of the chancellor Angela Merkel as the people responsible whom the present crisis herausbeschwört has.
How are these processes to be understood?
It would be anticipated, the Merkels position no mistake of her public relations is.
On the contrary, it concerns a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
Besides, Germany takes a basically new perspective to the creation of our future which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of his partners.
In view of the opposition in Europe one begins in Germany more than three possible ways out from the crisis to spekuliern.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the eurospace.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this sounds at the moment rather to Science Fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population.
The third: A transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict housekeeping; the punishment of the countries which the default violates; more possible-wise the payment setting of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector.
The German position is unequivocal and already stands out since some time. Now, therefore, there are no excuses.
First in 2009, as the IWF as well as the European commission to incentive for deficits created and the German government a constitutional reform from the sleeve stretched to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign for drifting apart between that what held Germany for necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the methods of his European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, as a Merkel the decision to the rescue of Greece painfully pushed out.
At that time this was strongly criticised. But fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public one and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel comes out during the last October days anew with an unequivocal position. She demands a reform of the agreements of the European Union to allow the rescue of a country and to oblige at the same time the private lenders, to carry a part of the costs.
This position was laid out as anti-European, because it sped up the Ireland crisis and all the following.
But her proposal, even if something sweetens, was accepted. During the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which does not think to cross it.
One says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - there is not the old functionality of the euro from this appointment any more.
In 2013 the year of birth of a new currency space will be in which the counteracting countries are punished hard, can be made explain itself insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs must take over.
Germany shows us that we must shape a hard growth course, with high savings rates and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productiveness and competitiveness as well as positive foreign-trade balances.
The other alternative which is based on indebtedness and civil engineering with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, as well as it was stated of Spain in boom times, will be accepted simply not.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not only about it, the state deficit up to 2013 on three percent runterzufahren.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst what we could do under these conditions is to be cheated to ourselves.
I hope that the present turbulence goes over in more rest.
And the fact that we will use the possibilities which are offered us up to the spring, 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has also understood so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on the last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out to the fact that in spite of the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in own house for itself has paved her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look in such a way that would change in it a little bit.
Under the considered possibilities that is not to be excluded that we would have to leave the eurospace crowded with a little serious countries.
In this case Germany could still say us, it has warned us.
Sport and control avoidance
Tricks like from Alonso and Ramos in the play against the Aiax show invention mind, but not the will to handle a sanction.
Putatively from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the play from the 23rd of November against the Aiax in the Champions League led to the fact that a lot of ink was poured about whether it did not concern an unsporty action or and whether perhaps both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
How is known in general, both players lost a few minutes before playing (her team had already unambiguously won) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow map.
In this manner, and because of Real Madrid would state his group, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction with the next league match against the Auxerre and get thus without maps into the next play phase.
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two plays and the involved players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is no new practise, it is to be found rather often in the world of the football.
It is spread so far that it is a part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport to obeyed rules-.
Part of the arisen debate around the shown case decreases to the fact that a team of the football club played Real Madrid (which gives generosity and honour in his hymn and had punished with other opportunities his players for similar incidents), besides, the leading role, and on the dramatisation by Mourinho who has added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provoking engineer.
Anyway the debate turns on whether this behaviour pattern not expressly forbidden by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, that is whether these actions show a control avoidance. Really this approach keeps to the statutes of the sport, however, seem to handle his sense.
With this matter the damage caused to the sports mind should be examined.
The sports mind defends the physical intactness of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was no aggressive play.
Another aspect of a clean play insists in the fact on avoiding that the counteracting players derive an unwarranted benefit from the counterteam. Also this did not happen.
The paradoxes of the action of the players of Real Madrid are that she does not correspond to him what we ordinarily understand by wrong play or control avoidance, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but she should be so conspicuously as possible, so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the sanction joyfully.
Another question is which kind of advantage the offenders from the deliberate fouls pulled.
Here it should be emphasised that the rival was brought neither in a more unfavorable situation, nor advantages were demanded for the played play, because the evident result of this action was that own team with less players weiterspielen had to go.
It is also no useful strategy for the next play, because then the club does not dispose of these players.
The advantage consists in the fact obviously that the players begin the next play phase of the Champions League without maps which her participation in a future play could threaten.
But it concerns a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because the team could also retire sometime. Moreover, the players with this approach receive a sanction and go over in the second map cycle in which they retire because of map accumulation with a map less than in the first cycle.
With it it is not so clear whether it really concerns an advantage.
At last are not directed to such approaches against the sports mind to whom also strategical decisions belong to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case the players no sanction wanted to handle (this would really be an unequivocal case of control avoidance), they wanted to choose rather, when they undergo this.
They made a strategical decision without making way of a punishment or fleeing before her.
Although the border is blurred between imagination and control surroundings, I think that it concerns with this matter a clear case of imagination.
I have the impression that the polemic has originated as a result of two factors: Because it was about two selfexclusions and because of the kind of the provoked control transference.
The harm which was done to the principles of the sport by these actions is of less ethical than rather aesthetic kind.
Offer offensive to the customer catch for groups-Christmas Eve food in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid-up by employees spread out. They do not want to be economical more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there is during the Christmas period also again the group dinner which bring to the catering industry and leisure trade of Barcelona oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis they release a prize offensive, around the also customer segment which shows the big mass to catch: Almost everybody would like to be economical between 20 and 30 euros on a midday sen or dinner, confirm the questioned enterprisers and associations.
So that the accountancy becomes still more complicated a little bit, the calendar (New Year's Eve has falls on Friday) all orders the week from the 13th of December drop, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner in two Spitzentager (16. and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before it.
Since 2008 when the bad times began many enterprises have put the group dinner for budgetary reasons.
Not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay this from her own pocket.
How the economic situation also lies always, it are demanded Niedrigstpreise, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
Till present the representative of the umbrella organisation ventures not to predict himself as the holidays will look this month.
"The people consider it 'umpteen spots, before they book."
"You would like to go out with pleasure, but they strongly pay attention to the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those, offer "the quality for good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us in the memory that the customers save in crisis periods, which is why prices are strongest asked about 25 euros.
By a survey in various centrally situated restaurants turns out that the evening of the 17th of December leads the suppliers to the collapse.
The group Soteras says, the inquiries for this Friday with the intention to be economical less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted her menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation situation.
With another leading group, Andilana which maintains 16 restaurants in the town (Hostal de la Rita Market, La Fonda and other), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the last year's prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With in Grup, the El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 bars leads, one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the income blossoms again and good ones, even if is awaited for few days of concentrated views for the Christmas business.
Springs of the enterprise group emphasise that also 18. a hyperactive day with friend's groups, the Christmas precelebrates, will be.
To six group menus a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than prize hit. One has the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the year before and as a countermove more details wish, as for example Cava.
Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This conveys the impression that group food is again in the impetus.
Vonseiten of the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with unions like the bars association, restaurant association and leisure association of Barcelona), the acting chairperson trusts to see Enric Gomà, on it the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are rather "lively all together, although the customers knock out "a maximum."
However, the fun in the celebration has not decreased, all the same who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme excites big concern in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than every other country."
Exposures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
From the Internet main entrance Wikileaks revealed contents of the correspondence between the North American message in Pakistan and the US-state department confirmed which huge worries the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington prepares.
On the edge of the clearing and juicy details which offer the documents about the contents of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad these reveal that the cooperation is not strengthened between both countries in the matter of atomic security, but on the contrary "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a quicker Rhytmus than every other country."
In particular the characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not composed, but her individual parts are stored to complicate her destruction - ready Washington sleepless nights in a possible attack.
The ambassadress counts the following risks in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former leader of the national security council, James Jones, on: "The nearness of some nuclear arrangements to the area unsound by the Taliban, the supposed Verstreuung of the nuclear material and the susceptibility of the transport of nuclear material."
The big personal number which are implied in the nuclear arsenals and the rocket programmes is not looked any more only from the USA, but also from Russia as a breaking the banks and reason to let prevail care.
"Pakistan must strictly put religious staff to the marking of the nuclear arrangements; on account of the low education and cultural levels extremist organisations have more possibilities people who co-operate in nuclear programmes or rocket programmes, to reklutieren," said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian foreign ministry in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
Anew in the documentation revealed by Julian Assang's Internet main entrance it is that the cooperation decreases between the USA and Pakistan in the matter of nuclear spreading and the raised tempo in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May is explained by an office of the message which describes the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating": "Often there is no transparency; on offers of help we receive no answers or they are rejected."
Peter Lavoy, official of the state Secret Service confirms in another communication for South Asia that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
The ambassadress Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the uppermost army leader "to clarify" general Ashfaq Kayani, to the person responsible that "army of Pakistan has to put his silent Überstützung of terrorist groups."
Auf der Jagd nach Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight the prevention of new exposures.
Interpol spends a red warning to the pursuit and location of Assange.
Everything what hangs together with Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the circumstances can be cleared up only difficultly.
Yesterday Interpol spent a "red warning" for the "location and pursuit" from Assange.
Indeed, besides, it does not concern a traditional arrangement to the arrest.
Moreover, she is not new, she comes from the 20th of November.
She also deals nothing with the last exposure of more than four millions diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse to which the Australian must position himself in Sweden.
Further assures the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police would know about where and how she can get in touch with Mr. Assange."
Already in 20. the international police authority with headquarter in Lyons (France) at the request of Sweden spent the arrangement, but it was not announced till yesterday on receipt of the competence by the Swedish authorities.
Thus lie the things. 188 Interpol countries depend to identify Assange and to discover "to arrest him provisionally and to deliver."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries after statements of the organisation look at the red warning as a charter for an Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they order of a bilateral delivery agreement how it is the case of Sweden and England where Assange presumably stays.
The action outraged Assanges lawyers who published gesten a letter in which they informed about the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also remind of the fact that Assange applied for the crossing the border from Sweden and is compared by the state lawyer, with sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security boss of Stalin, which received suitable approval.
"This is like a hunt, not like a juridical pursuit," it is accused in the writing.
While the world searches him - and his mother protests the innocence of her son from Australia - Assange stays at an unknown place, indeed, not in silence.
On Monday he gave to the leader of the magazine Time by Skype of an uncertain place from an interview. In the conversation he applied for the resignation of the Assistant Secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If can be proved that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats, to spy out UN and with it has offended against international agreements signed by the USA, she would have to withdraw," he said.
Yesterday his opinion was condemned by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation as "ridiculously and absurdly."
"I am not sure, why we should think highly of the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama itself has instructed a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new document exposures.
The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention stands in contrast to the opinions which conservative politicians and annotators announce during these days.
The congressman Peter King who will be in the chair in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the chamber of deputies from January has asked the state department to examine the possibility, to place Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate their money and everybody which supports them or a contribution performs to pursue."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had still gone on, and he had to revoke his statement, Assange must "be murdered."
"Obama would have to transform him into a target and use a not manned airplane or something like that."
Who did not apologise, was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Who was it also always which allowed to trickle through in the government information, he is guilty of the betrayal and everything is what no execution, is eiine too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter fox terrier.
Puigcercós searches with a winking to the Carod being close peace in the ERC
The republican leader permits a confidential vote about his continued existence in the office to the party.
Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription to go to the 0th time of an internal turmoil in the rows after the loss of 11 representatives and half of the votes for aimless ERC from the way.
The party leader is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient for the being close of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that today the influence of this sector is so weakened as will not give her mentor and to him the same brainwork, how other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra with a winking tries to win the new critics what would protect his position up to the next local elections.
Yesterday for the beginning told in that to more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could express themselves on his remaining in the office secretly.
With electoral slips of paper, not with high hand.
If the Carodisten to the Präsidenen wanted to miss a ticket, they could do this without having to fear repressive measures.
Really the boss would like to avoid the impression of splitting as well as from submission under his person.
He confirmed in several interviews, he would feel not confirmed with half of the voices plus, and he added without information of percent values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not feel well.
The Carod being close demand of the president more, than to make available his office only to the party. An insufficient gesture, because Puigcercós controls the uppermost organ of the congresses.
But because they do not dispose of a sufficient majority to the forcing of resignations, they will agree with the board of directors on an action plan from now till May.
For it they expect, in the elaboration of the document about strategical reorientation that the management in 18. will present to the advice for the vote to be able to help.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. As a countermove this should promise to bring forward the congress the autumn, 2011 what holds the party leadership already for a fact.
The party leader of the ERC is of the view, the "Polyphonie" a pity of the stability and he aims one for all spot at bringing the organisation in the situation, at washing her dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense the article which the acting Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his Blog is symptomatically.
In view of that, the Puigcercós an ideologist is, the owner of Innovació held it for a fact that the party leader is supported "in the exchange against different aims."
He enumerated five from which two are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that of these at least 90 percent of the party members represents that the inclusion of new faces from Carods is called sphere.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests, ERC should give up the plenary assembly principle as a functionality, finally.
With it he defends of a reform of the statutes which should enable the congresses to hold with elective delegates.
From the ending of the plenary assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' a team which already fought on the last both congresses for it, as obsessed.
Really the party leadership with the examination of the plenary assembly principle on a congress which should deal with the reformation of the statutes was instructed on the shaking meeting of 2008.
This appointment still is pending, because infogle of the internal Aufruhe of the last years beginning this matter was not advisable.
Now, without critical sectors on the lukewarm lie, if the time could have come to take up this matter again and to conclude for good.

China holds his aims for the decrease the greenhouse gas straight
The representative of China explained on the COP16, his country has undertaken huge strains for the reduction of the carbon tracks and it would maintain his offer to diminish 40 to 45 percent of his greenhouse gas till 2020.
China holds his offer to reduce the issue of hothouse gases up to 2020 about 40 to 45 percent, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th world climate summit of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have undertaken huge strains for the lowering of the carbon tracks and for the conversion of his industry.
He explained that during the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to lower the issue of hothouse gases.
However, he explained that China did not change his aims, but together with the international community would work on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy divides itself into four aspects in the matter of climate change: Dialogue, construction of capacities, construction of institutions and support of pilot's programmes.
In all aspects one has made progress, he explained including the discharge of a new energy law last year which contains the aims concerning the lowering of the issue of gases.
On the other hand, he emphasised that in China the authorities of the federal states had worked together with those of the central state and the municipalities to reach the aims to the energy saving, an effective use of the energy and the reduction from issues.
Moreover, he explained, some several years' plans have already been tackled or been concluded, those which were financed by the Chinese government, as well as those which received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme to the effective use of energy which was introduced during the last five years and had received investments of the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
A project at provincial level also runs to the climate change, another for the exchange of the traditional light bulbs by energy savings pears and another to the assuagement and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser in the matter of climate change in this country, confirmed that the strains of China are by far bigger than generally would be accepted.
He indicated that the pro-head issue of hothouse gases amounts to six tonnes per person in China, while there are 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a 9-percent whole contribution to the environmental pollution.
Also it makes unprecedented progress in the area of the energetic use. The energy effectiveness was raised during the last five years by twenty percent and up to 2020 a next should happen, he explained.
Legaler Ausschluss Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained, the former panistische party leader has to turn to the right to the national ordinal commission and to demand this what would concede the right to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legally and which the former party leader of the PAN the right has to turn to the national ordinal commission and to demand this what would concede the right to him.
During an interview which took place before the complaint guidance Gabino Cué Monteagudos as a governor of the federal state he explained, the exclusion Espinos is a decision which has been made at local level.
"It concerns an independent decision of the ordinal commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to turn to de orders del Consejo Nacional in his case above the complaint way to the Comisión, so that a decision is made by a responsible place," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it is not to be thought in the time of 2012 and that an alliance has never sat to the presidential candidates in the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was persuaded of the fact that Acción Nacional would arise from the internal vote in coming 4th and 5th of December by which his successor is chosen.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a subject which never was on the negotiating table, at least not till present. It concerned a Vorschlaag for the local choice, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panistische leader explained that the PAN on 71 years of dialogue look back, therefore, "the internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary "we enjoy them and she strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the advice needs certainly him or the best chairperson, the Acción Nacional for the next three years, would select. Therefore, he would hand over the Stafette "to that which the advice would determine."
"I am quite unconcerned there and open. I would be proud to transfer the office of the party leader to every of Five."
He forecast which will be reflected registered impetus of the party in the next elections by the last elections from the 4th of July, although "it is not in the time to think of 2012."
"Now it goes therefore of supporting the governor Gabino Cué with his job."
In this connection he emphasised that three governments who arose from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa carry the flag and were observed in the whole country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When he is questioned about the criticism of the PRI of the president Felipe Calderón because of his Diskkurses within the scope of his four-year-old government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to think about the 6-year-old period of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI think that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than from fox terrier and Calderón, they should start to defend, finally, they, should come they from the cupboard," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion, that the owner of the Federal Government expressions like that whom he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral ban and still less a censorship.
Obama exerts itself in Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are for the discharge of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press for the discharge of this law," twitterte the president of the United States in the popular social net.
Today the president Barack Obama supported the national mobilisation to the support of the Dream Act - law of the legalisation of undocumented students with news on his personal Blog in the social net Twitter.
"If you are for the discharge of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press for the discharge of this law," twitterte Obama.
His short communication contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document which asks the public to step unterzüglich with her senators in contact, because the vote of the law approaches immediately.
"With your voice for which we wait the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was spread, after 42 republican senators threatened to block all voice for every law, except the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade which was announced on a letter signed by 42 republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects like the ratification of the new start agreement with Russia against the spreading of nuclear weapons.
About the blockade of the Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects questioned, said the presidency speaker Robert Gibbs, he trusts in the fact that if once the tax subject is solved a schedule can be put up for the remaining projects.
"I believe, we still have a lot of time..."
"Everybody we agree in the fact that the tax matter must be unwound before end of the year..."
"I think that we can meet about that any time an arrangement and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The chairperson of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, told on Tuesday in, "he would apply for the vote with end of the debate," so that the Dream Act - the law with which the initiative for the legalisation of undocumented students can be tuned from the next Thursday in the senate although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would become about 800,000 young people who immigrated in the United States when they were still sixteen years old none, while to the last five years have lived in this country and into a higher educational institution or with the army are enrolled, legalise.
But the advocates of the law need for the discharge of the initiative sixty voices, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At the moment the organisations of the advocates of this project organise an intensive influencing control on the discharge of the law.
The democrats from whom support the majority the Dream Act order more than 58 seats.
Indeed, said one of them who would be right senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several Republicans on her side, if other democrats should decide to turn the back towards the initiative.
To the mostly sought-after Republicans belong from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida who took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez.
The other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared not to support it with another opportunity any more.
Another Republican who had expressed himself for the law John McCain, has not fixed his position up to now yet.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree in the fact which stands the Dream Act in the senate before the biggest obstacles.
With literature lay the finger in the wound
The second round of the 'desire in the language' was a walk with which the participants made themselves for the story strong
"With the sex into language I understand, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected from me?," asked the author Luisa Valenzuela who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle which celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used with this opportunity the subtitle of her question (on another event was dedicated the round table to the sex into language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in difficulties," spitted the Argentine written steles sweetly to the audience which consisted primarily of young people who gathered on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to be present at this round table presented by Marisol Shultz, in the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read out a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and marked the Shultz afterwards as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is to be found out on the search what is a "wound," and from doctor to doctor goes from which she receives though no answer, but tips for the guide of her story.
She leaves the Infektologen persuaded: "Patience is not my strength, is maybe my wound."
In the end, after a frustrating approach to the Traumatologen which robbed of the breath her in the middle on the way, and to which you explain, however, that wound is no scientific concept, enthült of the psychoanalysts the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolism is the scar."
The central figure of the story sighs made easier and closes which she only found out "from the wound that this is really open and does not exist." But she is persuaded that the desire in the language and their traps mix.
Valenzuela, the author, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story which he called 'praise of the invention' and in which the finger does not mention in the wound though, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magic realism he tells about a famous magician who brought back the clouds touched, widely travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made an about-turn and reported about America, the big novel which did not lack from the outset his own chroniclers, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the abundance of the stories told about the conquering.
"Cervantes which invited everybody (the authors to us) mocked feigned witnesses who appeared in as true shown stories, but in other manner the history would never have been told America - with the imagination which got lost even the sense of shame."
Indeed, he emphasises, "these are the lunatics and liars who fancy the things best of all," and there reality and lie approach to each other where one does not know any more to which side the story belongs where the fictive literature reaches the summit.
He calls really the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him to be this what is told."
As a Mayra Montero in the row was, commented and praised the author on the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl for the round table 'of The fingers in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puertorikanerin dedicated her contribution of the big wound of the social power which strikes her country - like completely Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent not deliberately planned engagement," she explained, after she had emphasised that literature is a communication and obligation which are based between the author and the readers like with a "chemical reaction."
The Spanish writer Lui García Montero, contribution decided the evening also "this finger of the engaged author in the wound of the author" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-moving world also the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness run out to dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation a small no stands and behind every denial small Yes."
"To be our thought and the reality in the possession, we must nuance: And nuancing often indicates to lay the finger in the wound and to bother those which feel much finer if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in precast ideas without nuances and also of bothering the powerful figures who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noted and loaded in addition the sense to rediscover of the writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played determining plays.
Moreover, in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey with the final two different, from her respective trainers given styles are confronted, and their meeting marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had determining plays, and up to now he has kept himself good, which is why this opportunity of quite special importance for him is.
The Argentine has himself with the medallion to the second champion hochgespielt, he has stayed behind 1 step behind the winners and surprisingly he has delivered with the same team of successive finals.
The santistische strategist reached the first final as a trainer with the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he got to know against Toluca with a big defeat 4-2; later, with the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the determining duel which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' with whom they played Diablos against lot Rubén had to pocket a setback again, because the play with went out 2-2 against lot Choriceros after 210 play minutes undecided, but with the 11 metre he made progress with 3-1 and got two possibilities to pocket his title, but, in the end, three his players missed eleven steps and the play turned to 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore, he would not like to be pursued once again by the misfortune and escape from the bad magic to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he confirms that for him the most important is the play itself.
"I would like to become a champion, I would like to break no statistics, this is for a club, for my affection to which I dedicate myself, and, therefore, the title will come to me, but what happens before, is the most important," commented the coxswain when one questions him about the lost finals.
The last final has still strongly been remembered to him, has assured he to have learnt a lot from it: "The only apprenticeship which we can pull from it is that to the referee the end does not whistle, we cannot celebrate, we in the line are prepared, the players also, because the last spot we were prepared with two 11 metres already to retire, and I think that this is an apprenticeship, until the play is not finished, there is no occasion for the celebration."
To know that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never wants to come with the penalty shoot-out, one would like to conclude in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and one must be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, unfortunately, the destiny prepared for us a bad play, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the violent aspiration to hold the title already in the hands this something left us for this final, and we hope that it will not come this spot in addition."
There lies in Romanso power not to be the only second champion any more and to cost for the first time the fame which the titles with themselves bring.
The USA changes the rules for the preservation of a visa
The people must fancy before her conversation at the consulate at the service places to the visa application; costs will become waiting periods so shortened.
From the 10th of January, 2011 the procedures change to the application of a visa in the message of the United States and in the consulates.
With the new procedure most applicants must fancy before her conversation in the consulate at the service places to the visa application (ASC, the initial letters on English).
The staff of the ASC takes up the biometrical data of the applicant which are checked by the consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the candidates, count to it:
The total expenses for the winding up of the visa sink, because it is not any more necessarily the appointment arrangement, the treatment of the visa application and the transport services with which the document is handed over to pay apart.
The applicant makes only one single payment which covers three services.
The present price remains unchanged: the Gegenwerit to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for Händer and investors.
Those which only would like to extend her visa must carry on no conversation in the consulate, they must imagine only with nächstliegenden ASC where they present her documents and her fingerprints are taken.
Because the biometrical data are caught up in the ASC, the applicants who need the second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than earlier.
Those which apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must not pay the service impact of 26 dollars any more.
You find additional information about the new procedure to the visa application in the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
The NASA announces the finding of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called up a press conference, around a finding tomorrow preblocks which will have effects on the search for living being in all.
Tomorrow the national aerial authority and space agency (NASA) of the United States announces, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
Tomorrow the finding is introduced at 13.00 o'clock in a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington by experts of the astrobiology. Besides, it concerns a science which examines the origin, the development, the distribution and the future of life in the universe.
By conscription of the press conference assured the NASA, she will introduce "a supervision-exciting finding for the search for extraterrestrial life" what released speculations with experts of other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in the hostile surroundings which one held up to now for unbwohnbar manlike creatures. The hypothesis was thrown up that these could change into intelligent living beings - as well as people - if her living conditions improved.
Apparently it concerns a microbe which was found on the basis of the Mono brine in the Yosemite-national park, California. She lives there in surroundings which were held for too toxic for all conceivable life forms, because the lake is very arsenic-containing.
Somehow the arsenic uses the Mikrobie as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability increase the chances that there could be similar life on other planet which do not dispose of our protecting atmosphere.
If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, is proved according to the astrobiologists that "there is actual another life form, the second life form which differs from to us of the known ones."
Tomorrow the space agency announces, on Thursday, in the press conference the actual reach of her finding.
In the conference take part the geobiologist Pamela Conrad who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and which studies biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the titanium (the biggest moon of Saturn) under the question whether his chemical composition resembles that of the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia und Patrón bilden einen Oppositionsblock
With the reform of the organ law about the congress the two-party system is introduced, they deplore.
Just the 60th legislative period had begun, and an opposition block, stated by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo who fancied as an independent already installed itself. Four questioned follower: the move of the 'two-party system' in the chamber.
Before the beginning of the introduction meeting in the 60th legislative period railed Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, because they would be thereby excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now these would be two people, the same number like parties who controlled the congress.
These four representatives, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, co-ordinator of the PRD, were the only ones which tuned Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdena Fonseca in his quality as an acting chairperson cited presidium against from the Panisten.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties had introduced PRI and PAN with these reforms institutionally her political edge position.
He explained that they spoke during the next days with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern. Besides, they went out from derem political will and if they did not have him, they would be subjugated by both parties again with which of the opposition coalition an end would be put.
"Here I come (the opposition coalition), this is that what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they not even take on it Rücksichte to consider the opinion of the remaining ones."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia explained, there would be correspondence with PRD, PT and Patrón and that, therefore, a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that the congress, after he was monopolistic, should be now "duopolistisch."
"It is not the mind of the law reform that in the congress an everlasting two-party system should rule."
"For the beginning this group begins with five representatives and they speak with other colleagues and colleagues, so that they become more," explained the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained in allusion on PAN and PRI that the congress has changed at the moment into a 'prey' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split to themselves this in twos."
Patrón Montalvo applied to respect the representatives and to assign to them her place in the negotiating tables.
"It may not be let go in front on the basis of top decisions five which will probably be nine representatives outside. Five which are seen split at the moment as in different groups have decided to unite to take our place in the negotiating table, because on account of him the reform which was carried out by the other and was arranged we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200,000 pesos more for the "supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays an other cheque to the argumentative owner of the enterprise for electric material.
Another cheque about a little bit more than 200,000 pesos in favour of from Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was drawn by the city administration.

Tourist places must penetrate are improved
Tour operators regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the bad state of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the burglary of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada the tourism branch of Mazatlán applied at the authorities, areas which are in a bad state and throw a bad picture on the port to give special attention.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairperson of the trader's association of the Zona Dorada, reminded of the fact that was demanded to different opportunities to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions which the tourists find, into new possibilities of employment or routes.
He said, the bad state of the streets and sidewalks would have affected negatively, because the tourists would come for sauntering and would see the mess, whereupon they would turn to the nearby stores the back.
"The politicians do not know what indicates to have to close an enterprise one day and they attack no thoughts how much money one loses. Since otherwise they would not carry out the construction work in this manner slowly and desultorily."
The hotel proprietor José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said, the fall of the tourist would have drawn the attention to the missing prevention and the being missing Instandhaltungsarbeitung vonseiten of the town.
"The municipality must take over her responsibility and avoid which happens such a thing once again. How should she do this? To mend afterwards now, by a preventive servicing instead of everything," he explained.
"We wait longingly to have a clean town. Since not only because it concerns a tourism area, it must be kept in good condition, also we inhabitant have a right on a clean living space. The city administration must change her strategy to receive the town in a good state."
"There are other places which look also neglected and incomplete," he said, "beispielsweise el Escudo y el Venadito von Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than only advertisement to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, he complemented a town which holds her beaches and streets cleanly, and the tourist attractions constantly in shot."
"Enough attention was not given to these precautions and this kind of incidents show up this what is evident for everybody: A maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, untersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how importantly it is to be saved the tourist places by Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and let arise a bad picture.
He mentioned a row of places which would have to be brought together with the town on person in front. To form the town cleanly, substantially and attractively for the tourism, should be priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites which would have to be cleared up first once and would be cleaned to make them for the tourism attractive and to supply them to the inventory with which we advertise to this destination.
IP demands results of the congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairperson of the CCE, suggested, the representatives should take over the big responsibility, a model for a better Sinaloa which is before many challenges to deliver.
The enterprise branch of Mazatlán demands a worthy parliament, freely of arrangements zwiwchen to the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is turned up and stands before big problems.
Yesterday the 60th parliament was initiated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 representatives of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another one of PVEM. This makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
From the new members of the state congress it is expected that they make a clean work, feel to the society and the different social groups obliged which depend on a responsible parliament work, and that the same patterns of partiality and Paternalismus do not recur.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairperson of the enterpriser's coordination advice CCE, suggested, the new representatives should take over the big responsibility, a model for a better Sinaloa which is before many challenges to deliver.
"We hope that the representatives really use her right to act freely from arrangements between the parties, because it is usual that they meet arrangements with which they represent her own interests with which they change into carnival extra of the governing and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He spoke of the fact that they should prove her engagement to the construction of the necessary bridges to the Unterstüztung of the present government.
"We look after the fact that they explain a trustworthy work and exert themselves before all things for the society and their groups, because these were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who pronounced her trust to them by the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairperson of the hotel association of Tres Islas, means, one of the big challenges to which 40 representatives of the people face is the impulse and the common works for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation extreme ones would be complicated.
"The most important is that they drive the economic growth, investments incentives and infrastructure measures create what will promote the creation of jobs in a manner at all."
In view of the tourism branch he demanded of the new representatives, they should assign for the support to the tourism ministry the necessary value in the state household.
"I have understood that it is the ministry with the second-least means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity which brings foreign currency and investments in the country and stands in direct competition to the agroindustry."
Money must be assigned to the tourist projects, the state security must become support and the alcohol law which was not caught in the preceding legislative periods anew, must be brought on the newest state.
Holy king is searched
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela longingly.
For the parents it will be difficult on the next Epiphany day to fulfil these wishes, because the household does not consist any more and no less than of twelve people and a billy goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toys and the clothes for which they long so.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. They live on the hand in the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Hard times are sometimes announced because my husband has no job. But we sell tangerines and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out into the streets with the little misses to the selling," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would have with pleasure a doll or a bicycle, while her three year-old sister Isabel wishes a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo would already like to have since some time a 'monster carriage' and for his eight month-old little brother Jesús Cayetana clothes suggests in the size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said me, 'I would have so with pleasure this monster', but I answered to him, 'lets to us wait, boy', because it was very expensive," remembered Cayetana sadly.
For the older children who were at school clothes and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaías the size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel Grösse 8 has.
14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you liked to help to realise the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can make a donation in the campaign 'holy king will take part in request', while you toys or cash in the receipt hall of the newspaper Noroeste.

Besides, fourteen people were arrested and will be confronted with different accusations.
The house searches played themselves in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke from, at the places should have served mainly the drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment which have served the production have been confiscated," bragged Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the state police of Quebec.
All together eleven men and three women were arrested from whom two of the men who are valid as a main wire-puller of the drug ring come from Sherbrooke.
The arrested people should already have appeared hours after her arrest before the justice building in Sherbrooke.
Among the rest, they could be accused of the accusation of the production by cannabis, possession for sales purposes, the plot as well as the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a protracted investigating activity which proceeded about a 1 year.
"The information preserved from public hand has enabled to us to carry out these arrests," specified M. Ruel.
Around 70 policemen of the regional inquiry unity Estrien of the state police of Quebec, the police service to Sherbrooke as well as the police authority of Memphrémagog had taken part in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued easily
The law draught of the conservatives whom according to the government the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants should regulate will be pulped in all probability, after three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot recommend the proposal.
"I rebel with stress against this charter."
"I hold with a party which has laid chains to the feet to you," explained Michael Ignatieff, boss of the liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting before the gathered representative.
The liberals stated, the law draught which allows to hold on each of one as to the transport of unlawful immigrants identified sea ship the coming person up to during 1 year injures as well as suggested the Canadian legal constitution and freedom constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, boss of the Bloc Québécois, indicated also not to be able to support the law draught, because he turns against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait what undertakes the government," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism concerning the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed the critics who demand, her party would not behave firmly enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree with the fact that one takes measures against the blind passengers, and just this we try to put through through another law draught, C-35,," Chow stated.
Hence, we do not recommend the law draught of the conservatives because he searches the guilt with the refugees and holds prisoner children at least during 1 year," explained Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with the politics and of ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians inform of the representative urgently that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal processes which concern Canada and which treat the country like a foot doormat."
"You expect that Canada takes hard measures," according to the reaction minister Kenney.
"The government has announced no vote of confidence with regard to her law draught which could have led the country to elections which would have rejected the government.
Nevertheless, a conservative has expressed compared with the agency QMI, the government would call up a vote, so that every opposing representative explains himself immediately towards his voters.
The new unity finds no unanimity
In spite of the announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unity to the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest numerous observers demand furthermore the education of a public committee of inquiry on this subject.
Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, states, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would already have consulted the last January the New York Department of Investigation with regard to this subject.
The metropolis disposes since 1870 of a standing unity against the corruption.
Still, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than only one.
One must say to the fact that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the constant committee of the Quebecer police service was discussed on the 29th of October of the last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils not in the slightest.
There was also not enough that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement qualified tinkered solution" in punkto public security as a "rabbit conjured from the hat" as well as "in a serving rightly.
Minister Dutil had turned on his part again to those which fear that the political power has too much influence on the standing, future unity.
"You will see the result if we announce it," he was content to confirm himself.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can substitute for the realisation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest persists to want to prevent the education of this committee of inquiry, the more the people will think like you and me that he has to hide something," he explained.
"To be able to form the only means, a committee of inquiry, is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics systems explained on his part in the ENA (staatl. College to the education of high administrative officials).
To come out of this dead end, he suggests to Quebec putting away a special mandate for the finance check control, so that this can make suitable inquiries about corruption and confidential arrangements.
"One should be able to expand the mandate of the exam control," he decided.
He represents also the opinion that Quebec of the exam control could put away the same power like commissioners what would also allow to her to oblige the people to the statement.
The education of a standing unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government of Charest.
Quebec will also require from Ottawa to change from that point of view the penal law to be put better in this way by crime.
This inquiry comes from the upper public prosecutor of the operation Marteau who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier about the fact that the administration of justice is not unequivocal in this kind of the criminal proceedings.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public security confirmed on his part, his colleague of the justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment argues with determined, this dossier to concerning amendments.
During the operation Printemps in 2001 which concerned the groups of the motorcycle policemen 131 people had been arrested, although the penal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has put through the law against world of gangsters as a result of that.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several courses of a river remain on account of the high precipitation which has poured forth since Tuesday in some regions of the province, furthermore under strict marking.
It came to Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, on the Wednesday afternoon to a landslide.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide has occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
Besides, a street has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday on Wednesday evening strong rainfall of 40 up to 70 milliliters of precipitation on several regions has poured forth.
Between from 20 to 40 other millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions to Thursday evening.
The areas to the north of the river as well as the valley of the region of Outaouais were strongest concerned.
Here had come down all together up to 100 millimetres of shower.
Because to this precipitation still the thaw is to be included which has already collected in certain branches, violating several watercourses is feared.
On the Wednesday evening warning tips about the high water alarm were exclaimed by the Quebecer security concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The courses of a river in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentinischen to mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become here the object of the high water supervision and also remain furthermore under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière the violent precipitation has passing some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as also in Rawdon caused.
In Saint-Calixte an evasive bridge was torn away on account of the strong rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais violating certain lakes has the closing of several streets, caused in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security remains furthermore on the alert and supervises the situation most exactly, according to security council member Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer land high water centre has published on his part on Wednesday warning tips of the strong Ansteigens of several rivers, in particular from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly reprimanded
The Quebecer broadcasting company presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcasting company norms (CCNR) because of his controversial statements of social care and Haitian just as because of his abusive manner of speech on radio a partial setback.
The CCNR represents the opinion, M. Though Dupont and his 98,1-FM team CHOI would have the right on own expression of opinion, indeed, certain statements would have contained "inexact information about the social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as also a so coarse manner of speech which is not measured for the broadcastings emitted during the day."
The supervisory board had also final-concluded that have committed a discussion about the suicide which contains the spreading of the names of two people the suicide, offends against the code of the broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several discomfort concerning during in the period from 2008 and 2010 to emitted broadcastings to made comments.
The first possession was inserted as a result of a complaint of "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist's organisation had complained that the amounts called in the broadcasting are inexact.
The presenters should give rather solidly as delusive information.
Concerning the subject Suicide presenter Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion, the suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the provided message is, on this occasion, that suicide may not be looked as a solution by crises.
"The majority of the supervisory board considers that the standing results of the broadcasting "Dupont le midi" would have broached a sensitive subject in suitable way appropriate for family."
Hence, he was booked with no reprimand towards his person.
The last contentious issue concerned the statements which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-oriented quarrel conversation to themselves concerning this that an amount from reactions has caused.
The CHOI presenter had declared not to have made a donation in favour of the Haiti help, because one would know not with certainty whether the destitute also received really the cash donations.
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these comments have not been of abusive character that, nevertheless, her cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already atoned for my 3-day suspension punishment in this thing."
"My act is maiden for one and a half years," explained the presenter.
In all decisions prangert the supervisory board the spreading of a coarse mode of expression in.
In all cases CHOI FM of broadcasting company announcers has acted "beyond his obligations."
The consequences for the radio station which should inform, among the rest, of his decisions unique during the prime time within a term of three days are slight.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, has shaped quite a special course.
Now the athlete who impresses in "Sanda" (full contact kung fu), in the kick boxing as well as in the Thaiboxen rises in the search for new challenges on the action Yank and in the box rings of the world.
"I have begun 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts like kung fu and kick boxing," explained Zemmal which is resident since 2008 in the metropolis to develop among the professionals.
I search personally the fight everywhere, because for those which do not like the ground combat, as him the mixed fight arts present arms, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently that of his sign as a security man working as well as at the company UPS had given hired news bad to his rival in which he gained two gold medals of the World karate as well as the Kickboxing association (WKA) with between the 23rd and 30th of October in Edinburgh, Scotland, delivered world championship of the amateurs.
"I have gained the victory in the categories of the full contact of kick boxing and the Thaiboxens," he explained.
"At the moment I prepare for the world cup in the San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from every category who had placed themselves with the last world championship under the first four had been invited."
"Ich dribbles 2009 in Toronto Bronze geholt."
"In 2005 I have become in Vietnam an eight."
"In 2007 I have finished the tournament in China on the fifth place, while I have become a third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become this spot or next year a first!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are from China coming disciplines with which punches and kicks just as ground throws are allowed.
The duels ordinarily happen on a platform, more seldom in a box ring.
The most famous box fighter who has arisen from this kind of the fight sport is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le who is well-known in the world of the fight arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal keep back only onto one single event in his career, he would call here with certainty his presence in the super-tournament "King of Sanda," Really Bowl of the kung fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and in China most respectable," explained the likeable great guy.
"It is a little bit like the recompense to the stadium of Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand)."
"This was a super-experience."
Zemmal had won in the semi-final of his category (80 kg) his first fight, before he lost then in the finale.
"That who has defeated me was a real pro," he analysed.
"There are four comrades-in-arms per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet in each case in the finale of her category."
"Then the winners of every category offer themselves the forehead to crown one single champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 millions in contracts without advertising
Hydro québec has granted in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 Millions dollars in contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a syndicate, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe N.M. and Axor which has received the most important portion, namely those of the project management, to a sum from 295 million dollars without advertising.
This syndicate, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a concomitant of the decision by Hydro québec, the private sector her responsibilit, this important, hydroelektrische project by height of a sum of 5 milliard dollars to überantworten.
In the beginning of 2005 the syndicate "Énergie gérance" got hold of the lucrative contract, without there would have been a public advertising.
For the Parti Québécois falling back on enterprise syndicates poses a serious ethical problem which brings on the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a prize increase.
"This is a new way of a snare and weakens the competition."
"This means that one carries out instead of snares instead of in confidential way now in open form," yesterday explained Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, in the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon to it, while she denied vehemently that it would have concerned with this contract a snare.
"I remain loyal to my line," railed them, while it encouraged, the PQ has gone forward "dishonestly" and "she lacks hardness."
She said, it "is the least" that the PQ apologise.
The model of the syndicate is worldwide a current practise.
It usually concerns a chronologically so limited alliance which allows to two or several enterprises to bundle up her expert's assessments concerning an order on an advertising for a complicated project.
The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level with regard to his working magnitude.
The construction method is going and should be put up till 2012.
Anyhow the contract was awarded, without a competition had been able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
Besides, the model of the syndicate in Quebec even with relatively easy projects shows by no means more an exception.
How the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted the last week, applied model of the syndicate is in the area of the structural engineer and consultation being an object of government inquiries.
Short flying of the Quebecer enterprise register allows to name more than 200 syndicates from which some of continual duration seem to be.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of her nuclear competitors to whom CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult count.
Any linking, and of it returns it to several dozens, introduces on and the same legal entity, namely on Dessau.
What concerns the syndicate "Énergie gérance," minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James of a special manpower dynamism is subjected and that Hydro québec gives to this fact since the 70s in special way calculation."
Réal Laporte, the big employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a declaration which has the nose about the fact rümpfen leave that the contract about the project management was granted after arrangement.
"If you an advertising makes and gives it only few applicants, upwards your prices will shoot up."
"You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this Mart and says you: one will negotiate an adequate arrangement for a good price."
"Nevertheless, the thought is that not the price is vital, but the expertise of the people," sanctioned Laporte.
This contract allowed to the syndicate "Énergie gérance" is a part of a long list of contracts about more than 50,000 dollars preserved by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After examination the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and adviser contracts, the companies or their branches, under it in particular resource labs, between 2002 and March, 2010 were granted.
SNC-Lavalin had heaped 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting, on this occasion, their participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They amount in Whole to 449.783.344$, in it enclosed the contract with "Énergie gérance" more than 295.131.564$.
Sylvain Simard left that four companies who form the syndicate (BPR are Dessau, Groupe N.M. and Axor) of the "Parti libéral you québec well-known."
Minister Normandeau left, the PQ would be equally connected with the companies whom they "financed," before she specified that it concerns rather their executives.
Barometre to verantworungsbewußten consumptions - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Green, but point-blank doubtfully.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main actors of the lasting growth, however, just as little to the marked brands or the ecological markings which should steer his choice.
It is a pity, although it has a bath in a media-oriented universe where it is swarming with information in favour of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometre to responsible consumptions has to deplore a lack of plausible information, an inadequacy which marks itself as a brake of his engagement, as the first reading pointed which was held yesterday.
Although they have sped up the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecer still seem to those which try to sell this to give little loan.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population admits giving, indeed, to the environmental engagement of the companies to just as little faith like the green enterprise advertisement, ingenious measuring instrument betrays from the responsible consumer centre of the university of Sherbrooke.
Another findings: half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the official, to the putatively fair products to added certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands which declare themselves as environment-conscious, according to the barometre.
After the same pattern the discourse of the politicians is taken seriously on this subject of only 14.6% of the Quebecer population.
Anyhow the information concerning responsible consumptions seems importantly to the stimulation of this consumption segment which is animated at the moment by roughly only one third of the Quebecer consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious character of the information damped the zeal of 46% of the consumers.
This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified on the part of the barometre.
Moreover, there faces one third of the Quebecer of the given efficiency of the green products and services which one tries hard to lay to them to the hand distrustfully.
According to another communication had already changed about half of the consumers in 2010 her habits and mainly had changed the brand of one or several products to give expression to her conviction.
According to barometre they had also preferred to 61% of purchases with traders of her town quarter and had favoured the purchase of food tilled in her region.
Green and more responsibly - the index of the environment-conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value from 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as a king of the recycling who tries to reduce his tracks hinterlassenen in the environment, while he looks after the protection of animals.
However, the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop at his car, according to the barometre: just 28% of the Quebecer have bragged, in 2010 have used public means of transportation or the agency for arranged lifts to have preferred to demonstrate her ecological interest.
The Zufußgehen as well as the bicycle driving were also recommended from 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey which feeds the stereotype images.
State loan for the takeover from eXcentris
The Quebecer government which was asked by the Société to Angus as well as the enterprise of Parallèle to take part financially in the takeover of the film complex eXcentris agrees with a cooperation, however, only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developer society Angus as well as the enterprise of Parallèle which had hoped for a donation at the rate of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Education and the Arts for the takeover of Daniel Langlois of belonging film complex eXcentris in the boulevard Saint-Laurent, around this again of his real cinematic function to überantworten, preserved apparently not what they have required.
Though the government has accepted to involve itself in this thing, indeed, to her own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in lower than the at first expected height which could bring to life a solution able to exist to advantageous conditions at least according to opinion of the springs entnehmbaren from the state rumour kitchen.
The first action plan as well as an inquiry after 12.8 millions have been already rejected the last spring of Quebec, the petition was corrected since once more according to sum down.
Ein Vorschlag zusammen put einem Aktionsplan wurden bereits vom Präsidenten der "Society of development of the cultural firms" (SODEC), François Macerola, year Ministerin St-Pierre gesendet, die die Akte eXcentris leitet.
Several days ago he had her one last material report hand over.
The alternative suggestion of the cabinet was transmitted of the SODEC, nevertheless, on Wednesday.
Now Parallèle and Angus have time up to the 31st of December to answer this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have been pushed really aside.
If we call ourselves in recollection that the Quebecer owner's community of the cinemas and film complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment to the support of the takeover from eXcentris, while she brought forward the argument, the minister of education and the arts has to provide no financial assistance to real estate projects there which he also to other film halls does not have hand over.
Nevertheless, several other market participants of the segment sued by contrast for substantial, economic help.
Film boss Daniel Langlois had presented after the own-financed construction of the cinema more than ten years under big difficulties the author's cinema in the rooms of his film complex what could justify the exceptional position on the part of the treasury.
The lack of the film halls which show independent films is in Montreal more than obviously, and eXcentris his clientele knew how to hold with the pole.
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise of Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the head, head for their part for a privately financed Campagne from which they hope for a sum 700,000$ to start the acquisition.
Since the spring, 2009 only one single canvas continues showing films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to open three film halls on the 27th of February of the next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux" anew.
However, Christian Yaccarini has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and has ignored one what he and his group of the down corrected proposals hold which one has made to them.
Secret of complicated-shaken Canada ventilated
The new, American diplomat's pipelines which were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret about what the United Nations judge under the inferiority complex of the Canadians towards the Americans; however, they disclose the sense of superiority last-named towards Canada with the same blow.
Consequently the American diplomats have surprised at the fact that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations for the purposes of with the ballot, and they think that the visit of president Obama had helped the conservative government to put through her budget of 2009!
Four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington which were spread yesterday publicly offer even more piquant details than the bare substantial contents at which one has to nibble.
A connection dating from the 22nd of September, 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage were located in the full way reports about that from which point the United Nations do not take part any more in the applications discussed by her political bosses.
To the big astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkin offers different explanation possibilities of this situation.
"An inferiority complex nearly being inherent in the Canadians arranges partly possibly the Canadian, political executives a lot rather to speak of internal issues of the everyday life, than leave holding the baby the United States by this choice (how in 1988 with the campaign about the free trade) ," so he describes.
The United Nations, so he concludes, are therefore "proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but to speak potentially too menacingly, in order of him."
The ambassador understands this "ear-deafening silence" the less, because both countries look after intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," so he values, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still even more of a party chief for leading of such an essential respect which the voter has with the urn way as a key factor for the purposes of."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in on the 22nd of January, 2009 from Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, sent communication which president Barack Obama should prepare for his first visit in Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to guarantee the continued existence of the government with the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February with which Canada will announce his first deficit after more than one decade which has originated on account of a stimulation programme by the height of from 30 to 40 milliard dollars," describes Breese.
He had nowhere mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliament meeting before Christmas to prevent that the parliament would be brought down by the coalition and would affect the so conditioned continued existence of the opposition parties the quality of the suggested stimulation programme.
Next from January, 2008 dating and on the part of the ambassador Wilkin written communication informs Washington of the picture becoming more and more negatively that the dramatic series emitted about CBC of the United States spread.
The ambassador is disturbed about broadcastings like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O in which one can observe a little subtle allusions in Maher Arar, the "No Fly cunning" or also payments for the purpose from by musclemen of the CIA of carried out examinations.
Again another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clinten has asked with her French colleagues Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting for whether Europe is ready to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner should have answered the question with, indeed, on the base of an individual "case to case" decision.
Àm end of the meeting, in such a way described, "he has handed over to the state secretary a paper as regards Omar Khadr, to a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Assistant Secretary has accepted to look through the act once more."
If we still mark, finally that the minds get hot concerning the web page WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing adviser, had explained about CBC that for this massive leakage people responsible should be "killed."
He had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan to the renewal of the lighting
Yesterday UN has suggested in Cancun a plan to the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in view of the achievement of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) which corresponds nearly to one third of the additional reduction which must be realised to stabilise the earth climate till 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects which UN hopes to move in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrial countries.
After the plan proposed yesterday the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 milliard tonnes (Gt) on account of the lighting on the earth delivered FCKWs if the white-hot pears which show up to now one more monopoly of from 50 to 70% at the market were substituted with fluorescing or better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the worldwide issues.
This corresponds to a recompense of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide vehicle park.
In Copenhagen the big exhaust gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and other had themselves the last year under which also Canada counted, obliges to voluntary reduction plans which should screw off the global CFC issues of 53 Gt on 49 Gt.
One would have to depart from this balance, nevertheless, another 5 Gt to stabilise the climate increase about 2 degrees centigrade from today up to 2020 to prevent that this gets out of control.
In the white-hot pears 95% of the energy escape in the form of warmth, and remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact illuminant pears the energy consumption decreases about 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this power demand again around the double.
The compact illuminant pears hold on an average between from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, as for example those which the manufacturer Philips has put on the market this week - this society has taken part, by the way, in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-hot pear what provides an indication of the saving possibilities of the Auswechselungsplanes which should be applied in 100 countries.
Beside the fact that iese to absolutely new light bulbs deliver only very little warmth they can also function with a variable resistor.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have indicated that compact illuminant pears show reserves, because they contain mercury and that one must decontaminate them so as a hazardous waste what is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers make available a counter.
The main spring in mercury issues on the planet shows according to the report, nevertheless, not the compact illuminant pear, but rather the coal-fired power stations which expel substantially more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
Only in the United States these coal-fired power stations expel 25,000 tonnes of mercury yearly.
The report demonstrates in detail the profits which every country would gain thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would save, so for example, one milliard dollars yearly by the buying of electricity and eight million tonnes CO2, this means a recompense of 3.5 coal-fired power stations whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 milliards.
The Ivory Coast expects excitedly the announcement of the election results
UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has demanded the "prompt" publication of the results of the presidency choice of the Ivory Coast directly after their deadline.
"The secretary general underlines the need of the independent electoral commission to receive her work and to announce the temporary results without other deferment," a press agent of the UN boss stressed.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove her responsibilit and to abstain from every initiative up to the announcement of the temporary results."
In spite of the pressure exerted on the part of certain foreign governments the electoral commission had the deadline which was fixed to Wednesday at midnight, allow to pass by three days after the choice on Sunday, without Veröffentlichkung of the results.
Approximately forty minutes before deadline the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the commission "with the work continue" would become to announce the results.
On Wednesday multiple calls from the whole world have been expressed, nevertheless, the CEI may exclaim, finally, the name of the winner of the second electoral round under Laurent Gbagbo parting from the office and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
Nevertheless, the Gbagbo camp counts on the annulment of "deceitful" castings of votes in the north by the constitutional advice which were achieved by the ex rebel's camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the putsch failed in September, 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of the presidency campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the manoeuvres carried out on the part of the FN to the intimidation the voter had deterred the followers of the president in the north of the country to go for the choice.
The whole choice could be cancelled, if the complaints inlaid by Gbagbo are considered by the constitutional advice.
Now, nevertheless, the Gbagbo opponents are more of the view that the highest court of law of the country is not neutral, because he is escorted by Paul Yao N'Dré, politically closely with Gbagbo to linked ones.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north who denies every connection with the ex-rebels has judged the delay with the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect this, even if he has gone not so far of calling the victory.
His Bündnisparter confirm, Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, because he knows that he has lost; and to lodge a complaint before the constitutional court, after one has stopped the electoral commission from publishing the results, seie illegally.

"It is easy to subordinate a row of punishable charges to him, another thing is to prove this," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of AFP (Agence France press) before the hearing of his mandator.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the HP (Parti socialiste) in the department, had thought highly of it to hand over a Memoradum to his justification to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
An affiliated Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused on the Wednesday evening and was arrested.

Concerning the business competence area or the destination of the funds linked with it he would never have had knowledge, according to Simon.
In this Affaire Daniel Pinna, former general manager of the civil service of the conurbation Aubagne, on Wednesday was also accused of embezzlement and complicity, then to keep away, nevertheless, under the edition, under judicial supervision from the protagonists of this legal act, sedate again on free foot.

Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée palace exaggerates his mediator's function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July, 2009 to May, 2010, held the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held on in Iran because of "spying," the diplomacy moved the French public in breath, on the alert and accented the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
This everything under the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States.
From WikiLeaks preserved and from the newspaper "Le Monde" Looked through American documents some backgrounds of this crisis reveal.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans his strategy who went so far of giving this advice to the contact with her own crisis of "taking of hostages" in Iran (a small group of travellers).
They indicate as the French people responsible have tried to persuade Washington of the fact that the freeing of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, one in France held prisoner and from the American justice on the basis of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme of Iranian in request to the Gegeleistung.
Finally, they put the way with which the French presidium has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose to make to these the idea plausible, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role by the freeing from Clotilde Reiss, in a garish light.
In truth he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat's telegramme edited 12th of August, 2009 in Paris carries the title "Iran: French comments to the way of the contact with taking of hostages."
François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, talked in company of Patrice Paoli, manager of the dock d'Orsay for North Africa and middle East to the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to risk everything, around her own citizens rückzuführen who would be held on by force in Iran.
"Power of noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without respite" the words "Basic human rights," "Innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment which pays attention very sensitively to his image.
"If this pursues the more, particularly as to you the Iranians ask not to act."
Since "silence solves nothing," past the discussion attempts about on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive actions."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "familiar, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages for the purpose of political extortion."
He announces who flees release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (who should come about 16th of August on the day, in which them in the French message) "the payment of a big sum of money asks to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of security).
And he allows to announce, the Elysée anticipates other taking of hostages, a phenomenon which will intensify "."
The Iranians could arrest "in close future another of about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been dismissed twelve days ago from the prison, nevertheless, it is held on furthermore in Iran.
Information was brought in circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the combined states demand on account of unlawful trade with sensitive electronics material to Iran has been dismissed after decision of a judge in Paris from the custody.
The American message positions itself, like numerous other observers, questions about this disconcerting coincidence.
For Washington which pursues the unlawful Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme the release of Majid Khakavand shows a bad news.
Has France accepted cow's trade?
The freeing of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4th of September François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, so he says, was completely surprised not only "from the decision of the judge," but has also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been an active exchange between the French presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out to the fact that Majid Kakavand stands furthermore under "strict" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, hangs up again, informs then the American diplomat, at the moment the Iranian "would be in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris."
During the safekeeping of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée does not spare his efforts, by means of announcements and from the media of organised "escape attempts" believe to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "high-powered mediator's role."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation yields fruit, because several press articles reflect the official French version.
One telegramme dating from the 25th of August, 2009 brings on "the media flash of the French authorities."
On which is based compared with so much "Dankesbezeugung" Mr. Assad, asks itself the Paris message.
"In spite of her explanations full praising the French authorities admit in petto that they have only one vague notion of what the Syrians have really done."
The document deals then with the reasons which have made the Elysée go to ruin this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "is designed to confirm Sarkozys politics of the opening towards Syria," he analyses.
A politics launched in 2008 which was perceived at that time "by numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad as premature and undeserved."
"The Syrian role blowing out" tries to make clear Paris "Syria which Belobigung one can achieve, while one plays a constructive role in the region."
Moreover, aim is to be sowed it, "discord between Syria and Iran."
The American message knows this from good spring.
11th of August François Richier had entrusted her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever have made."
"But we have thanked in spite of all them."
"This should donate at least confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns on the 16th of May, 2010 to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them in the Elysée.
In a communiqué he owes the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for her "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
No on-line plays for young Koreans after midnight
The South-Korean government will dismiss a law, called "das Aschenbrödel," which will forbid to the youngsters to play Online-Games after midnight, while it closes the access to them, indicated government person responsible.
A law draught which should ask the on-line play operators to keep the access to these plays youngsters less than 16 years after midnight is presented to the parliament in December, described representatives of Ministry of Education and the Arts and family ministries.
"Many children play these Games the whole night and have then difficulties with learning at school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary to guarantee her health and her right on sleep," explained Jo Rin, with this law draught of entrusted ministerial representatives of the French press agency Agence France press.
The Online-Games are accessible afterwards once more from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturer's societies would have during 1 year time to prepare for the use of the law, he specified.
The person responsible added the government fasser also in the eye to ask the manufacturers, which to screw off lasted time limit those youngsters daily for the access to these plays whose parents for it ask.
He will make available also to those people who wish it free programmes which enable to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one in the "mostly "linked up" country, and the newspapers report regularly about different, with intensive Internet use to linked events.
Moreover, the country is an undisputed champion in worldwide On-line Game competitions.
In November South Korea had gained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared with 58 other nations.
World championship in 2018-2022: the organizer's country appoints the FIFA
In bright excitement on the basis of corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA on Thursday appoints the organizer's countries of the world championships in 2018 and 2022, an extremely political choice by which tussling about influence as well as the lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
Nevertheless, a thing is sure: the issue in 2018 of the king's discipline of the FIFA will take place in Europe, her traditional stronghold, (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium).
Then the issue in 2022 will be a little more exotic; the international football association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to follow up his establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities, to the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political application of a world championship.
The machination behind the scenery threatens to stop up to the last minute.
To put up difficultly otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates.
After the Evaluationsbericht of the FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer to bessseren arguments as those of her competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees at the moment of the choice.
The Sunday Times which stood with the causation of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the exposures could have ruined as well the chances for her own country, cradle of the football, which might deliver only just once the world championship, namely in 1966.
The BBC had given on Monday once more fertile soil, while it had emitted a documentary report which takes three high-powered members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English people responsible in embarrassment who had pursued an intensive lobbying, primarily, with David Cameron during these last weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the manoeuvre successful by his predecessor Tony Blair which had achieved the organisation of the Olympic games 2012 in 2005 for London.
Would this intensive application be enough to revalue the image of England before the Kommitee again?
Nothing is sure less, because the duet Spain Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadia, his expert's assessment (world championship 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of both countries could damp her ambitions.
The possible repressive measures against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about Solvenz of Spain and Portugal raise the chances of Russia which has become in spite of his gaps in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport) the weighty outsider.
Nevertheless, prime minister Vladimir Putin has decided, denounced the open indication of the imputation of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.
"One pelts them with mud, one tries to compromise them," railed Putin.
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites seem to be.
The first economic world power, seat of the main sponsors FIFA, the country seems to show a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea which have put up separately a very nice project.
However, these new candidatures seem too early for two countries which had coorganized the competitions in 2002.
Another menace: the approval hotly desired by the FIFA of the world championship in 2026 for China which make the Asian chances of 2022 frail.
With Australia and Qatar which had put out all the stops with the respects futuristic stadia her expansion pursues the FIFA in the direction of new areas, however, these both countries show a bigger risk, because certainty.
Australia would be able just as Japan and South Korea under the weakness akquittierten from the European countries of the television rights (on account of the time movement) have to suffer, to the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
The second mandate: the Offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had really stopped short.
Centre edge left that he stops short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls over the next.
The topical head of state will be therefore a candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit stands to the side of the mystery which sticks to the presidency function, not well to face.
So one must act in such a way, as if the doubt existed from now on.
In one, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006 the followers of Jacques Chirac gave, the third mandate would not be excluded without believing even in it.
On the 15th of November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "sometime in autumn of 2011."
The fact that he would allow to be reminiscent on the Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians the perspective of "two mandates," therefore, had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit.
Was this the official announcement of his candidature?
Far from it.
The president let merely at the fact remind that the constitutional amendment of 2008 limits the number of the five-year-old terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidency choice on the occasion of such meetings in an amusing tone.
"You have if 7,5 more years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July, 2009.
On a new in May, 2010: "Does not think that I do not think about the phase afterwards."
His words from the day before yesterday do not make him any more the candidate than the day before; but also no less.
Should they cause comments, then for double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the HP on a side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène royal which Nicolas Sarkozy does to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his evident candidature in 2012 which many members of the HP admonish more early than accepted to the fight announcement.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time the voters of the rights would become a candidature of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to survey of the BVA-L'Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about that with the UMP," reacted immediately and carefully the sphere of the prime minister.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," informs Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe to be able to win," Alain Juppé who has resigned himself to the Offenkundigkeit corrects.
Euro: the EZB is made maintain her buyings of government stocks
The last meeting of the central bank advice of the EZB last year should offer opportunity to indicate possibilities as one comes out of the crisis, or announce at least the arrangement of a big number in unconventional measures of the monetary policy which should come at the end of the year for her end.
The crisis of the European state indebtedness obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford undoubtedly to forfeit also the today's, more than tense situation at the European loan markets not to cause their increase.
Besides, the political costs would be too high by far.
Yesterday the French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde had welcomed the active role taken by the EZB in favour of the solution of the budget indebtedness of Europe on the occasion of a press conference.
She does not have to say risqué whether she is to the opinion the central bank can act even more, for example, by boost of her programme of the buyings of state loans.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners ."
The day before Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had appeared in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economic committee and monetary committee of the European parliament not very voluble with regard to his plans, but had been content rather to point out to the fact that the programme of the purchases of government stocks at the secondary market "weiterbetrieben" would become and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how the decisions fall out."
The only certainty: The EZB will leave her leading interest consistently with 1%, the historically lowest level since May, 2009.
In practice the bond purchases of the treasury were doubled by the EZB the last week on about 1.35 milliard euros.
And yesterday according to indiscretions of some traders she should have effected new purchases in Irish and Portuguese government stocks.
All together the central banks of the eurosystem since May have carried out 2010 purchases at the rate of 67 milliard euros.
Among the traders the Antizipation of a Weiterverfolgens of the purchase course is on no account doubted (see page 29).
The economists already expect no more noteworthy course change.
If the loan shops of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the EZB, will potter about latter still in the unlimited finances reserves in freigiebige kind, namely for a period of one week up to three months.
The economists make themselves calm already today on it that this measure will still extend in some months.
"I cannot imagine that the EZB her programme in essential kind will change."
"Otherwise she would take the risk to provoke new tensions in the short period," Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank supposes.
"One for the course of the first quarter in 2011 intended, progressive climbing out seems to me more likely," Norbert Bräms, economist anticipates on his part with Sal.
Home Oppen.
In the area of her interventions at the market of the state indebtedness "such a purchase volume had to do the EZB in bonds aufrechthalten which animates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In consideration of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks at the markets of the state indebtedness in the eurozone the central bank has no other choice to maintain as her presence at the market.
"She must step for every price to the Steller of the lacking investors at the market and act so to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the yields paid in the weakest states," yesterday testified an important bond owner.
Since if the interest rates begin to the high-altitude flight, the states would be stopped even more from reducing her indebtedness or from stabilising even.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The government Berlusconi goes in Italy to cover
Yesterday after a weekly beginning disturbing for Italy the situation has relaxed with the decline of the basic interest rates for 10 years a little.
A return to the delusive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs the region chairpersons Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "indecipherable" qualify and heard to calculate him on an "unpredictable" week-end what the person concerned denied, nevertheless, immediately.
On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached his record from 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for the cover of the bankruptcy risk have risen on 263 points what had caused a certain rash in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his council of ministers to the fact that the discrepancy of Spain lies to the German interest rates with 400 base points.
Nevertheless, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "difficult anxiously" from the "market turbulence" and a possible infection danger from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson institutes.
In plain English this is called, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the schwindsüchtigen tax entrances walking along with it which endanger the state not to be able to cover his financing need any more.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In future an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and from 1.4% in 2012... although at the senate to the check present budgetary budget on 1.3% or 2% counts.
Under these conditions, so the EU commission calculates, the budget deficit next year will still put out 4.3% of the BIP (against 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence, also the turmoil around a new budgetary group which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 milliard euros.
"If necessary, new economy measures must be seized," believes chartered accountant Olli Rehn.
At the moment Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The basic parties of economy of Italy are in order and his accounts are regulated, we repeat this already since long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the international monetary fund who is entrusted with the IWF with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither on short-term, nor on long-term view, there from Italy in spite of his high indebtedness (119.2% of the BIP in 2011, A. d. R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte are demanded than of other countries," observes pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
If the question remains after the political unsteadiness.
On the 14th of December Silvio Berlusconi will be up against a motion of no confidence of the representative's chamber as a result of which early elections could be already organised at the end of March.
A little favorable period approaches for an adoption of resolutions concerning a heavy crisis.
Europeans think about the removal of the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had expressly emphasised it only yesterday within the scope of a press conference in Paris: "I believe, one has proved it still on Sunday afternoon as well as also in the evening: The Europeans hold together unambiguously, are ready and engaged to defend her currency as well as her currency area."
Although completely relatively - the deduction registered yesterday with the interest rates of the European state bonds was water on the mills of the governments as well as the EZB.
Nevertheless, from a normalisation beginning the speech cannot be yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced, she can lower the debt note of Portugal, the probably most effective target of the speculators nowadays.
"As in May exists an honest lack of clarity and political perceptibility which presses particularly on the bank systems," according to the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, particularly as "the political time passes much more slowly than of the markets."
The European countries, which this gap as well as the danger which is hidden in it are probably aware, intensify the discussions to the strengthening of the already available anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the straightest affected Ministers of Finance and in the broader sense with her opponents of the G20 well lead the way.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin in the beginning of the next week.
Today the EZB meets.
The lot of the unconventional measures stands on the plan to the backing of the countries of the eurozone in the crosshair of the markets (see below).
What concerns the EU-stability funds, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments concerning the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit Fundraising though, he prepares for this in addition absolutely the terrain.
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU-stability fund are planned for the next month.
Yesterday an official American representative of the agency Reuters had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase by the additional, direct engagement of the IWF mobilised funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are about for their part to take over structural reforms, in particular in the area of the job market organisation.
The reforms which come to the economy measures, however, effects in closer future should show.
Lisbon and Madrid on another way walk than this Greece and Ireland have acted.
One, as well as to the other lies for every price with it to avoid, to have to request international assistance, before they have put up her own budget correctives and have decided on unavoidable structural reforms which to them on a continuing basis the trust brings back.
The European sponsors talk again about the available options to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of state loans.
Axel Weber who was on the 24th of November on the travelling in Paris had produced the idea as the first that if 750 would be through Europe and the international monetary fund to mobilised milliards euros not enough, the union would not hesitate to reach once more in own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, concerning the market of the European state indebtedness quite being in the foreground actor, judge, a lengthening from about the 100 milliard euros would be sufficient, "mainly in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
These means exist: the European mechanism of endowed finance stabilisation which amounts at the moment to 60 milliard euros.
An advisory board who has all chances to be examined carefully in the European capitals.
Above all if the market terms taper to a point.

At least in the discussions.
One calls to himself, on this occasion, in particular the 23 milliards for the metro Grand Paris in recollection which should be built by the Société you Grand Paris.
To lead the start of construction work of the SGP in the ways, the state has exclaimed a capital donation of 4 milliard euros.
In the theoretical pattern this is the sum which the SGP would allow then to lend a part of the finance sum to her double at the markets.
Today, finally, it has come to the first projections.
The supplementary budget of 2010, this morning looked through from the finance commission of the National Assembly, contains the intended measures to raise the first part of this money.
It concerns, on this occasion, two things measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
Erstere, so one takes article 15 of the law draught, goes "in favour of the public law institution of Société you Grand Paris."
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Zweitere is a reorganisation of the already existing enterprise taxation: "to modernise this to increase which from her proving product and this rise of the Société you Grand Paris to überantworten."
How much would this introduce?
A riddle.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
From the 4 milliards one is far away.
"It is explained that the tax resources are included to the 4 milliard euros of the capital donation which are raised by the state and are performed the Société you Grand Paris bit by bit for the project," is to be taken from the explicatory statement.
One finds this system not at all indecent with the SGP.
"Since the moment at which one registers income (both taxes, d. R.), one can cover the project engineering more than three years and then scoop only from the 4 milliards," is explained.
"This is taken down in the budget and is drawn off bit by bit."
The SGP estimates that will be begun in 2013 to take down the 4 milliards for the budget in 2014.
This measure which for 4 promised milliards one will still be able to look long runs the risk to cause a surely moved, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting takes place on the 7th of December.
Revengeful hackers and industrious spies
A double meaning has the Affaire WikiLeaks.
On a side she has turned out evident scandal, a scandal which is only one scandal in the Sinner false holiness which governs the Beziehunge between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other side she announces radical changes at international level, and gives a foretaste on the future dominated by regression.
However, we go forward after the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act provided by a Secret Service (x any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary," American exposures about the sexual habits of Berlusconi throw down nothing else as what one got to read about months away anyhow in every x any journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the alarmingly karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered material for her sketches to cabaret artists already since long time.
The rule according to which the confidential dossiers may exist only of already known news is essential for the dynamism of the Secret Services, and not only this century.
If you go to a library which devotes itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognise that every work (about the Sangraal, the mystery of running Running Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats precisely this what was already written in previous works.
This comes along not only that, hence, still the author of occult texts wants to publish no searches (that he not knew where news about the non-existed would be to be found), but because those which devote themselves to the occultism believe in nothing differently than this what they already know and confirms what they have already learnt.
This is also the successful mechanism of Dan Brown.
Also of the confidential acts.
The informant is decayed, and decayed (or limited mind) is also the boss of the Secret Service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, the editor with Libération) who judges only as true what he recognises.
The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi which the American message in Rome had sent to the state department were the same like those, the Newsweek already the week before had published.
Why was made of such a fuss around the exposures of these dossiers?
On a side these mean what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - can call the heads of government to themselves at least since end of the second world war and since also mutually or can take an airplane to meet to the dinner - have lost her diplomatic function and have changed, with the exception of some small representation duties, into spy centres.
Every any spectator of inquiry films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from false holiness that one does in such a way to ignore this.
Still: the fact to repeat publicly it, the job of the false holiness injures and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: The idea that x more arbitrarily hacker can tap the most confidential secrets of the mightiest country of the world rescues the considerable blow against the prestige of the state department.
Besides, the scandal makes less the sacrifices, than rather the "sharp judges" in distress.
However, we devote ourselves to the profound nature of that what has happened.
Formerly, at Orwell's times, one could bundle up all power like a Big Brother which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out since then as completely right where one can control every movement thanks to the phone, every effected transaction, the visited hotel, the elective highway et cetera; the citizen would become the complete victim of the eye of the power.
If, however, one makes clear himself what runs off today that even the confidential crypts of the power any more cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the controlling way stops being directed unilaterally and becomes circle-shaped.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selectedly as an avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of the power in experience.
How can a power keep, however which is not able any more to protect her own secrets?
It is right, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can be never revealed); it is also true that every knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkels is basically a secret freely from Geheimis, because it reveals the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, indicates to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, against it, however, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult which was added to such an immense power?
It is evident that the states will put in future no reserved information to more on-line - this would amount to a notice stuck on on the street corner.
But it is as evident that it is in vain with the topical technologies to hope, to be able to keep secret confidential reports on phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state has moved in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could certain relations be maintained in future private and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment after science fiction and novelistic, but I feel forced to fancy myself the government agents, to itself in confidential way busily on uncontrollable march routes motively, her communications nowhere differently than in the bare memory with weight-bearing, and, in addition, few written information which they have got, in the shoe heel hiding.
The information would be stored in the only copy in close drawers: basically the spy attempt of Watergate had to register less success, than WikiLeaks.
I had to write the opportunity that the technology progresses nowadays like a cancer, namely backward.
One century after the wireless telegraph the communication had revolutionised, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video tapes had enabled to the film researchers to explore a film Tape for tape, while one could reel from the back forwards and ventilate all secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs allow nowadays nothing else, than to jump from chapter to chapter, so in macroservings.
By the high-speed trains one goes within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by airplane including the Umsteigens 3,5 hours.
Hence, it is not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
The last observation.
In former times the press tried to understand what were forged for secrets between the messages.
Presently these are the messages who demand confidential information of the press.
Climate: how France his finance promises schönredet
A year after the Copenhagen contract it is to be examined time, the observance of the fast relaxed financing promises (also "Almost start" or premature financing called) which was realised by the developing countries.
And the coarse French Schönredereien are already uncovered.
With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries have undertaken to provide 30 milliard dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 milliard euros more than three years away, France 1.26 milliard euros (i.e. 420 millions per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has put out all the stops to persuade her partners of the fact of her engagement with regard to the almost start financing: action report faithful to detail of her member states, press conference, big Nebenevents, pamphlet distribution.
The operation transparency is noteworthy and estimated just for her real value: the developing countries and the civil society would see it with pleasure if all developed countries made the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces to have released in 2010 2.2 milliard euros what it brings on the right way to the Respektbezollung of her engagement of 7.2 milliards in 2012.
If one looks, however, in the detail, the things lie a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen contract "anew and, in addition," to guarantee that an additional application was introduced, without to the disadvantage of the public development aid to gereichen.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what means "anew and, in addition,."
While the EU commission had suggested a harmonisation, certain member's states, under it France, the procedure have blocked.
Today everybody chooses the appoximate value which he judges as best.
The EU commission has itself, for example, as an appoximate value for that of 2009 chosen: the international financing will maintain, and adds within the scope of the financing "almost-start" more than three years 150 millions.
Other countries have chosen similar appoximate values, either concerning year or with regard to conditions at level of the public development aid.
As a countermove in addition was France of the opinion, the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 is new "and additional."
Differently expressed: There are no appoximate values on the issues of the preceding year or at global level of the public development aid.
Specifically said the total sum of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France pretends to keep to his obligation concerning "new and additional" financing.
Another, determining element is the classification in donations and advances.
No rule still rules over it, and everybody chooses his arithmetic mode.
Some, as for example France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously this is only hardly defensible: the trouble is not comparable.
If the use of advance can be justified for certain profitable investments (often to the issue containment engaged projects which are based on the most actual technology), it is delusive to present the euro which one takes in as a recompense for a donated euro... Besides, only the costs of the advance should be credited against the sponsor country as an engagement (i.e. the recompense of an interest rate).
But France has nothing differently for the purposes of than the following consideration: it "respects" his obligation of 420 million euros, while it takes up 91.5% of advance (389.8 million euros) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see the also EU document to convince itself of it.
France is only land of the EU that advance starts in big measure.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark which follow the Netherlands or Slovakia (among the rest,) to her obligations to 100% with donations.
In other words if the prevailing majority of the European Union spends 1€ to the fulfilment of her obligations, France gives just once 10 cents and understands by it a comparable application.
Nice abracadabra!
All in all, France operates in his almost start financing with a double dizziness: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action for the time away and to the other part with the reality of the financial application.
France succeeds in letting think that it has spent 420 millions "more anew and, more in addition," millions according to his promises and, besides, saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (there fine seems that it was Bercy which has carried out the arbitrage) a twice negative effect could cause; once EU-internal (why do the other member's states continue with the donation, if to lend it, nevertheless, enough?) and then during the negotiations, because the developing countries do not allow to be completely deceptive...
The chapter of the premature financing only one small question for relatively short time in comparison to the totality in discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
If we hope that this will not be the case.
How to him also is always, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
Primarily, France could announce a change in his posting kind for the years 2011 and 2012, namely in spirit of the respect for his obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring the discussions about the quarrel object of the long-term financing forwards (another, determining and at the moment discussed subject): one does not escape from the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the posting kind of his advances.
France could change his position to be as advancedly concerning the issues as it is with other things.
Hope is based on the new secretary of the environment Kosciusko-Morizet who will arrive the next week at Cancun.
An astonishing announcement about the almost-start of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of advance would raise from nature the international trust base which is inevitably for continuing discussions.
Alarm - from children taken pesticides
A child of 10 years takes about the day 81 different chemical substances, thus one this Wednesday of the union Générations futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of the coming generations) published study.
The union which explains that her results "in view of the low number return no statistically significant value in analysed tests but illustration character of the treated problems explain," had between July and September usually within four, from an approximately ten-year-old child for the meals to consumed food plus an intermeal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined just as Naschereien by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, treacly metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is shattering: 81 chemical substances, classed under it 42 as possibly or probably cancer-causing classified and five as sure karziogen, just as 37 substances with Endokrinin-sturgeon factor, according to studies of several institutions as for example to the international cancer research centre.
"Even if in the approximate totality of the cases the legal limits are not crossed for every chemical, individually taken substance, one infers from this elevation, nevertheless, very well that the reality in which the consumer is possibly put out to cancer-causing materials or substances with Endokrinin-sturgeon factor is alarming," notes the union.
Already with the breakfast only the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly cancer-causing remains and three certainly as carcinogenic proved, just as more than twenty remains which can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermeal for the study, shows tracks of six chemical substances, under it a fungicide forbidden in France.
The same one is valid for the French beans from Kenya, enclosed in the lunch with which the study has ascertained tracks of an insecticide strictly forbidden in the EU.
Further the minced meat steak, the tuna from the tin, even the French stick and the chewing gum were also larded by pesticides and other chemical materials.
With the tap water the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
With the dinner the salmon steak with 34 ascertained, chemical remains was the "most extensive," and even for warming up of the meal in the microwave used plastic plates was not unloaded.
The final-limited risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably undervalued," according to the study.
"Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has suggested for their part "in view of the urgency of the situation" introducing a moratorium about the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilisation illnesses."
In July a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had relation to the presence of remains 365 more different, in fruit and vegetables to the identified pesticides identified which are consumed in Europe under it 76 in Getreiden.
