The parliament did not support an amendment to release to Tymoshenko
The Parliament of the Ukraine has rejected today the proposal to revoke the amendment of the section of the Penal Code in which it condemns the leader of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko.
The modification would open to the doors to the release of a prisoner of exprimer minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the pains by economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the presumed signature in an agreement with disadvantageous Russia for the Ukraine on natural gas purchase.
The sentence not yet is firm, the appeal court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and in the West doubts have even arisen on the impartiality of the court.
The proposal of which paragraph 365 of the Penal Code retired with which it condemned ex- prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the voting.
For their approval 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The history of the Libya liberation, or the Libya rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him no longer there is war.
It is to define who is the winner
As it is or custom in the region, the islamists gained the elections, but now it is to explain if it is moderate or radical
The National Council of Transition has made enter the traditional law, the sharia in force, that already in certain way we know.
Libya will become a country without delinquency, because to the thieves the hand will be cut to them.
The women already can be forgetting to emancipate and the apostates and so on hoping their execution.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, the society, composed of tribes single-breasted uniform jackets, it will be united by Quran.
In Libya an order will settle down that we cannot nor be imagined and that certainly we cannot.
Nevertheless, our form of life is neither unique nor objectively the best one and, probably, it did not agree to them, however, to the Libyans or mentioned.
The certain thing is that it does not stop surprising that the Islamic combatants accepted been thankful for the aid of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the attacks of NATO a American general did not direct them, but great is Wing, whose greatness celebrated after each one of the successful interventions.
When winners in Libya look for, the West is not among them.
We are catched in a shooting del that uses to the islamists and our politicians to undo of a dictator in the person of a political ally without there are guarantees to obtain benefits.
After recent the bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, to the premises it does not suppose a problem to them to expel to the “crusaders”
But, without occupation they will be able oil ones to only take control of Libyan black gold with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it can be that finally the West can be conceited to protect the human rights.
Whenever the followers of the sharia do not cross to us.

Daily menu of an obese boy: it does not have breakfast and it has dinner inlays
More of a third of the children with ages between the 9 and 13 years they have overweight problems, where the overweight affects to 9% of the scholastic population and the obesity to 5%.
The obese children come in their majority of families with a lifestyle that is not healthful, according to comes off themselves present investigations.
One becomes to demonstrate which is the importance of the atmosphere where it becomes conceited for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
In the table, the obsessed children feed themselves, for example, of inlays at least with the frequency double that the children of families with normal weight.
In order to have dinner, more of 19% of the obese ones they had had dinner chips the day before the analysis, which is tie to the prevention program “the obesity is not a chance”.
In the families of children with overweight custom does not exist to practice sports, which is applicable to the majority of the present families, where 15% of the children only responded that its parents, at least once per week, find time for the physical exercise.
Realised survey to 900 children
The survey was realized the past at the end of academic term and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education of all Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program of “the obesity of is not a chance”, that supports and Insurance agency General the Sanitary Unilever company.
Until now, they have participated in the project more than 12 thousand children from 4º to 8º course.
A suitable diet and exercise in family is determining factors enough, that make even diminish remarkably the number of children with overweight and obesity.
“Half of the survey children has only responded who have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, have tea and have dinner, that is one of the basic conditions for a healthful diet”, gather one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast but with inlay to have dinner
The specialists warn that, in a healthy development, they are important, in addition, the details, that also count, as for example to have one stated time for the breakfast in family.
In Czech Republic, however, 23% of the families of students only have breakfast to the same hour.
In the majority of the families, each only has breakfast.
But the worse thing was to discover than in 10% of the homes nothing is had breakfast.
The breakfast is, nevertheless, the base of a correct daily diet.
The study sample that in the families of obese children is consumed with much more frequency the insane chips.
All - independent of the weight - almost drink on a daily basis sweet refreshments (70%).
By general norm they make sport more of 40% of the survey children, nevertheless, you enter his parents this result is reduced less than to half, only 15%.
Make your diet to you
The following phase of the study made possible that the chosen lads (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) would be created their own diets from all the possible supplies according to their tastes and opinions.
“The nourishing preferences of the Czech children in ages between the 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy feeding, are very remote of the ideal.”
Between its favorite foods they are grazes, the meat and the candies
“The popularity of the sweet refreshments Is mainly alarming”, is let know in the final report of the study.
As main food takes the palm grazes and it close by follows to him the bird meat.
Practically, the children always reject the vegetable and the taste by the fish and the vegetable is very low.
Change to healthful habits
At the same time, the study sample that the children are prepared to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled up the questionnaire after finishing to the prevention program “the obesity is not a chance”, a significant change in favor of the principles of an feeding occurred in many cases heals”, scores in the results of the study.
Llama the attention, for example, regarding the sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer the normal and current water.
The children also would choose with more frequency in the questionnaire the meat of bird and the fish for the main food and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the flour derivatives.
The stylist also has to be a good psychologist, maintain the professionals
In the introductory article, How they learn the stylists, or I complained a little that the initial lessons or enough were loaded.
It did not have nor idea of how that one would go.
Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminary it exceeds how it works in the world of the spectacle.
And he will be worse.
The more close they are the final examinations, the more information and practical tasks wait to us
And although the course is developed every Saturday and Sunday, no longer fits a pin.
We are time we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how dressing the woman that does not have a perfect symmetry.
And thus it is the great majority.
Somebody is cuellicorto, somebody has a streamlined figure without the suitable curves and somebody undergoes overweight.
The stylist has to know how to smooth some wide shoulders optically, to extend a neck or to recreate the necessary curves
They have given certain tricks us exceeds how to make emphasize the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, enormous chests and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it a too challenging way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or the pants does not adapt, it is worth the pain to be made sew at least an extra fabric piece to size.
Without a doubt they will not regret, because the clothes that feel perfectly are priceless.
With a skirt to size one will feel far better that with which does not stop to move, to rise, it dances in the waist, etc.
The streamlined body can be allowed to dress clothes in you fold, draped adornments, embroiderings or.
There are certainly many types of diverse information and bodies, so I am contented of which I have all the week to put order in my head all this information.
And even thus, I am afraid that with the assigned task, already I have more very well.
To each participant in the course famous ones have been assigned to him two, to which it will have to design two clothes: one for the day and another one for the night.
It is necessary to consider the present aspect, the fashionable style that adapts the person at issue.
Perhaps it has been called on to me “to dress” to Miranda Kerr, you know it the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Shout on the inside, for me is far better that, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have fattened about one hundred kilos (please, they consider exaggeration), or jovencísima Selena Gomez.
The dresses we must trim them of the magazines or look for them in Internet and print them, later to elaborate them graphically.
Moodboard, that is as it is called to the complete result, it express in addition our personal style and our relation with the graphical design.
It is important also to think about the graphics section of the estilismo.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also it takes care, for example, of the product pages in the magazines (of concrete subjects, like tendencies, purses, coats, etc.).
Of all this spoke to the stylist and designer to us Mario Kameník.
But all this already is for Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three specialistic guests mainly animated to the conference of Saturday with information type of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashionable designer Jakub Polanka and the fashionable photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub remembered us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist would have to know to remove party to him to this.
And a good stylist knows to work with a same article to dress diverse forms.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the such raincoat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to classic in jeans and the t-shirt, but also it serves to dress the naked body in heel shoes and to photograph it as if it was in fact a dress.
Or it is enough to roll up it and to raise the neck to obtain a totally different image.
“You play in this way”, insisted to us.
What I value more is the following advice: “To begin to work, it is necessary that first you know all the rules”.
“Soon already you can break them”, said Jakub.
To finally it is clear me why to memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if soon it is that in the magazines fashionable we were different results.
That without speaking of the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Horseradish tree, I know that a stylist must have more types of clothes in the reserve of which it tries to photograph.
Thus, for a fashionable history that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), it is necessary to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition that the photos the clothes work in combination with other articles, all of them different ones from which is used in the reality.
All this is necessary to have it in account at the time of designing outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured to us that the image and the style suppose single they, in many cases, half of the success.
It is enough to look at Madonna, who is not indeed an extraordinary singer, but the image and márquetin have made of her a world-wide star.
In Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no a tendency clear to use the services of the stylists.
Until the famous characters they also find it useless (my abilities are enough to me, my physical aspect does not have as much importance).
And when somebody requests our services to us, it is necessary to consider that is very probable that they indicate a size to us very different from hers real one (smaller).
Soon only it is to guglear and to find out if the tabloids already have written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gotten fat/become thin, etc.
Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted to us on which to the stylist it is not enough to him to orient itself in the fashion, but must understand of outfit.
During his work, mainly one is due to communicate with the people to whom it dresses, reason why is fundamental to be a good psychologist.
It knows to evaluate people, one does not become of less, it defends his opinions.
“When a director you contract so that you classify clothes to him and you complete it with beautiful articles, you cannot take and throw everything what there was and say: “huy what horror "".
“You find at least a pair of things that you can weigh and recommend so that somebody can be put”, Mario says.
He himself also showed to us that everything must fit in the call “placovka”, that is to say, work stock-market.
This pays attention around the waist and all the necessary tools are had there.
They are objects like scissors, like scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There is also thread of nailon (that serves to the stylist during the session as photos as products such to him that purses or caps), special tweezers of article enlistment ahead, if this outside greater one (pins and another type of enlistments not are allowed, because they could damage the weave), or a seam game.
Not to be left us in passive listening and to put something in practice, we have learned to have the sole with the shoes.
Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in a flat surface, the sole could be damaged much more and still the outside.
And we did not do more than to have and to have.
We could not be called on the shoes with the scissors not to damage them by accident.
So there was to be very capable.
Mario has employed to a joy when praising my to me without reserves.
The truth is that those abilities do not occur me very well.
This is only a small part of all those that we have listened to the weekend throughout, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that to dedicate me to the estilismo at professional level is not a rose way, but it gives me exactly the same what people say.
In for Need Speed: The Run competes by all America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated because of a series of improper negligences of a routine trip during the morning turn.
To a certain extent one was able to cover the expectations, but it does not serve don't mention it, if, in fact, it were not tried to do nothing extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which to the title The Run is added, already woke up great expectations before its opening.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old saga of races for Need Speed and, as a result of the shown thing, appears like a game that would not have to finish again being a sort of action immediately.
Also we felt peculiar by knowing how they would be the inserted scenes, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As usually it happens in the series of NFS, the results do not vary great thing with respect to which we were expected.
There are races that can be given by acceptable, but in the total calculation points because of absurd failures are lost, that already come appearing in the series for years.
In fact errors cannot nor be denominated, but it is rather the incomprehensible lack of appetite of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
One introduces you in a history, whose protagonist, Jack, have certain personal problems\; in order to solve them, it is offered to participate to him in an illegal race by all America.
You sit down to the steering wheel in the coast the west, in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive the first a New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided in ten stages and, then, more than fifty races.
Of it is deduced that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different surroundings, that are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, one remotely does not have nor the sensation of which the game always offers the same.
Some of the surroundings are even pleasant in view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the one of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, he is not nothing of the other world.
But the stroll by the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you are a sand storm that diminishes the visibility.
However, in mountains it is necessary to have well-taken care of so that it does not bury an avalanche to you.
According to that, each one of the races are very well developed.
Only there is a pair of models, but with that coarse one.
During a little while, you try to advance to an amount of rivals demanded (the normal thing in a classic race), later you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and soon it waits for a duel to you against a single adversary.
In the middle of all this it appears the police sometimes, that it does not make but make difficult the things still more.
The newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations always appear when Jack, in the majority of the cases, has to escape of somebody and you must help it, pressing the right button at the moment just.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, nevertheless, that are enough less landscapes in the game than it would be possible to hope (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get to be annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that cause that the game is more interesting.
The conduction model follows the tracks of the previous episodes.
That means that to day of today no longer it is great thing, but it is not possible to be affirmed that he is bad.
If you look for a realistic simulation, you already can look for elsewhere.
But to a race conceived with action this style of conduction agrees to him enough enough, although we will be able to find something better between the games of the competition.
Up to here, everything in sequence.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct thing of the conduction models, no longer it happens the same with the collisions.
Of games of this type it is not possible to hope that it recreates complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, consequently everything is not in sequence.
He is typical that, when doing an advancement very fit or to circulate the car with a normal traffic, only are slight rubbing, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even finishes totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reseteo system, great problems do not arise, but it can put to you of the bad humor.
The reseteos are programmed of such form that, when you suffer an accident or you leave you of the track, the game restitutes you to the last point of rescue in the track.
Nevertheless, in each race it is only had five reseteos available.
If you consume them all, you must reinitiate the race from the beginning.
Therefore it is not more than a aid in case something does not go well, but is not very of FIAR.
Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only helps learning itself the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter of a specific way\; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you somewhere are “civil” vehicles always with the same configuration, although you are first, fifth or you arrive five minutes sooner or later.
This makes rage mainly in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the encounter in opposed directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or restrain.
It is equal when you arrive, because it is programmed so that the “surprise” always will happen in front of your noses.
The adversaries have in addition an advantage.
During all the game you will arrive at sites where, without considering the moment, always it will advance the same adversary to you in the same site.
In addition this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is still more startling.
Your opponent must arrive before you, to the price that is.
When it goes in front of you, it makes difficult the vision to you of the cars that come front, so at the outset you can make pap the car.
The idea to create a game with principles dose of suspense and adrenalin, but the execution is so apparent that can be understood surely it disappoints to you immediately.
And it is a pain, because although the model of the trip it is simple, the game is funny and with action, so that often it is not possible to follow retail what happens nor where.
And it really gives equal, if the merit takes to the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that the boredom does not fit, or any other thing.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You must be kind to the gas pumps next to the highway, because exactly you must there change of car, although in the great majority of the cases it will be enough to you what you have.
The cars are divided in three categories.
The sport ones are adapted for urban zones, the American for straight freeways and exotic strong cars the supersport ones for a technical conduction, for example, by mountain highways with curves.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, that is to say, is races in concrete places that you will know by histories.
Here you will obtain not only medals, but also experience point for your profile, that serves so much for the challenges as stories.
When reaching the level superior, the conductor opens several possibilities to him, beginning by the car and ending bottoms for the profile.
At the same time, it has in line connected a Autolog function, that compares your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other communitarian functions.
One of the elements most difficult to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you arrive until the tunnel of the meter (it happens), where you put yourselves to run in the dark by the routes (it happens).
The speedometer marks to you between 150 and 200 km/h (it happens) and, suddenly, behind arrive the convoy to you from the meter and it takes to you ahead immediately.
In the writing surely we will have a discussion on this during several days, on if during the programming of the game no it thought a little at least or if the authors really take us by one bulging one from stupid.
The technical part of the game is not nothing extraordinary, but the general visual effects are at least in the majority of the pleasant cases, sometimes until magnificent.
Since pain that, at the tensest moments is reduced the quality of image and, sometimes, a serious way.
This affects mainly to the accidents where there is involved many participants, when the quality of continuous image no longer is valid.
The audio one is well and the sound track is a question of pleasures.
In order that it is to the liking to most of the youthful group, the sound track belongs to the category “each of its father and his mother”, but it is possible to be supposed that nobody would only buy the game by its music.
The final sensation of for Need Speed: The Run is then quite confused.
If the game avoided idiot absolute errors, we would have problems in affirming that The Run is the best game of NFS of the last years.
It gives the sensation of which the game is not concluded.
The diversion is assured, but prepare to you because the errors will strike in the eyes with the force of some airport reflectors.

The ambassador before the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativistas and euroskeptics.
“The treaty of Lisbon has affected significantly to the balance between the individual institutions”
“It did not hope to me that a war without quarter mounted”.
“He will last five, six years, before the situation becomes stabilized a little, it calms and the new players are accustomed to their new papers”, thus began with conviction their conference in the Faculty of Right the Czech ambassador before the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take itself in serious its motto “clearly and openly on Europe”, that said or in the first part of its conference, when it was able to describe to each organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Right of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also weighed the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“First the critics arise, that if he is dull, a civil servant gray, able to assume any roll, but I have to say that it left all disturbed, because it assumes his rolls perfectly”.
“He is a man who knows to listen the members of the twenty-seven states, to communicate with them and whom a very clear vision of towards where has the EU must go”.
The new position of representative of the Foreign policy and Security is explained from the question: “Who is this EU? To what number I can call it”. One is then an important step towards the unification and the clarification of the political union facing States like China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit the cheese us of Olomouc
Vicenová has also taken care of the agenda followed, follows and will follow the European Council in the future next.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emergent economic crisis, solved the crisis of the gas and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified like a very negative aspect, that affected seriously to Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments.
In words of the ambassador: “a good uproar”, not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, that is treating now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to adopt the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the present economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and effective, what sectors will have priority, what will countries receive major support and which less? That is something that will be present in the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also remembered her main mottos, with which she arrived at Europe: “About Europe with clarity”.
“The certain thing is that I do not like the ugly abbreviations, the extranjerismos or the slangs that people do not understand”.
“How a citizen can understand that in Brussels the cucumbers are not really invented the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of diverse sizes or that nobody is going to us to prohibit the cheese of Olomouc”.
Also it tries to remove more benefit from the atmosphere of the EU and to approach more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
It waits for the Europe to us of the speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have fame of euroskeptics and people rather perceive the negative aspects that the positives.
In addition, it lamented the participation loss of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is of multitude of factors, like the modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
Besides the success of the Czech presidency, it put of relief the force and the collaboration of the Group of Visegrad.
“Create to me that when goes a Pole and a Hungarian and a Slovak approaches to me, a French side says to me: “What, already you have been, the ones of the Group of Visegrad? “, and one sees that he does not do any grace to him”.
In the future, to the EU, according to Vicenová, they wait the new hardest norms to him of budgetary policy for the Member States.
It is perceived like something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if they are not more, in Europe, more than the new one of “the European Federation”.
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone”.
“We have the Schengen space and we have in addition the procedure to reinforced cooperation”.
“One said for the first time that only they cooperate the countries that want and those that no, that remains outside”.
“These procedures will be more and more and reinforce the Europe of the two speeds”, is expected Vicenová.
In this sense, also it emphasized the paper of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the subjects that affect to the totality of the EU are due to debate between the Member States, not only between the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The IBM innovator initiates her second century of existence
If somebody looked for a term that defined with high accuracy the strategy of IBM, the most approximated it would be “long term”.
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived like present and, nevertheless, already have passed one hundred years from its foundation.
The base of this largoplacista character put it the first head of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
It already coined the motto of which many problems of the world have solution if people are prepared to think.
Its motto “Think” one became his seal, around which it will be constructed the life of the future giant (it was also the title of an internal magazine which IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was in addition the base to a culture of carefully raised company.
“For us, IBM implies a long term thought, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and prospered during one hundred years for that reason, because faithful to his basic principles stayed, but without fearing around to the changes.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform the technology, the business and the society.
We hope to prosper still more in our second century”, it affirmed during his anniversary, the present director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in years 30, worried about the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Baťa in Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were of the first American workers who enjoyed paid vacations, surely, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that awarded to the best inventors and salesmen.
The same long term sophistication maintains it IBM in the relation with the client.
From the beginning the company already knew to discover talents (to being one of the first world-wide companies in ending any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the strategy anti-discrimination it is the present plan of IBM, by which to Palmisano a woman will replace it next year: Virginia Rometty.
It already takes working thirty years in IBM, where she has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.
During the past few years IBM has participated in the calls virtual encounter, rain of ideas in line, from which they arise infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not to surprise that ideas, because exceed in the signature million people work almost half.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides to the company an internal and external image hard.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution more than of technological company”, it affirms to the economist professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve problems of businesses for users of the technology”, it emphasizes George Colony of the Forrester Research consultant.
As the own company says exists a difference between entering the business and of creating a business directly.
IBM - or the “Great Green one” - as familiarly is known it in the EE.UU because of its logo, has in the last become one hundred years one of the majors companies of the world.
It is possibly the more versatile company technological (it develops as much equipment as programs, infrastructures and services lodging Web within an ample range of services, that goes from servants to nanotechnology).
It shows the greater number of patents of all the North American technological companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel prize.
Between its inventions they are the automatic teller, the cards of payment, the financial exchanges, the bar codes and the diskettes.
IBM will invoice this year 220 billions of dollars. This year has become the second technological signature by capitalization of market (first it is Apple), when it surpassed for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking at the future
All the products and innovations do not finish satisfying the taste with the clients and the moment (IBM did not bet by its own operating system, OS/2, services in line Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).
“If its business is based on advancing, it cannot anchor emotionally in the past”, recognized Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that reason, IBM does not have problems in constructing its bases in other platforms (and also, if they do not work, it leaves them).
And it difference of the competition, Microsoft, that basically stays and falls always exclusively with Windows.
Technology de futuro
In a matter of sales, IBM is dedicated mainly to services, of which approximately one fifth part is of programs and another villa of equipment.
However, still in 1990 the equipment represented more than half of the quota of the suppliers.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold active of low yield by a total value of 15 billions of dollars. During in the same period, it has invested 58 billions of dollars in the purchase of technology de futuro.
The investments have followed from 2008, when the modern world-wide financial crisis was pronounced for the first time.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first head, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29 increased the investments.
It seems that until now the IBM company has known to heave the crisis.
The value of the actions of IBM from the beginning of year 2008 has grown stratospherically to a 120%, the net benefit of the company has not stopped increasing.
The currency of IBM is to change it everything, except for its value.
It is possible, then, to be hoped that when comes the following crisis, this flexible giant will hold.
History of IBM: from the cutting one of cheeses to the space flights
The IBM company (International Business Machines) was based on New York one hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM name is adopted already in 1924 - originally it was a used brand in the branches of Canada and South America.
The base that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the fusion of four companies that go back to the decade of 1880.
It owned inventions like the famous “clock to clock on and off”, that allows to control the entrance and exit of the employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his advice supervisor.
Flint filed the head of a company of the competition, Thomas J. Watson, so that it helped it with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed to the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson continue being the firm base on which to the corporative culture and identity are sustained).
Watson managed the company until year 1952.
IBM, as it indicates its name, began with the production and sale of all type of equipment for businesses, from cutters of meat and cheese to recording boxes.
During the four first years that Watson managed the company, the invoicing was duplicated in 9 million dollars and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, after forty years almost occupying the chair of the head, was replaced by its son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began to work in the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In 60 years the personnel and the computers of IBM helped the NASA to guide the flights the space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.
Classic “pecés”, that restored the standard of computers of that one time, arrived at the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, on the other hand, acquired the part of consultancy of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advising and services of high added value.
The strategy that has paid to IBM these three last years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is to say, “a more intelligent planet”.
Its objective is to make a more rational use of the technology, although the areas have still not been planned nor has improved the circumstances, for example, with respect to the transport and the administration of cities.
For the sector of the commerce, IBM not long ago presented the platform “Smart Commerce” that it allows the retailers to manage the complete business cycle.
IBM has one long history in this country.
In 1932 it already opened a branch in at that time Czechoslovakia, the first country that had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today here, IBM ČR operates in addition the strategic center to externalisation in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe have is in the Prague. Also there is an equipment of investigation of world-wide fame here that works with the voice recognition.
Rychtářová about its unfaithful husband:
Iveta, is left you to that donkey, that no longer I want it!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said one finished!
After his husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also his lover, Darina continued having the hope of which Josef awoke of his pink dream and would return to house.
Nevertheless no longer it is going to hope and it has established clear rules for the life in the future.
“Pepe can return to house, but no longer like my pair”, explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed during the summer in Bartošové in its house, it could not nor imagine how its marriage would finish.
In spite of the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
Until it declared publicly that it loved it.
With time, Darina was resigned, apparently it accepted the relation of its husband and it even took leave of him for always.
To Rychytář it does not matter to him with whom his wife lies down.
If a Rychtář day broke with Bartošová, his wife would not at home wait for it with the open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if it wants to live the rest on his life in our house, nobody will throw it”.
“But it would live not only like my beloved and old ass here that was mistaken, but like a man to whom they unite certain bows to me”, it said Rychtářová and it added that already one had come unhooked of its husband and only insisted on the mutual respect.
To Josef until now it does not matter to him that woman has closed him the door of back.
“Acceptance the decision of my woman”.
“I will be with Iveta and there is no possible change”.
“My woman settled down this like a marriage on the paper and I respect it”.
“The company follows in force, makes the adjustments of house, care the garden, the home, makes the purchases”.
“Darina and I was spoken with normality, the only thing is that we did not share bed, said Rychtář.
If Rychtářová found a new love, it would not be against.
“We did not sleep together and she does not interest to me, nor where she goes nor if has some groom.
I already know that it is fault mine, I fell in love with Iveta and I assume all the responsibility”, concludes Josef.
The worse vices of the women: Also they talk about you?
If you ask the men who are able to mention some typical vices of the women, generally each of will name them them without thinking.
Dear women, you are clear in the following lines, where mention certain feminine vices that they are able to make boil the blood to the men?
To go of purchases
It reproaches to him to his average orange that has dependancy of the purchases?
It has to at least buy a trapito in week?
Does it like to often buy in the reductions?
Then if so it is possible to be said that to go of purchases one has become a vice.
Some women realize who would have to calm their passion by the purchases, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to take a walk immediately by the clothes stores, to look for articles good fit and later to try on them all in the probador (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for the majority of the women to go of purchases is a pastime, for the men can practically become a hell.
It only remembers how many times already it said to him to his pair that better waits for it in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
“I am not too fat”
“It would need to thin five kilos at least - it would have to begin to make exercise”
“I really pleasure to you”
They don't sound these phrases to him?
To that yes?
Then she is one of those women obsessed by its aspect.
He is not that you must stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listen their pair to complain their physical aspect all along.
Sex hard also agrees in which the more increases the frequency of the complaints, the more annoying they become the women.
The order and the cleaning in the first place
It is like an infinite carousel.
To clean the windows, to pass the vacuum cleaner, to mop the ground, to clear the dust, to at least mop the bathtub and all that twice per week.
It reproaches to him to his pair that the clean ground with a dirty foot has stepped on him, to its children who have soiled a washbasin just cleaned and a bookcase with glass doors that as much cost to clean to him?
In case you undergo this “deviation”, she tries to be conscious that nothing would be due to exaggerate and that the order and the cleaning surely would not have to occupy to be fundamental in the family.
This inoffensive desire of cleaning could threaten its relations and the familiar well-being.
To make disagreeable commentaries
“The used underpants are left with the dirty clothes.”
“You want to also put tomorrow those used socks to you”
“The wet rag is not left in the ground”
If it does those cometary to his pair more times to the day, it knows that thus it will be able to remove it from his squares.
Naturally. You do not mean nothing bad, only wants to obtain that everything is in sequence.
Perhaps, if the men knew this, the women, on the other hand, would not make so many commentaries.
Calumnies and gossip
To some women the calumnies, the gossip also go to them, but also the offenses and the conspiracy against somebody.
The women concentrate themselves in the relations, for that reason they like to speak together of things of the type who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps to each of us sometimes a small and inoffensive gossip escapes to him.
With the hand in the heart, this is own of almost all the women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of whom they are not controlled, to that it enchants to them to tattle and they often do it, they despise to all and they are dangerous for which they surround them, mainly in a feminine labor equipment.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their attendances to win to the Philadelphia
The forward of hockey Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the encounter of NHL with two attendances that brought the victory on the Philadelphia 5:3 in the field of Carolina and returns to put to the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux it took advantage of the play the star of 39 years, and took a step more and it was declared better player of the party.
One also was sold two attendances in the party and the companion of Jágr, Jakub Voráček.
After the encounter, Jágr affirmed before the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the party it had already said to him that it would make triplet”.
“It had a feeling It”.
“Sometimes they seem ambushes”, explained Jágr, after its action gave a goal him to Giroux, as a result of first trallazo of the Flyers.
Awhile later also the second intervention of the equipment had a Czech sign.
Voráček took control of the disc behind the goal of the Hurricanes and it moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot, that it put goal.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the start of the second part already they dominated the Flyers.
Concretely by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr it put the third goal, after its firing was strained by the quarter of the goal of Wayne Simmonds.
“It enchants to Me to play with him”.
“I do not mean that he is the best player of the field, but without a doubt is between the three best ones”, weighed Jágr to its power station.
“It would never have been happened to me that at the end of my race was going to play with a sportsman like him”.
“Very I am satisfied with it”.
“I want to play for him”.
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results”, adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and after new of Dwyer, of penalty, until putting itself to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, although they finished surpassed in number of two against one.
“Pronger had a good action in our field”.
“It cleared the disc, I took speed and Read went more towards the moved away part”.
“I tried to hit upon to him to the disc and am contented because I obtained it”, it described to Voráček the last goal of the party as it lived it.
With its victory, Philadelphia has been put in head of Conferencia This.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the third second retired by an injury in the part superior of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with much experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec did not know to take advantage of one the firings.
More than the lost points to injured the local trainer it lamented the great amount of in the last row, and to only play the party with five defenses.
“That is bad”.
“We only played the party with a veteran player, the rest were novates to them”.
“In short, but it is that against that nothing can be done, we must fight in this way”, said Jacques Martin.
“As much to rotate the players one became against us, we could not resist it”.
“We had to simplify the game still more, to remove the disc from our field”.
“And thus we left hollows”, explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
The goals of Jets were marked by five players who ended thus a series of defeats that already lasted five parties.
How the prices of the trips have evolved from 1989
Until 1989 there were in at that time Czechoslovakia only five state travel agencies authorized: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that one moment only sold in the majority of the cases trips to the socialist block, because the trips to the West were very restricted.
The Czech tourists went, therefore, of vacations to beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to be traveled to Yugoslavia, nevertheless, later the Yugoslav regime inclined towards the west and the trips of the Czech tourists then were restricted enough.
A great paradox of the socialism individually went the fact that to the citizens of the socialist block (that is, also to the Checoeslovacos) would not be allowed them to travel free and not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter invitation, if no, the individual trip were not possible.
The travel agencies also offered in those times trips to the West, but one was due to put to the tail with a sleeping bag and to happen all night thus, or to have “good well-known” in the agency.
Even so everything was not gained.
The call “change promise” that was the condition for the trips to the West, was not granted to the “people politically little trustworthy”, who thus could not travel absolutely.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a convertible currency freely and, without change guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The great majority of the Czechs spent their vacations in their own country, reason why there was a great number of cabins and houses of summer, that the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way to travel of the Czechs has suffered from 1989 an authentic revolution.
Whereas until 1989 for us he was does not go more to spend the vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria, the past year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips from vacations to countries worldwide.
Great paradox is nna, of which nowadays no longer we are conscious, the fact that to at the moment favorite destiny, the Croatia, until 1989 could not be traveled freely, because it comprised of at that time Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of years 90 the visa exemption prevailed to travel to the neighboring States of western Europe, which caused an enormous big wave of visits of short duration, coverall to Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, during long time, were not fed up with the excursions the West, everybody wanted to see it less for a moment.
For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs in the parks in tents slept, since our at that time income did not allow to pay to a hotel or pension us.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that one time was to take it with himself the food (conserves, inlays, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, thus our tourists could finally, after decades, to buy western currency freely.
Our standard of life also increased and him the average wages, which around 1997 brought about an increase in the demand of trips.
With the increase of the demand of trips the agencies began, as of 1997 with regularity, to prepare the trips using the connections of flights charter, which made to incredibly go down the prices of the trips in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90 of the last century, already the Czechs traveled without visa to almost all the developed countries, except EE.UU., which simplified our trips still more.
Another interesting moment in the history of the tourism pos-revolutionary happened already in the 2000, when it was organized, thanks to an enormous demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
From that one year, they every year divide to direct flights charter with Czech tourists made distant and warm countries. This winter already will fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinies.
The exotic countries at the moment visit them near 100 thousand Czechs the year.
Another interesting moment of this time, that symbolizes our development pos-revolutionary, arrived in 2008.
The 17 of November of 2008, EE.UU eliminated visas for the Czech tourists, and so our country happened to be more between the developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have happened more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been spent in trips the foreigner more than 15 thousand Czech crowns by head, including the expenses in the stay site.
Summoned General Assembly Ordinaria to choose the president, who could finish again o'clock dead.
For almost five months Czech soccer is without president and is probable that the successor of Ivan Hašek like President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR), will not know himself nor after the call of the next General Assembly Extraordinaria that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, not yet one has reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without the same, it will not be possible to be voted at least to choose between the three candidates.
The interested ones to preside over Czech soccer are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned to its position in June not without first to summon its colleagues in order to find a strong person that it knew to take care of soccer in the future.
Nevertheless, after concluding the era Hašek, a controversy between the two bunds of the association untied incapable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
It was in evidence the 16 of September when it had to be chosen the new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the praguense district of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not only as far as the election method.
It was not arrived at any consensus nor as far as whom in the General Assembly it had right to also vote - only the legal representatives or the delegates with plenary sessions powers.
As of that moment and due to this only point, a partial agreement, also endorsed by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Right took place, according to which the representation by plenary sessions powers is not possible.
Nevertheless, the disputes on the electoral code follow open.
More light on the situation no longer could throw nor the Executive Committee that, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a pair of times already, but the neuralgic point continues being the same.
The question is the following one: how to come in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
“The dispute turns around if another model is due to come in agreement with the statutes or to find”, it says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, that, from the direction of the association, it represents professional soccer.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round that one candidate will win who has major percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is arranged to arrive at a commitment so that one candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both bunds can win.
The Bohemian part, nevertheless, imposes the condition of which the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have the majority of at least two thirds.
“This would clear to him, nevertheless, the sense to the two previous rounds and would deny the concept of bicameral system completely”, thus it is as Svoboda understands the objections of the part morava, according to which the best thing would be not to touch the order and to vote according to the applicable statutes.
With what has been said, surprising, it agrees also Tomaš Paclík, although one assumes that the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all the candidates agrees more to Pelta.
“I would like that she vowed to the maximum in agreement with the statutes”.
“So that they do not invent any triviality about the representatives like in the last General Assembly”, the proprietor of Victoria Plzen says, that is postulated for the first time like candidate and who directs his observations against Pelta mainly.
Pelta continues being optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk he will be decided on the new president and he thinks that the candidates in the future cooperated constructively.
“All the passions will calm down with the party of today of our national team in the European Championship.
“Soccer will return to be protagonist, and thus more to taste would be cooperated” affirms the representative of the Jablonice, that of the three candidates has more experience in management of soccer, as much at professional level as regional.
Rajchl is most reticent.
“I hope that one reaches an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.”
“One is not the conflict between Bohemians and moravos, but there are attempts to fit the rules to its own convenience.”
“This can consequently have new a blockade of the General Assembly.”
“Anyway, I hope that the common sense will prevail”, Rajchl said.
No longer it is long time so that all the parts reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be realized in Montenegro, but who can know until the party begins if the football team will be complete?
The special-purpose airplane, in that they had to travel to Podgorica, among others vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning by technical problems in the Prague, having had to look for an alternative to transport to part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to they count, will hold this Wednesday.
To Josef Dobeš, minister of Education, Youth and Deportes, it would like much to incorporate to the divided parts the more powerful sport organization of the country so that it reaches an agreement.
There is much in game: the state subsidies, the credibility of soccer and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the Czechoslovakian federation of the sport (ČSTV) that will try to equip with a new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of Sazka lotteries.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because it does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the soccer players of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before extraordinary the General Assembly would know the name a suitable candidate who satisfied all ideas on the new president with the Czech Federation with Fútbol (FAČR), nor she would appear like candidate to a so excellent position.
“If there were an suitable person, it would be fighting by her and it would not present me like candidate to the elections.”
“But until it has today not been possible to find a person thus”, said Paclík for the Agency of Noticias Checa (ČTK)
What motivates to Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking to Pelta, the winning assumption of the elections, that lays the way to the presidency of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR).
Paclík also emphasizes that, in case of winning, it would only remain in the president position until 2013, when would arrive the turn from the ordinary general assembly.
In that position it would like to see an expert and good manager who too much is not related to the soccer events.
“I have already spoken with some people to whom it could consider”.
“For me a madness went to hear to some say that at this moment not even they wish to identify itself with Czech soccer.”
“I would like to change that vision”, she adds.
What supposedly more annoying to Paclík at this moment it is the relation of Pelta with the President of the Association of Regional Soccer of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world like powerful lobista with capacity to influence in the voting of the delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík he is so unacceptable to see Pelta seated in the presidential armchair.
“In case it wins, the effective status would stay and nothing in soccer will change”.
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, soccer will remove still less benefit”, said Paclík.
It also mentions the fact that some ago years the name of Pelta was associated with a monitoring of telephone calls during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta left unpunished.
“I do not know what prestige to soccer could bring the victory of Pelta.”
“And with what eyes it will look at the UEFA and the FIFA to us”, Paclík said, that also it takes with certain precaution his previous declaration that “would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president”.
In the case of gaining the elections of Thursday, Paclík could consider the cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of same opinion he is the other candidate, Rajchl, that has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly of September that finished in a fiasco.
“It (Pelta) would be the first the one that would follow”.
“He is very able.”
“It could imagine to Me, for example, like head of the representation”.
“but not like manager of an association”.
“I do not put the noses either there where I do not feel able”, she added Paclík, that in September provoked much attention to support the suspension of the Commission of Referees presided by Ludek Macel, replaced later by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that it would dare to manage the association.
It resorts to its capacities of management of private enterprises, because from the past summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, that with its support celebrated in May the triumph in first division.
“I have force to change some things in the scope of soccer and to contribute to its safe practice.”
“To reduce the influence of some groups of pressure, that probably trend to influence in the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, producing disagreeable situations, said Paclík without stashing their antipathies towards the president of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities also would be the one to consolidate the relation between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the aid of which it exerted pressure on the political leaders so that they destine more money to the sport of the taxes of the lottery.
“He is one of the problems key to which the new president would be due to dedicate.”
“If they increased the taxes on the games of chance, as the political parties announce it, would support its arguments, but, frankly, they must say to us where it is going to stop all this money”, it indicates.
Furthermore, Paclík now does not consider at least its association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself affirms that the President of the FAČR must be “nonin favor”.
Pelta as well is associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of the Prague.
“He is not ideal.”
“But I do not see sense the fact yield hypocritically my action of the Club of Pilsen to another person soon to return there after a year and a half”, said Paclík.
Pelta promised to the FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Soccer one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, it promised that, in case of being chosen, it would guarantee that the FAČR had some new statutes that served definitively to solve, in the future, the controversies as far as the electoral regulation.
The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic as far as the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and thinks that the pre-electoral conflict could advance today towards a solution with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections nonrealised in September, Pelta promised to concentrate, in case of being chosen, indeed in the representation and collecting bottoms.
It decided to in the last participate minute in the last general assembly, reason why this postponement of two months could go to defend to him well and to present, in a ampler context, its ideas on the management of soccer.
“The people of all the levels take care of soccer already long ago and hope to know this Thursday the new President.”
“They feel that the hour has arrived from which somebody manages the association”, the man thinks who is associated mainly with the Club of Jablonice, but that worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, it creates to have sufficient experience to manage Czech soccer.
It is convinced that behind the current issues with the elections it is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Lamentably, in the general Assembly of June the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as all thought.”
“If we excluded certain interpretations, we already have a president from September”, warned Pelta.
Exactly the readjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used like decoy to gain to the delegates.
“If they choose president to me, I will take it to me as a personal challenge and I am arranged to respond in case this fails.”
“It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist”, Pelta says.
In addition, in theory, it tries not to put with his opponents.
In the past it had already warned that one saw collaborating with Henry Rajchl, to whom it respects by his formation in Right, being conscious that his opponent would be in addition his first vice-president.
It already had been long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave puppet with head.
“It takes more of a year in the soccer world, and it has already achieved some success.”
“Their attacks but were shameful and much people were surprised by the electoral campaign.”
“For that reason many of them doubt on their true character”, it said to his Pelta opponent, who continues being faithful the declarations announced already in September.
Its more powerful weapon is, according to him, its knowledge of soccer, from the lowest competitions to the superiors.
This last one would have to be showcase of promotion of soccer.
“Also, it would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal of the past year.”
“Immediately later it would involve me in the negotiations with the public sector and the private one, to assure that there is sufficient money for all the soccer”, said two months ago to the ČTK the candidate of 46 years.
Next also it promised that his appointment as president of soccer would not tolerate any personal modification of the group.
“It would have to know the first tasks each employee”, it said talking about to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, a comprehensible nervousness reigns.
In spite of the present catastrophic scenes that are predicted before the next general assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not travel this Thursday to Nymburk in vain.
“If the only point of discord is how to vote in the third round, without a doubt we will manage it to surpass.
“Soccer needs credibility, which will only recover if finally it has a leader”, still two days before the most decisive day in its race of representative, Pelta continues being optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under its leadership, the FAČR would begin to work with desire.
If in the fourth General Assembly present vice-president Jindrich Rajchl like new president leaves chosen the Czech Association of Soccer, much people would be surely suffered.
Rajchl promises that, in case of being chosen, it would hard work.
It wants to implement a systematic change and to cause that the members of the executive committee are responsible for each area of soccer individually.
Also it is committed to solve the case of the Bohemians, to improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, to secure to more money soccer and to continue with the work initiated by previous president Ivan Hašek.
“Like president, I would like to dedicate completely to me to soccer”.
“From the international contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection, happening through professional soccer or the training of young soccer players of high performance.”
“With this I do not mean that it would only do it all”, Rajchl in an interview for the ČTK said.
“I am an equipment player and I want to divide the competitions of the executive committee in such a way that each member can be dedicated to a specific area.”
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that soccer can, in each of those segments, to follow by far impulse ahead”.
“To much people this probably it will not like, because it will mean to begin to work very hard and to not only criticize the work of the others”, it added.
Due to the atmosphere of critic in the soccer movement, one says that it has considered the possibility of not appearing again like candidate.
“All know, that work 20 hours daily.”
“But I need to know that this will have sense and that there will be no people behind whom will prevent me and prevent to each step”, it explained therefore the reasons for its indecision.
“Much people have said to me that I do not have to occur by won, because then they would occur by also overcome the others”.
“One is to have faith not to leave thus, immediately”, it said.
According to they say, also motivates to him to continue the work that already began with Hašek.
“During those two years, a great part of the work was finished that I do not want that now it is lost”.
“Processes Exist that had begun and that will have their effect within a pair of years and not would like me that somebody stops them”, announced worried because, if they chose to the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to be as she was before the time of Hašek.
“I believe in the order, and is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him she is mainly all that one people who would take care of soccer so that outside only a privilege for a few choosing.”
“Me a pile of things can be reproached, but not the fact that I am in favor of somebody.”
“Attempt to be objective.”
“I want to make a soccer for all, because therefore all will only feel well and not only the chosen ones”, Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only serious Bohemian the president.
“Although some people try to affirm the opposite, I must in mind make the maximum by Moravia.”
“For example, it is hour to think about the fact to divide to the second division in a Czech part and another one morava, whose winners would go to the first division”.
“The present situation would not occur in which we only have three equipment of Moravia, which represents a problem for the young moravos players”, Rajchl said.
Although to the struggle of the presidential elections Tomaš Paclík was added, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl does not stop believing in its possibilities of being chosen.
“Still I feel to have a fort support of the Czech Federation, which chose to me like its vice-president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes”, she said Rajchl, whose successes understand the saving of some tens of millions of disadvantageous contract crowns, the negotiations of televising contracts and the negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, it recognizes his part of fault in which the federation is not united.
And while it proclaims that Pelta “is disqualified to recover the confidence in Czech soccer”, it considers the other rival, Paclík, like a strong candidate who yes has something to offer to soccer.
“Nobody can deny that it did a great work by the Pilsen that one year”.
“In case it is chosen, probably it will follow what already Ivan nonexchange Hašek began significantly and the group of the personnel in the committees.”
“I do not want to use that favor”, it thus evaluates his Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools of Europe
Jump to the blue one
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible optics, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Who visits Europe can live his blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a long walk, to rest its legs tired in effervescent baths.
A book shows where is the best well-being in the water.
When Iris Meder realized an investigation trip during the passed year and a half, there was something could not lack in its luggage, a bathing suit.
Fallen down of backs on the water, it looked at the artistic dome in the stop, swam towards the marble angelfishes, that waited for it in the edge of the swimming pool and it was astonished meticulously before the covered swimming pool modernist recovered.
It liked the bath, took note in its notebook at the time of all the interesting details on the style and history from the building.
The architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools this way and she presents them in its recent book “Badefreuden”: the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historical palaces of the bath in the Black Forest, the “constructions of concrete” in Taunus.
It realized its “trip by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe” by 13 countries: Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and the Croatia.
This German of 46 years is true an enthusiastic one of the culture of the bath.
It does not want to have nothing to do with the sport, says Meder, the water it is only different.
It only bothers to him that the fans to the bath must be satisfied to blue tiles and stench to chlorine, whereas the fans to run can breathe the fascinating scent of the forests of firs or listen to the glad trills of the birds in the park.
“A day I wondered myself why the swimming pools must be always so ugly”, it affirms this inhabitant of Vienna.
“I began to collect beautiful swimming pools.”
The surface of the water duplicate the architecture.
I wade in the swimming pool and ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the swimming pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the constructor strives, the covered swimming pools can be a true gift for the view: “Instead of ground, in the baths a water surface is had.”
“On the one hand he is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of all the building.”
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colors, the springboards.
The book with photographies in format small “Badefreuden” provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and the history of the art in the historical oases of the well-being, but, mainly, gives desire to jump to the blue one.
Meder, the collector of swimming pools discovers the outstanding units in its investigations in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath of Széchenyi of Budapest, of 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a singular karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some spas, whose alkaline swimming pools are of waters and they are in a building with bottle form (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city puts the eyes in the put a roof on swimming pool of Zurich, it is possible to be looked at Arlberb, cover of snow, from the outer swimming pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which the practice in the ski tracks can be observed.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary delay to the clients in Längenfeld: The cathedral of the water of Ötztal seems a ufo that finishes landing in the Alps.
Of three open sources it raises to steam in winter, whereas basic mountains of Ötztal are raised in the sky.
Alhambra in the Negra Forest
To Meder, the collector of swimming pools, did not invade the scent to him to chlorine in all the swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague to gasohol is so strong that people create to have arrived at a sanitary bath.
The scent comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose slime sticks to the skin when entering the swimming pool, a benefit of the well-being of a special way.
Iris Meder also was disappointed in a place in their search of beautiful places for the bath, when she wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sun baths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, was with a blocked land.
The bath of 1902 of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the worn down windows of the red modernist building, white and yellow, it saw the weeds grow between tiles.
The decay resisted in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind himself\; not only neoRomance elements of times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, addition in 1900 can be discovered.
From its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because he is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has much merit to fuse different architectonic styles in a so fantastic unit”, affirms Meder.
In a palace therefore the immersion in the thermal swimming pool apparently it does not have much importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of the raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Resign does Deutsche Bank to its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann it has ordered a work group to verify the consequences of the speculation for the poor men of the world.
In January, the head of the partnership wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens, the subject is clear, according to a study, to the 84 percent of the Germans it does not seem to them acceptable that the banks speculate on with the agricultural raw materials like the wheat or the maize.
Two thirds of the survey ones vindicate that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions retire of this business because intensifies the problems of poorest of the world.
This it is the result of a survey by order of the organization of Foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on a presented report to Foodwatch in the middle of October.
Author Harald Schumann sample that the bets on the bags of global raw materials make raise the prices, and the banks load with the responsibility of the global problems of the hunger.
The campaign of the defender of the consumer goes in particular to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the great banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley acts of similar way.
Originally, the bets on raw materials thought to protect the retailers of the oscillations of the prices.
The main experts agree in which the players have disconnect of the supplies and demands, and remove gains from the costs of poorest.
Ackermann reacted differently before the critics that the American competitors: He promised to review the vindications and he said that no business “deserves to jeopardize good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL information ONLINE, an international work group is reviewing the vindications of the report of Foodwatch.
The analysis must be finalized at the end of year, then the results to the directive of Deutsche Bank will appear, along with the recommendation of how handling the subject.
At the end of January, the direction of the bank will inform into the consequences.
In the end a reduction of the business of the raw materials could occur, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but it reaffirmed its critics to the financial sector: “The bets to increasing prices of foods show of especially drastic way how the ruthless banks harm the public well-being at the moment.”
Ackermann is like the greater banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
“Deutsche Bank must annul all the investments of its portfolio in which it puts into play the money for bets of food prices”, it affirmed Bode.
“It gives equal if Ackermann deals with the subject the people who pass hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the partnership wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his position.
Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the president of the board will change something different from not planned in the administration advice.
With the abandonment of the controverted agrarian speculation it can perfect his image.
And it needs that as soon as concerns possible losses to him, of that his successor will take care.
Two thirds would annul the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives in maintaining discharge the pressure on the manager.
Until the moment, more than 30,000 internauts they have participated in the campaign of the organization.
Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people 7 and 8 of November.
The 10 percent hardly considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments in which the prices of foods were bet.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when discovering that its bank participated in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would annul all the investments which it leaves money of the agrarian speculation.
The 43 percent would thus advise against a bank to their knowing, the 49 percent would solicit, after reflecting, to annul their account and it would change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The transferred pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with bumps and a happy end, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 obtained prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, it remained empty and it crumbled.
Now one reopens like house of exhibitions.
The modern architecture of postgerra gets passionate, the clear forms, halls of crystal, the brave curves and the new construction equipments, typical of the thought on the technical progress, so, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is a suitable and known example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer obtained then the Grand Prix de Arquitectura by its slight and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction considers until the present time a contemporary landmark of the architecture.
It made the so well-known architect that also he constructed the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, it internationally happened to be known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions rose after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the station of the south of Vienna, reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of century 20 was inaugurated, was called “house 20”.
The building was suitable but it lacked the suitable spaces and technology for a museum\; without no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
In spite of it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty from 2001 and decays more and more.
At the moment, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now “house 21” calls it and it will be used in the future like museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday in the evening the museum was inaugurated belvedere, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arc, the new director of the Austrian gallery belvedere from 2007, obtained a new beginning.
Husslein-Arc, among other things, do PhD in history of the art with a considerable race artistic skater on ice in its youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern art of Salzburg, realized the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided bottoms private sponsoring public and established their use.
With the exception of the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exposed, must have a cafeteria and a bookstore and in addition to be constructed a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best election to do it.
Not only because it reformed of sensible way the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, it extended it and the contest was sold him, if because it studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion it was not for him a “important and immense place”, in which contemplated “almost to all the week ends” the exhibitions.
It knew the project and the problem the building, that disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and facility.
In the present reforms there are great problems, the building was “an all-consuming one of energy”, said Krischanitz.
The profile of the windows of the crystal facade changed, a reinforced insulating crystal with fiber glass settled and the crystal ceiling was replaced by a special bullet-proof glass.
The thermal bridges and the steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two cellars were used for the new use, a panel of light descended between the house and the street provides the illumination, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the pavilion of Schwanzer.
They remain the original outer doors, the house is guinea fowl in old tones mahogany and protégée against the oxidation.
And the room of cinema is exactly like was before.
And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a low budget.
“Often it had to find material that outside good, cheap and also liked to the office of monument protection”, affirms Krischanitz and warns of a rough ground in the cellar.
In spite of all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building stays flexible and light.
The one of the pavilion “that wine of Brussels” has been difficult, affirmed Krischanitz, a typical “drop in the history of the city recently”.
An architecture thus is “always in the mistaken place” and for that reason it wanted “to wake up brings back to consciousness suitable”.
In this case house 21 is not in the mistaken place, has happened a city-planning stroke of luck. Totally the new one and planned “district of the central station”, with houses and offices, are next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary art Berlin citizen and, as she is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that ascends to million
The company has devised a crisis plan, that would avoid the failures of the trains in winter.
The number of personnel must bend.
What million cost.
In the fight against the failures and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has been spent in this year more than 70 million Euros, according to a journalistic news article.
The newspaper “Bild” informed, invoking an internal plan of crisis of the group, of the investments anticipated until 2005 of a total of around 300 million Euros.
So one better availability of the vehicles and the railway network with an extreme time is due to still obtain.

The objective is to clean to the platforms of snow and ice for the operation and the 90 percent of the necessary needles for the operation in the term of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, also warned of failures and delays in the trains during this winter after a summit with the government and the industry.
The winter past Deutsche Bahn underwent considerable problems in carriage of passengers, since, among other things, it needed reserves before adverse meteorological conditionses.
Many new regional trains take to years hoping an authorization of the railway federal office.
In addition there is a delay in the delivery of the high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn works from years in frequently verifying the axes of the high-speed trains in the factory, after a high-speed train underwent the breakage of an axis in the central station of Colony.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the EE.UU.
After the tumult on president Josef Ackermann, it appears a new problem of the EE.UU., Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not sufficient for the Deutche Bank, its past in the EE.UU acquires the giant of the sector, the Institute of Frankfurt pays 145 million dollars (106 million Euros) in an agreement, to end the fights due to the bankruptcy of five great cooperatives of credit during the financial crisis.
One is the sale of hypothecating titles.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA recriminates to many great banks to induce to the cooperatives of credit with false promises to buy financial products\; they have diminished the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and drag to the banks to the depths.
“We are satisfied with being able to clarify the subject without the parts must go to the courts”, a spokesman of Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also is applied to Citigroup, that forced a payment of 20.5 million dollars.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the credit cooperatives of the EE.UU and supports in case of bankruptcy to protect the investments of clients.
The NCUA tries to refund the originated losses of million.
The agreements at the moment closed are their first type.
The regulator also had requested accounts to other great banks and in established summer lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the subject of the doubtful hypothecating titles, values endorsed by mortgages are the calls.
These are based on credits house.
When the housing bubble of the EE.UU exploded in 2007, it took to undoing to many financial organizations.
In September of 2008, in the algid point of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened some years ago, at the moment blows a complicated wind for the American banks.
The investors and the inspection have established countless processes to receive indemnifications or to sanction lack.
The Federal Agency of Funding of House (FHFA in its abbreviations in English) has produced the greater amount of demands.
It reproaches to the 18 great international banks that the two hypothecating agencies state Americans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage the business of the mortgages in a volume of approximately 200 billions of dollars.
Also Deutsche Bank has a demand of the FHFA, is businesses for 14.2 billions of dollars about year 2005 to the 2007.
The inspection demands that the Institute of Frankfurt responds of “the substantial losses”, without naming an exact number.
Deutsche Bank rejected the unfounded debts as and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes with 10 billions to IBM
The guru of finances, Buffett, invests with force in the company of Technologies of the IBM Information.
From March it has acquired action for more than ten billions of dollars.
Until now the great American investor Warren Buffett always has declared not to invest in companies of computers nor Technologies of the Information since the prognoses of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But it has read the report commercial of IBM and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
It had to understand long before that IBM offers services mainly and tries systems of computers for the departments of Technologies of the Information of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment of Warren Buffett is considered like an honor.
Therefore, the primitive one of Technologies of the Information must be called “Sir IBM”.
Buffett kept awake at the moment in the transmitter of economy CNBC that has acquired action of IBM for 10.7 thousands of million dollars from March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway of investments has ascended in this way to one of the majors shareholders of IBM with a participation of the 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM did not know anything of the commitment until now.
It praised to the direction that took care of the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They have done a brilliant work”, affirmed Buffett on the strategy.
IBM established for some time the services of lucrative Technologies of the Information like the operation of computer centers.
The old computer science pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advising as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided the technology companies to date.
It said that only it invested in companies whose businesses understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns near approximately 80 own branchs, as well as part of a whole series of great partnerships like Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, of 81 years, became position of the textile small business Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and, with wise investments, it extended it until turning it into one of the most valuable companies of the world.
However, its lifestyle is humble.
For that reason it is an idol for innumerable investors worldwide.
Its express and infallible sense to make money have provided him the nickname of “oracle of Omaha”.
After discovering the investment of Buffett, the actions of IBM in stock market raised a one percent.
“The blue giant”, as it is known IBM, has a value in stock market of more than 220 billions of dollars and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, between the more valuable companies of technology of the world.
With Microsoft, it affirmed Buffett, it does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat takes shape
After the discovery of “the cell of Zwickau”, the Turkish mass media doubt the German rule of law.
A periodic speech of a “bloody ideology” that it returns to revive itself.
The murders of eight small businessmen Greek tricks and between years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin one has reacted with fear and preoccupation before this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin a ghost returns that was believed dead a long time ago, from the attacks with fire form in Mölln in November of 1992 and Solingen in May of 1993, had not happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against Turks.
However, never it has been questioned that in Germany exists xenophobia.
The discovered extreme right-wing network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, far from it, foreseeable.
“Return to revive itself the bloody does ideology? ”, titles the edition by Internet of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk”.
The newspaper “Sabah” stands out on the contrary that one of the authors of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and it is worried so that the German authorities can be implied in the extreme right-wing pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with good sense, the weekend remembered to the victims of the racist violence with a watch before the Door of Brandenburgo.
Two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin along with the politicians German and Turks reflected in a solemn act of the fifty anniversary in the agreement Turk-German.
The coexistence was put in scene with glad colors, like a history with happy end.
The information arrived at some average Turks like a slap: “The German gift by the fifty anniversary”, says the title of an article in the Turkish platform of Internet “To have X”, talking about to the background of the chain of murders.
The German emission “Hürriyet” does not insist either on drawing up this mental connection.
“It begins to smell badly”, says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It stands out that the assassinated ones were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the forums of Internet of German of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its later success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished of which the German authorities have not looked for long before suspicious in the circle of the extreme right.
Some is at least rhetorical as far as drastic means: “From now on it is lost here, to the immigrants they do not have left more than the self-defense and the armament”.
“This will be the best self-protection”.
“Internal La Paz of Germany depends strongly on the quality of the explanation and the adjustment of the sanction to all the network”. , “Selen” writes.
What means that, if internal La Paz of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been recorded in the memories German and Turkish.
No other event showed the Turks more clearly who live here that there is a threat makes specific and, to the Germans, who the distrust and the distance can end at the violence.
The attacks worsen the feeling of group of the Turkish part.
Not to repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press the deficiency of the German policy was criticized mainly then after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack with fire form of Solingen he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his minister of Foreign Affairs, replaced it in the funeral of Colony. Kinkel detailed in its speech which contributes with the taxes the Turks of Germany.
It is clear how the value of a person calculates according to the amount of its taxes.
The present information of the average Turks returns to show the deep thing that is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
Besides the effort of an ample explanation and a revaluation of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, this time they make lack frank words.
The bank of the scandal of the lake of Zurich
The most dangerous bank of Europe is not in Italy nor France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS almost entered bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then it slid of a crisis the following one.
Now a German directs it.
Certainly Axel Weber had not thought it.
After his spectacular game of the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 it would begin in a new one and almost also of spectacular work: President of the administrative advice of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative passage in its race.
Axel Weber is glad publicly, praises Switzerland by his beauty and to UBS by his just acquired solidity and drops amiable observations on his future companions.
“USB has obtained a revitalization”.
“It cheers to Me to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel”.
In September it was clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and defrauded 1.7 billions of Euros.
Oswald Grübel, general director of USB, a banker not only met in Switzerland, had to go.
The president of the administrative advice of USB also considered himself since then touched, and all asked: When arrive does Axel Weber?
It was known that Weber will have to advise to the bank from February of 2012.
And position of the presidency of the administrative advice in May, not at the beginning of 2013 will become, as the bank communicated Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not banker, rather, professor of economy and adviser and has had a surely necessary period of adaptation.
Of blow person in charge of the strategy of a bank becomes, that finishes returning to try that the greater bank of the scandal of Europe deserves the title for a long time “”.
On the one hand, USB is enormous, until recently he was the greater world-wide administrator of goods, and on the other hand, for years, it slides of a scandal the following one.
Nothing, therefore seems it, is saved to him long ago to the so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent fame until 2007.
The image of discreet and solid, but also adroit the administrator of goods Swiss, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a great number in the investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 trillions of dollars, USB manages more money of wealthy clients who any other bank of the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced like investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This makes an impression.
Hans Geiger, the old banker and later professor of bank in Zurich during many years explain: “Before my students, always I have described to USB like model of a good bank.”
“From the present point of view, one is asked: How it could mistake to me”
It was in a great error.
In 2007 it came to the light that something left very badly in USB.
In the middle of year, Peter Wuffli, general director, who until then was considered like a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprising.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The investment fund of the bank embarked in losses with titles of high risk and had to amortize thousands of million.
In order to load with this, USB don't mention it announced an injection of capital less than of 13 billions of francs.
For this it found investors, naturally that some looked with scorn until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state bottom of Singapore and an Arab state bottom, so discreet, that its name had been heard never.
This era only the first blow.
In April of 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of million, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative advice, in 2006 in the second better paid administrative advice of Switzerland, resigned.
In October of 2008, it continued the catastrophe, in view of its mistaken investments, UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought problematic values to UBS by many thousands of million, the Helvetic Confederation gave six thousands of million francs by an obligatorily convertible bond, by means of which it became co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, affirmed the dramatic thing that he was this for a small country, if lodges to so great banks.
Finally the sum of the balance of UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland (to see graph).
“We cannot return to rescue to UBS”, it said Geiger, expert in bank.
To the first catastrophe it was united second.
Few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and it was arranged to give the data of the wealthy clients, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a number of 780 thousands of million dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted benefits of these businesses with an indemnification by payment.
In this way, UBS more or less confessed to have helped in the fiscal fraud.
Simultaneously it lost something that had been from always its capital in the competition by rich clients: the discretion aureole.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank no longer is the same.
This it followed the resignation of the president of the board and the president of the administrative advice.
And the exodus of the bottoms of the clients.
This way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank by means of the erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods by means of the aid to the fiscal fraud.
And right when it returned to be something calmer, just when this unfortunate history of the operator thought that UBS returned to obtain it, happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billions of Euros, before the bank realized of which something went bad.
And one kept awake, by the sight, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment bank.
“With the Adoboli case one pronounces that the risk controls have changed too much little”, it affirms Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finances in the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a great German bank also is safe: “The problem of UBS is that it does not dominate the risk controls”.
Reason why the idea arose from the precaution, with which the Swiss bankers appeared for a long time, to be the guardians of the greater good of the world: no too great risk, however, the security of the money wants to break to the other side of the alpine republic.
The deposits of security of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unshakeable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The power station of UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliche of the solid Swiss private bank, is only a little greater.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, that goes directly from the main station to the lake of Zurich, framed by summits covered with snow of Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of highest of Europe.
Here are jewelry shops like Tiffany ` s between Swiss traditional businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Here the Swiss banks reside for years: from the National Bank, happening through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elitarios private banks like Julius Bär.
One enters the room of reception of UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are had with marble, ahead are great leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank is a great signboard to indicate the “security”.
UBS knows what the client looks for here: Security.
Both great Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some time are displaced the idea of the great Swiss bank, or they have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
It prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all it does, like all the Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both great banks.
UBS has become too great, thinks, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have taken terrain.
There Swiss did not have nothing else to say.
“And they are had customary during long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.”
In fact, UBS changed the British investment bank, gave his first great gain and soon the disaster came, no European financial organization was lost as much money in the jungle of the high risk like the great Swiss bank.
The 15 of October of 2008, the catastrophe were evident.
“That Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greater rescue operation in the history of its nation”, writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “Der UBS-Crash” (“the crash of UBS” in Spanish).
The politicians granted up to 68 thousands of million francs or approximately 45 thousands of million Euros to save to the great bank of the bankruptcy.
How it is happened to them?
It is spoken with the Swiss bankers, thus see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June of 1998, two of the three great Swiss banks megre in a powerful partnership.
It arises a bank that, due to the fusion, was too great for the small Switzerland, and continues growing.
Reason why it served so that both different precursory banks from UBS were complemented: a bank rich but sleepy with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer internationalization but more fort.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks in a timely manner arrived by far money, with which they could make roll a great financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the partnership of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative advice.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect equipment”, the expert in bank Hans Geiger says.
“Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one that was able to break through from the learning in the bank to the summit.”
Finally, Ospel was entrusted in Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli committed probably a decisive error: “It thought that their models were a reality”, Geiger says.
“It is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The mistake arrived before the case.
The employees of UBS remember the manager meetings clearly, in which Wuffli, the head of the partnership, always repeated the same motto: To lower of the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the more powerful investment bank of the world.
They headed the “League Tables”, the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be in the summit.
Some steps came out to him well.
In the currency operations and the negotiation of action it was in highest.
Nevertheless, in charge advisers of companies put of relief a weakness: In the business of the international interest, in the bank language “fixed income”, has an enormous indemnification for the great banks.
UBS has emptinesses in American hypothecating products.
In order to fill these emptinesses, UBS began an adventure that almost costs its existence to him.
Eager for growth, they invested the same bank as much as one of its created funds of high risk in American investments of high risk.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to titularizar American hypothecating credits and to sell them next, maintaining certain risks against the account own.
And also, as other banks looked for the slope during long time.
“In summer of 2007, as the American real estate market were in flames, UBS bought there”, it said Geiger, expert in bank.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to go away, since the attempt to order was more complicated than they hoped.
The positions in UBS became projectable seats and are uncertain until the present time.
At the moment, who manages a great bank, it has an almost impossible work.
It must find a strategy for a bank, before which all the logical models of business are lost.
Geiger, expert in banks, have an idea, to end the investment bank, to concentrate themselves in the administration of goods, to return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to arrive so far (still).
But the investment bank must fall much, is clearly at the moment.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, it will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, one only thought about the Italian-Swiss of 51 years like a transitory solution, since the bank the bank separated surprising of its Grübel predecessor.
Meanwhile, he prevailed: He must permanently direct the businesses of UBS, communicated the bank of Zurich Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to give back to the investment bank to its state in the middle of the ninety.
It suppresses 3,500 positions.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is?
With what it wants to make money?
These are the questions that surely are made Axel Weber at the moment.
Until the moment it only says that first it will look for a house with his wife in Zurich.
The following year.

What skepticism between the American investors created: “We are not an island, if nonemployees”, said Steve Goldman de Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly of a recession, in addition there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of the investments, only confirmed this precaution, still is not clear if Europe is sufficiently strong to do all the necessary one to end the crisis, affirmed in an interview for the CNBC.
For that reason, from its point of view it is too much soon for investing in state loans or European banks.
Instead of that, it throws overboard one decade of old principles and enters the American technological sector.

Intelligent rooks extend in the cities
In many sites the rooks consider “problematic birds”: it is not expelled to these animal inteligentísimos of the cities during long time, affirm the experts.
To some like, others want they to get rid very fast of them, the rooks belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors by the nastiness and the noise of the animal are accumulated.
Although it has not appeared any means against the “problematic birds” until now.
The rooks no longer leave the cities, affirm the experts in the first symposium on rooks in Reading, Eastern Friesland.
There the specialists of all the national territory discuss on possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
The ecologists attribute the problems from the cities to the migration of the field of certain protected rooks\; the chemical applications in agriculture end the traditional vital spaces visibly.
The hunting, the increasing construction and the fall of trees that provide with accomodations them make difficult the life of the birds.
The rooks are protected.
There are great colonies with more than 600 reproductive pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Reading.
There in 2005 a controverted project jumped to the negative holders of the press to kill in mass to the rooks of the district.
The critics have described the hunting as the animal by means of traps for birds and the murder with woods like especially brutal.
“Expelling them and driving away them of normal way nothing is obtained” showed Werner Klöver, city planner and landscaper To read.
To shoot with water to the nests or to throw the trees usually is consequences nonwished, also affirms Manfred Kaiser, expert in environment of Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
“The animal are turned aside, the great colonies of divide and distribute in other places.”
To drive away them is only imaginable like exception in hospitals, old residences of or schools.
“We must live with them, no longer we catched them.”
Without the environs, the problem in the cities is not solved, thinks Wolfgang Kellner, mayor To read.
A combination to drive away to the animal of sensible residential zones and baits is possible so that they return to be based in other places.
“Informative Panels instead of mountain ranges of chain” Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist make publicity against in order that he treats to the animal of a totally different form: “The best thing is than we can hold a tip in the face with seriousness.”
Jürgens was based on Schleswig-Holstein the circuit of education on the rooks of Ascheberger, where signboards inform on the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by the tourists.
Jürgens also has its own opinion on the critics by the noise of the birds: “Everything is communication forms, must much say.”
The intelligence and ability of these animal are legendary, the rooks not only take advantage of the resources to accede to mouthfuls schists, if not that make tools to use them like resources.
Recently, etólogos of the University of Cambridge verified in four rooks until where intelligence arrives from the birds.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to drop a stone on a platform thus to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and the form that must have the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the astute rooks had to solve a complicated problem.
The investigators placed a small bucket with a larva of moth in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not arrive at their prey with the tip.
But the investigators left a wire piece them.
With that the four animal formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the gunner of the tube.
Three of the cuatros rooks obtained it in the first attempt.

Massacre at personal level
Intense and generous the new book of Peter Englund, the beauty and the pain the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate history about World War I, “begins with one releases dramatis personae of the type who can cause that to one the soul on the feet falls to him.
There are some advice of action here: Soft boot this page and turns it into its brand pages.
It will get to know these people very well in the novelistic narration of Mr. Englund, and this dramatis personae will work like its GPS, a light during those few moments at which, like one of its men and women, confused and it is abandoned in the fog of the war.
Mr. Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
Also he is the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, that grants the Nobel prize de Literatura.
What it has written here is a little current book, that it describes, rightly, like “a work of anti-history”.
It contains some remarkable names, important treaties or famous battles\; practically there are no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or material.
It is not as much a book about what it happened, explains, as “a book about how it happened”. It tries about “feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor”.
“The beauty and the pain the battle “more or less combine the experiences in the days of war of 20 men and ordinary women, to both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, conductors of ambulance and office staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or will lose their members, they will become crazy or die.
Their lives blink here as ignited votive candles in a church\; some new are added to the mixture while others go out.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation of books of standard history.
He is also a corrective one to the notion of which World War I was only the unfortunate trench war in the Western Front.
“The beauty and the pain the battle” move of expert form through other theaters military: the Alps, the Balkan Mountains, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, Africa of the East.
To the soldiers in this book the beehives fall to them above\; one spends Christmas in Egypt under pyramids\; the flies tse-tse are an untreatable problem.
This one is a stirring book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that stinks out to cordite.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, you remain or you flee?
In any case who comes?
Nobody almost understands what it is happening, not even why must fight this war.
“Deficiency of facts”, observes Mr. Englund, “has filled up with conjectures, suppositions, hopes, fear, fixed ideas, theories of the conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and rumors”.
“The beauty and the pain the battle” follow individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the fleet of high seas.
Their histories have been obtained to a large extent from memories, letters and another material already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be frightful or stirring, but they are fuller of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and of arreglárselas and so there is.
About counting the history of a German schoolgirl it says: “Substitute, throughout substitute”.
“Substitute of coffee, false aluminum, rubber of imitation, bandage of paper, wood bellboys.”
It continues speaking of the substitute food in Germany.
It describes “to meat done from cooked rice and pressing in sheep fat (and ended with a false bone done of wood)\; tobacco made of roots and peelings of dry potatoes\; shoes with wood soles”.
There are, they observe, “837 allowed substitutes of the meat in the sausage production, 511 registered substitutes of the coffee”.
Some histories are about the honor and the value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards the savagery and declares about the war: “You feel that, after all, this is so the men are conceived and a cigarette and a whiskey, the newspaper of afternoon or best do not stop to sit down in armchairs with to seller, and to try that varnish means civilization and that there is no a Barbarian behind that starchy and tachonada pechera.”
However a British soldier realizes of which probably he will die, and which nobody will find out or he will matter to him.
“Once one is resigned to the thought to sacrifice itself, to one it would like to think that it could happen in front of the public”, it writes.
However, he is horribly similar “to the condemned being strangled privily”.
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and new types of terror.
“The conflict has become more and more an economic competition”, writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories”.
It reflects the arrival than it calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The assassin in mass eloquent and convinced ideologically with clothes of good preparation that executes its slaughter while it is seated behind a writing-desk”.
People bucket of unexpected ways\; there is as much base behavior as heroic.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to take a venereal disease of prostitutes as he forms to evade the service in the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the commerce of gonocócico pus, that the soldiers buy and in this way smear their genitals with the hope to finish in the hospital”, he writes.
“Those that are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often gives rise to a blindness of by life.”
In this translation of Swedish done by Peter the Serious ones, the prose of Mr. agile but nonoutlandish Englund, perfectly is adapted to its human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to “untied exceptionally uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I often have been indirect, like the Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Without newness in the front of Erich Maria It observes, instead of integral histories.
The volume of Mr. Englund is united to a little conventional pantheon.
Its book has one of the end more devastating than I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if that page of dramatis personae had arrived from its book, uprooted among your fingers, and it would have burned it with a match.
After a false step previous, an assault planned to the minute
Hundreds of policemen were involved, some of them taking antiriot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be emptier.
The operation stayed privily safe for a few high ranking officials, saying initially to the others that were being united to an exercise.
The inspector of Raymond police W. Kelly was in center, his presence emphasized how the operation was plagued of challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, like the pulverization of espray pepper on the demonstrators, infringing the norms of the department and creating a storm of public affection towards “okupas”.
And for that reason the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of demonstrators revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents were preparation seeing since the occupations in other cities had been developed.
A maneuvers of greater catastrophe was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the call training of disorders - measured contraterroristas that implied to mobilize quickly to a great number of police officials - to concentrate in the Lower Manhattan.
The last session of training was at night of Monday, in the side of Manhattan of the East river.
You order them to enter the park arrived in the “last minute”, said somebody familiarized with the orders, that only talked about to the mission like “an exercise”.
“To the few polis that I know that they were called for this, did not say to them that was to enter the Zuccotti park”, the person said, that she spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew that they were going to enter the Zuccotti park were in the high levels of the department.”
A reason for the excessive secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
The 14 of October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they stopped when hundreds of demonstrators arose before time after to have heard about the plans.
The operation of Tuesday implied agents of several police units, including special forces of all the municipal district - tens of movable agents who habitually used to flood the districts with high index of criminality.
Mr. Kelly said that much people, like that they travel daily to the work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, were the 1 a.m. a good hour to enter.
“Appropriate Era to do it when it was the smaller number of people in the park”, said.
Trucks of the Unit of Services in emergency with centers and loudspeakers congregated in the crossing of Pike Underpants with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages that resounded from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
The agents of communitarian subjects went clearly to the park with their blue windbreaks, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and they went away.
Any store was not touched until the 1:45 a.m., said to the police, giving time to the demonstrators to pick up its properties.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if it were needed to make haltings in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman head of the Department of Police, said that he was by his security.
But many journalists said that she tried herself to avoid that they saw the police conduct battle in the park, and who had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the movable units of television in Church Street, throughout the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved towards the west through the dense maze of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and garbage bags of jammed paper and plastic of clothes, equipment of the Department of Cleaning followed to them, gathering what it was left back.
Some demonstrators who refused to move went outside dragged, appearing images in Internet just a short time later.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the zone from kitchen of the camping, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Around some 10 people in the epicenter of the camping locked themselves among them by the arms.
And two people were chained trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The agents of the service of emergency were called to cut the padlocks.
Arrests in the park were not made more or less until the 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The operation of clearing was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were by “alteration of the public order and resistance to the authority”, it said.
The agent of more high rank in the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives of the department, also was there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, “was not directing the operations”, said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents hoped throughout the Eastern side of Broadway, between the streets Liberty and Cedar, in case they had to enter.
Barricades in the street Cortlandt, a block to the north of the park were raised, and in the street Pine, a block to the south.
From those positions, the perimeter beyond the Zuccotti park was even seen the police extending.
At a certain time, a series of agents, many of them with shields, was seen pushing people outwards.
There were some 28 people in the North perimeter.
Some of the noisiest action at night took place to the south of the park.
Around the 5 a.m., to the south of the Pine street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others it was seen them clearing the air of the wheels of a police van.
At a certain time, a plywood piece left flying from the multitude.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will demand to the city by the dismissals
The union that represents hundreds of support workers scholastic which they lost his uses the past month glides to demand to the city Wednesday, alleging that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their out of proportion impact on the schools that take care of poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two assistants of the school, the coordinators of parents and other employees who between the worse one were paid of the city lost their work the 7 of October, in a movement that the union leaders have described like a political revenge by their refusal to allow, the last spring, the access on the part of the city to a bottom of medical assistance in charge of work groups to close their budgetary breach.
The municipal authorities have denied that accusation categorically.
In a hearing in the City council the last month, the adviser of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dismissals were a part of the budget adopted in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked saying to him that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the personnel of support of the school would be dismissed.
Civil servants of municipal district 37 said that they made the complaint in writing, warning to the Department of Education of which he would be demanded. Wednesday will be celebrated a press conference to announce the official presentation of the demand, in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include to Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city like defendant, and has eight workers dismissed like plaintiffs, all of them black or Latin women, like the majority of the assistants who lost their uses.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore it could not make commentaries on his specific allegations.
According to a rough draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has concentrated in the number of dismissals in the schools of poor zones of the city to support a claim by unjust treatment, saying that the poor schools lost more assistants, since insufficiently they had been subsidized of chronic form.
It is indicated that although were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in the schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 scholastic assistants lost their uses in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed to Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by State school 36 in Harlem, where the 68 percent of the students lives in the poverty, the demand says, “This is not a district of wealthy parents who can collect bottoms to cover the budget deficit”.
P.D. The budget of district 36 was reduced in a 3.26 percent this year, and also it lost money when the city changed the form in which it calculates the additional financing for each matriculation by poor student in the schools.
The union also affirms that the secondary directors of an institution can be deceived by the language in a memorandum that authorizes the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memorandum used the word “surplus” to describe the action, although “surplus” describes the act most frequently to transfer to a teacher of the list from a school to an employment agency, whose pays are paid by the central office.
“Sixty six coordinators of parents were dismissed”, says the rough draft of the complaint, “and not only in surplus”.
Finished mission, the Congress preparation to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that finally republican and democratic in the Capitol they are arranged to put itself in agreement on something related to the rise in Libya.
Everything what era was needed that the rebellion was successful, that veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and assassinated and the participation of the United States he arrived at his aim.
Tuesday, the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the Senate is going to consider a resolution, sponsored by president John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), along with senators John McCain (republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding to the Libyans by its successful rebellion and to the troops of EE.UU by its “bravery”.
“This resolution is to honor to the brave ones of Libya, when beginning to reconstruct its country”, said Kerry.
“It is an affirmation of two-party support for its democratic aspirations.”
The language can seem inoffensive, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought themselves to each other and with the White House on the writing of a series of resolutions to approve or to reject the paper of the military of EE.UU in the mission of NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the limited use of troops of EE.UU in Libya.
The law project was defeated in the Camera by an ample two-party margin, and that never got to vow in the Senate.
But the same day in which the law project was rejected in the Camera, the camera also rejected a measurement that would have trimmed the bottoms for the American operations in Libya.
That one left the mission of EE.UU in a species of legislative purgatory - with the sufficiently annoying Congress as to criticize the handling on the part of Obama of the mission, but not as angry as in fact to harvest the grass under its feet.
Next, the indecision of the Congress was surpassed by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was assassinated the 20 of October.
The mission of NATO finished the 31 of October officially.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee of Foreign Affairs “congratulates to the town of Libya by its tremendous anger and extraordinary resistance to free itself to themselves” and “praises to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and to their partners of the coalition who participated in military operations to protect to the town of Libya by their extraordinary bravery and professionalism”.
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in Libya.”
Gain the new will measurement the complete support of the commission of Foreign Affairs, or will divide to the legislators since it made the project of June law?
The last version was rejected by senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main republican of the committee.
The spokesman of Place said Monday that she had still not seen the final version of the new project of law.
To the other side of the Capitol, the Camera is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment being demanded a well-balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the republican congressmen and some democrats.
The measurement, sponsored by the republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that in fact obtains a voting of all the assembly in the Camera or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful until the moment to make arrive their amendments at the assembly, but not for want of attempts.
The one of Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which they include an ample range of subjects.
Some are duplicated - the same project of law sets out so much in the Camera as in the Senate - and others with slight variations to each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance only in the Camera, and another handful that “the federal spending will control.”
Some of those projects of law are also identical to each other, but they give his sponsoring - mainly republican novices whom they look for to refine his curricula - opportunity to boast itself of which they were the “authors” of this measurement.
The Law of Control of Budget, that was adopted in August, required that the Camera as much as the Senate voted an amendment of the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a nonbinding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that the members of the Congress can fulfill, whereas the representative Mountain Jose E. (democratic by New York), wants to clear the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr (democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to an education of quality and health care, among others subjects.
An amendment that prohibits the homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that the burning fire of flags prohibits.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of the federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that they have been the members at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moving to a rate faster than in previous years.
In 111º Congress, the legislators proposed 77 modifications, and presented 66 in 110º.
The rate is unacceptable in comparison with the one of the decade of 1990, when the members presented regularly more than 150 amendments every two years, according to numbers provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they were not much more successful then than they have it now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact she was propose by the Congress in 1789.
“Struck but not defeated,” Giffords speaks in his first interview in TV from the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot to him to point-blank in a constitutional act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democratic by Arizona) appeared in the national television the night of Monday, he sang accompanied of the melody of Broadway “the sun he will leave tomorrow” and he said that he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to the Congress.
In its appearance in ABC News “20/20”, with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form orations and needed aid to walk.
The program documented its difficult way of return of the damages caused by a bullet that fractured the skull to him and perforated the left side of its brain, and that passage from the front to the later part of its head.
Three months ago, it returned by surprise to the Camera to emit its triumphant vote in the agreement of the debt ceiling.
In his first televising interview from the January shooting, that killed to six and hurt to 13, Giffords smiled, river and was sung - and described its recovery like “difficult”.
When Sawyer asked to him how she feels, Giffords, of 41 years, responded: “Rather well”.
The interview with Giffords and its husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of “20/20” of one hour of duration, that emitted the eve of the publication of the new book of the pair, “Gabby: A history of anger and hope”.
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords from the shooting of the 8 of January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, is seen it in its bed of hospital, with the shaved head and one long scar crossing its front.
She only can maintain one or two straight fingers, while his husband animates it.
Months later, it is seen Giffords seated in a wheelchair while the therapists teach to him how to conduct simple battles.
A head movement.
A fruncimiento of the lips.
And then, his first word: “What”.
In few days, Giffords pronounced another word - “toast”, a request of change in its menu of breakfast.
Videos spread by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: One sees the congresswoman singing along with the therapists the songs “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” of Cyndi Lauper and “Free Falling” of Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours ago of therapy every day, said that the day of the shooting does not remember.
His husband said that he was reading to Giffords an article to him of the periodic one on the murder of the 12 of March when she stopped it to ask for the first time about the six that had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is prisoner in a prison of Missouri and is being medicado by the force while he waits for judgment.
“Much people died”, said Giffords to him to Sawyer.
“, Hard, Hard hard.”
Kelly said to him to Sawyer who in a while of the recovery of her wife, she said: “I have been defeated.”
“So, I said to him,” “Gabby, you have not been defeated, “” said Kelly.
“You have only been struck.
And you are going to leave this, and are going to recover and you are going to return with more force than ever.”
The troops make feel more pity than respect
The event was a finery of Wall Street that collected million dollars for the veterans without home in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on the impotence, the frustration and the loss.
Then, several hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aviators and infants of navy burst in into their positions around him.
The label multitude put itself standing up and applauded.
“The men and women were considered like heroes”, said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring bottoms.
A military official of high rank in the finery, also known like then the president the Combined headquarters, admiral Mike Mullen, saw the paper of the troops differently.
“They showed Them like an as a child orphaned species”, wrote the official in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
That they had them.
But it was not respect, really. It was pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relation that has seized of the military and often distant an American public, sometimes, worshipper.
It is extended to the troops with praises by his sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public more and more acts as if they gave to pain those him uniformed.
“We are not victims absolutely”, said the brigadier general Are B. MacFarland, that commanded the troops in Iraq and soon it will start off for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way of which some show their support is to put to us in the paper of abandoned souls.”
The subject is a very sensible subject for the military leaders, who do not want to seem thankless or in discord with the public to whom they serve.
Also they realize which the wrath which the troops faced who in the last returned years of the war of Vietnam was much worse.
Like result, the majority of the conversations on the pity is carried out in deprived silence and in between the veterans military.
After their two children returned to fight with the Marines, distant colonel Mark Cancian noticed to them that people aside from the military would consider her service from two perspective.
Some would look to them with a fear feeling because they faced the insurgents and they traveled to exotic places.
Others would be wondered if there would be a “angry and violent veteran underneath the surface”, Cancian said, that it fought in Iraq and it returned to a work of high level of the government in Washington.
During his search of use, it said, it felt that some interviewers had asked to him subtly if he would be able to hold immediately under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington after its tour battle.
“When you speak about your service, you need to do in front of the negative impressions”, remembered Cancian counting it to its children.
The military restlessness arises, partly, of the American indifference towards the wars.
The profits in the battlefield rarely are chosen for the praise on the part of a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, like nation, no longer valued the military heroism of ways that were absolutely common in World War II”, David Barno said to the distant general lieutenant, who commanded the troops of EE.UU in Afghanistan.
However, the praises of the politicians and the public concentrate to a great extent in the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours that they have supported, the number of friendly that are lost or the reach of their injuries.
The army confronts an increasing pressure to end the violation
This week, an historical hearing will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army by their supposed passivity before the violation.
If no, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the following one.
The soldier of first Elizabeth Lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she says that she was violated by a companion.
It was October of 2008, and one went of return to its quarter in the Miramar Military airbase, to the north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when one was with a colleague who took a package of 12 tins of beer.
He asked to him if he could be united to her in his room to have a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal”, says Lyman.
Nevertheless, the native one of Texas left to a side its preoccupation.
I thought, no, has 19.
“It is of Texas”, it says.
“Hopefully it would have listened my instincts.”
The few minutes to enter the room of Lyman, the man approached to him behind, throwing it downwards and violating it, he alleges.
This week, the 18 of November, Lyman and other 27 present and old members of the military personnel anxiously wait for a judicial decision in an historical judgment that will be celebrated in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide if the demand which they have interposed against the exsecretario of Robert Gates Defense and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go in opinion.
The demand alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the violation generalized between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, D.C., the demand initially implied 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them affirm that they were violated or attacked sexually by his companions, and who the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or to distribute justice adapted after the supposed aggressions.
Burke says that she goes to by the flat major of the army, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a structure of above downwards”, it says.
“Who are the people who can to eradicate the culture of the retaliation? The High Command.”
Burke also says that from February, they have made contact with her near 400 survivors more, many of which could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating to all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in a same basket, so to speak, is going to present several cases, to be necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The equipment of the defense for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal public prosecutor Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to misestimate the case.
The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defense - in essence, that the military cannot be demanded by present or old soldiers by the injuries suffered in the Armed Forces.
By a sentence of the Supreme Court of 1950 call Doctrina Feres, the federal government is not responsible by the damages suffered by in good condition active personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs”, say the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to make commentaries for this article.
The things have changed from years 50.
Whereas to the women still officially it is prohibited to serve to them in combat, this distinction is only nominal: The modern wars rarely know clearly the lines of battle.
As much in Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of women welded are playing important roles more and more, especially to arrive at the local women in zones military.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women welded have died and two thirds of them in situations battle.
It is hour of which the army also is modernized, says Burke.
It is not single in its fight, and other three demands are in march, besides hers.
In the Faculty of Right of Yale, the Clinic of Legal Services for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military schools supposedly of promoting an antisocial atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army that concentrates in the diagnoses of “upheaval of the personality” assigned to the violation victims with the purpose of to give them to the discharge of the service - a common event, according to the activists, like Anu Bhagwati of the Network of Action of Women in good condition, a group of human rights.
Its group presented a demand in December against the Administration of Veterans, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the form in which it handles the claims of benefits for the people who say to be attacked sexually in the service.
Nine projects of law separately in the Congress on the part of a two-party mixture of senators and representatives have appeared, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 denounced sexual aggressions, according to the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual Aggression and Answer of the Department of Defense.
Nevertheless, the denounced aggressions are remarkably infra, and by the own estimations of the Pentagon, that it approximately bases in the 13.5 percent of the 19000 considered incidents that took place that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing indices: in 2010, a 20 percent of the cases denounced in the army went in opinion - half that in the system of civil justice.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, describe their attacks like only first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, it less than denounced the presumed violation to the military police one hour after it happened.
That night, says, was requested to him that it told to the details of his violation 11 times different from a multitude from police, doctors, and commanders.
It was put under a kit of violation, and the blood of its aggressor - of a cut in its arm she was found in its bed.
Six months later, in April of 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during who it was asked to him about which it had been sexual relations with his groom of the attack.
Six people declared like witnesses of personality in the name of the presumed author, who was finally acquitted.
“Memory the day in which the verdict was read”, says Lyman.
“I thought that it was going to me to go to the work - I was shouting from the room.”
“They put Me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, memory that I said line officers to him, "" That was not its judgment. That was my judgment”.
To Lyman it became ordained to him to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed an upheaval to him of the personality, which did it nonapt for the service.
In January of 2010 it was exempted from the service under less-that-honorable terms, which prevents him to receive any benefit.
As far as if the case presented by Lyman and its companions of demand it continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Right in the Faculty of George Washington Right.
Nevertheless, it indicates, “In my opinion, would have to be able to follow ahead”.
What one interposes among them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I have been a permanent critic of Doctrina Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and dissuasion that the responsibility raises.
And it adds: “The probabilities are strongly against them… but it is important them to try it.”
These things only change when good people are prepared to fight.
If the hearing does not go by its way, Burke, lawyer of the plaintiffs, will put to the tail to his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We are going to continue fighting against the army in this subject until the reform takes place”, it says.
“Or until we die, which happens first.
The walls have eyes: How the investigators are studying to you in Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type who aired his points of view in line anti-immigration.
Monday, Breivik, who it admitted to have realized a slaughter in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, faced his first public judicial hearing.
While Breivik only can have acted, it was far from being only in the cyberspace: It had happened most of the time that preceded to its attack in front of its computer, chatting with some of the million nationalists who support the groups of rights in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the investigators wanted to know more about these people.
But, how to find them?
Easy - you only must enter Facebook.
“We realized of which it was not so difficult to arrive at them”, Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently on European digital Populism by the British training center says WE GIVE.
The contraband of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the investigators could simply use the publicity tool to determine their demographic characteristics wished with a scientific precision - the way that the salesmen have been using during years.
The team of Bartlett found average million of fans of the groups of rights in all Europe and then they directed announcements to them, but instead of tying to a new band or product to them of diet, the announcements invited the users to complete a survey that asked on its educative level, attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on its own future.
When arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study to more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - everything without leaving the office.
“It is a totally new form to make an investigation”, says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not absolutely surprising: Those in favor in line of the groups of rights trend to being young, angry men and by immigration.
Nevertheless, in a species of turn, “those that in line combine their activism with the activism out of line are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those than they remain behind the screen of the computer”.
The work of WE GIVE is only an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool into the hands of the scientists.
Medical investigator, research centers and scientific politicians are using the site to study everything, from problems of health to social tendencies as I express myself in “likes”, messages in the walls and updates of state.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content to the day, the “supernova of data” of Facebook is generating a height of the investigation, impelling the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title until almost a 800% in the last five years.
For some investigators, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people whom you could not approach to you with a folder in the street.
“Before, when you tried survey to people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to go through party, and they never would allow the access you”, says Bartlett.
“Facebook eliminates all that - you go directly to them.”
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and to approach the problems of health-social.
A recent study realised by doctor Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that the university students that they spoke of his feats of drunkenness in Facebook had a significantly greater risk to have problems with the drink that the students who remained in silence on the subject.
Colored person suggests them companions of the students, such as the residential advisers, could control the site and take part to help a student who publishes too many updates of state with his drunkennesses.
“You cannot tackle a problem if you cannot diagnose it”, Dimitri Christakis said, the Co-author of Colored person and director of the Center of Health, Behavior and Development of the Boy in the Institute of Infantile Investigation of Seattle, said Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify children in risk who otherwise would not be diagnosed.”
Facebook also is constantly “puncturing” its own population to collect data.
The Equipment of Data of the site has elaborated statistical on the state of the relation and the Day of San Valentin, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and an index of National Happiness (mainly using the information to which it is possible to be acceded long ago - defending of the digital freedom which they maintain that the site would have to put at the disposal of another its great amount of data for the investigation).
Nevertheless, the users of Facebook they know that the site is watching them, likes or not - the sacrifice to be able to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometers of distance is to allow that the site mines your personal information.
Pero what happens when the users of Facebook happen to comprise of a survey who not even know?
Whereas the investigators have directives good defined envelope how to pick up their data out of line, in line it is a free bar for all.
“I do not believe that many of the users have at least thought about the fact that an investigator could be examining his profiles”, Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London says, on a 2006 study that carried out with the walls public of Facebook of students.
“In which to them it concerned, it was only among them and its friendly.”
Soon it is the question of the methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee of which an investigation subject this being completely honest.
In Facebook, it is impossible to know that it leaves from the information of the profile of a user and of the messages of the wall they are truth.
“What you say in Facebook and what beams outside Facebook are two completely different things”, says Selwyn.
It is why, in spite of its years like investigator of the technology, Selwyn thinks that a paper clip and a ball-point pen continue being the best tools of investigation than nobody can use.
“There is substitute no to enter the real world and to speak with real people”, it says.
“The social investigation assumes that it is on the social thing - and a pile of the social thing still happens out of line.”
“Cold and cruel: Anders Behring Breivik does his first public appearance in the court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of both attacks that killed to 77 people in Norway this summer, has described to itself like a combatant of the “resistance” during his first public appearance in the court of Oslo.
“I am a military commandant in the Norwegian movement of resistance and the Templarios Horsemen of Norway”, it said before a full room with 500 people.
“I am against to the court, since it received the mandate of the organizations who support the ideology of hatred and because it supports the multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the facts but I do not declare culprit.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted to Breivik during that monolog, because “she did not want to give to Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing like a platform so that she expresses his points of view”.
For the same reason one refused to allow Breivik, that brought a speech written in advance, to go to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered to the police to maintain more to Breivik under safekeeping during 12 weeks, it prohibited the access him to mass media during four weeks, and said that the authorities must have a strict control on all the visits and the correspondence during eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims they attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope to look at Breivik at the eyes, others to confirm that it is shut under key.
All attended with the aim of advancing towards the conclusion.
“I thought that it seemed cold and cruel”, Norwegian NRK said to a survivor of Utoya to the transmitter.
“He was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dress with a dark suit and blue necktie, Breivik stayed calmed and professional throughout the hearing and looked at the journalists and the survivors to the eyes when it entered and it left the building.
In spite of the strange notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of “greater resistance”, the judge determined that he is not a mental patient, and said that there are no tests that she acted with accomplices.
It is possible that to some it consoles to them that the attacks of the 22 of July seem to be work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that automatically does not smooth out to the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feels.
“I would like that it seemed a monster, but it does not seem”, said it a relative of a victim.
“It would be much more easy if it seemed it.”
7 Lessons of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, are in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, the 5 of October, were some compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing to the genius of the technology like the Great Modern Inventor.
But what fans of Apple could find more revealer, in an interview to Jobs recently rediscovered to which advance of a series of special projections in the majors has been dusted as markets this week, it is how much it understood this creative mind about the commercial processes and job streams of products.
He was without a doubt autorreconocido a designer, dreamy and hippie, but also he was a meticulous organizer and yonki of the flow charts - a man who thought that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is the 90 percent of the work… [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing to the series of television The Triumph of the Nerds (the triumph of the idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and she sat down for more than one hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
Then they had spent barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and already worked intensely in its new computer science company NeXT, hoping the popular adoption of Internet.
Whereas a small part of the interview of Cringely was used in Nerds, it said that the original ones of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs that was discovered a complete copy in VHS in the garage of the director.
This material of file, slightly reedited, is the base of Steve Jobs: The lost interview, of 68 minutes, that arrive at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For somebody well-known to hate the interviews in depth, Jobs seems surprising arranged here to set out its technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is hefting clearly its thoughts, looking for precision.
Also there are moments at which the perfectionism of Jobs leaves to the surface, where it seems impatient due to the questions of Cringely, pushing to him to go more express towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in the lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what sees that other companies do well and badly, and offers its own vision of the future of computer science.
A thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the race of Jobs, but there is something crude and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, dreamy anxious on the brink of madness the greatness.
It has a vision of how they can and they must be the things.
Not much after explaining it everything in detail here, it was and it did it.
A fast summary of seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
On how it learned to take a business:
“Throughout the years in the business, I always asked: ""For which beams things” and the answers that they give you of invariable form are: “Oh, that is only the way since it becomes”.
Nobody knows why it does what does, in the businesses nobody thinks very deeply about the things.
That is what I found.
Jobs takes retail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple.
Disturbed by the form in the costs were registered - often beginning with a “standard cost” that was made by guesswork, and that soon it adjusted with a “variable” - developed an automated factory that assured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the “Blue Box” that he himself constructed with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hackear the telephone company effectively and to make calls long-distance free.
It has been written widely about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the Blue Box as a empoderamiento act is contagious.
It describes how it and Wozniak proved the box by means of the use of a public telephone, making a call, and soon connecting itself from a network from AT&amp\;T to another one, while he created a curl with the greater possible amount of satellites.
“We were surrounding the things around the world an average dozen of times and you shouted through public telephone and returned a minute later to the public telephone of the door from alongside”, says Jobs with a giggle.
“Éramos young and what we learned was that we could construct to something we ourself who could anywhere in the world control thousands of million dollars in infrastructure.”
We two, did not know much, but we could construct a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that never Apple without her had existed.
Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost leave, calling to the Vatican through the Blue Box in half at night and soliciing to speak with the Pope, while it made his better imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the catholic hierarchy were summoned in half at night to speak with the American diplomat, both they exploded in outbursts of laughter right before the very same Pope was waked up to go to answer the telephone.
On falling in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, the hunting of pieces of spare part to construct a frequency counter, it looked for Bill Hewlett in the phonebook and it did a call to him.
Shortly after its telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs part-time obtained an employment of summer in Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had seen that age and formed my vision than was a company and the good that their employees treated.”
Jobs later became one of the employees of HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where fact never saw “the first table computer”.
It was as great as a suitcase, it had a small screen of cathodic tube, and I fell in love with him.
It would secure an adolescent trip until HP as and would waste the time with that machine and would write programs for her.
On improvising the innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his race, since she dedicated herself to sell a handful of motherboards, a client asked to him if she could mount all the equipment.
Working just by 30 days of credit, it had to find out the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while it was in Apple, it remembers the fights which one faced in the development of a computer mouse:
“I decide to Me to have dramatic arguments… shouted to me that they would be needed five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I was satiated to me and I was myself outside and I found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could construct by 15 dollars and that were totally trustworthy.
On the great companies losing force:
Long before which it led the Renaissance of Apple, prophetically previous Jobs the form over which many leaders of the industry would encounter in their vision, and would lose the control of their market share.
“I gave that you work in IBM or Xerox, reason why beams better photocopiers and printers, and what”
You have the monopoly of the market share, reason why the company is not more successful.
The departments of sales and marketing increase the success, reason why those are this class of people that finish managing the companies and the people in charge of products are expelled from the forum for the decision making.
The genius of the products that took to that position of monopoly rots because of people who do not have the product notion good versus bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That is what happened in Xerox…
Xerox could have appropriated all the computer industry.
Its size could have been ten times, could have been the Microsoft of years 90…
They took the defeat from the victory.
On the innovation like artistic expression:
“There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product… as the great idea evolves, it changes and it grows.”
Much is learned about the subtilities of the same.
There are sacrifices that you must do - some things that you cannot cause that they make electrons, the glass does, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You must maintain 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - to fit them all simultaneously…
In the end everything is reduced to the taste - it stoops to try to expose to you that a team of humans has done, and soon to perhaps try to adapt those things to which your you are doing.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, the great artists rob.
We have never been ashamed about robbing great ideas.
What partly she did great to Macintosh was that the people who were working in him were musical, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were accidentally the best computer science scientists of the world.
If not outside of computer science, it could be in favor making wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the rivals of the law of medical assistance while the court accepts the case
The day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the question politically controverted if they would accept the challenge to the law of medical assistance of president Obama, two of their magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were entertained in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will set out the case before the high court.
The occasion was the past Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study revision requests meticulously.
One of the cases at issue was a demand presented by 26 states defying the total reform of the medical assistance approved by the Congress the last year, a law that has been a shout military for the preservative activists in all the country.
The magistrates decided to admit to proceeding the demand and, in fact, an historical plea of 5 hour and a half for March is expected, and the result probably will cloud still more the presidential race of 2012, that will be in the heat of apogee at the moment in which the decision of the court is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will allege that the law must be rejected will be probably Paul Clement, who served like general prosecutor of EE.UU during the government of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost the two dozens of companies that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Society Federalist, a group that has been many years dedicated to the defense of the preservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., that has an enormous financial interest in the result of the litigation.
Dinner was celebrated in a hotel of Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
Between the assistants it was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the law of medical assistance.
The special guests in dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
He is not nothing new: Both judges have been attending events of the Society Federalist during years.
And he is not something that enters conflict with the ethical norms.
In fact, the judges are exempt of the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the federal magistrates inferiors.
If they were not it, it could say that they would fall under the Canon Code 4C, that says: “A judge can attend events to collect bottoms of organizations related to the law and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear in the program of such event. ”
Nevertheless, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the writing desks of lawyers in the case, as well as to a company with an enormous financial interest, it was sufficient to alarm to the activists of ethics in the government.
“This impressive breach of the ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several magistrates whom the court by the same rules accepts that are applied to all the federal judges”, Bob Edgar said, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
“The judges were entertained in a collection of bottoms in full dress with lawyers who have pending cases before the court.”
Its appearance and attendance in the collection of bottoms for this event undermine any demand of impartiality, and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by the critics that say that they too much easily mix the activity of the court with the agenda driven by groups like the Society Federalist.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is an outstanding preservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives argue that it is judge Elena Kagan, the one that has an ethical problem, nonScalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked like Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance appeared.
Their critics have pressed so that Kagan abstains to see the case, saying that too much he was involved in defending the law like now being impartial.
Kagan has not given any instructions of which it is going it to do.
Boeing receives an order record of 18 billions of dollars
The Emirates airline requests 50 airplanes of double corridor Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six airplanes Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, an operation valued in more than billions of dollars.
Rarely it is the news when a company obtains an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a great transaction when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. airplanes and the sale price for the 50 airplanes ascends to a record of 18 billions of dollars.
It is as great as the place from where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, a gold mine in growth of requested futures of airplanes.
In a given study to know Monday, the company of Chicago esteem that during next the 20 years the airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 airplanes by value 450 billions dollars.
Boeing announced during the weekend its greater order of history for commercial airplanes by its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 of double corridor.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubái.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 airplanes more, which would lift the total sale price to 26 billions of dollars, Boeing in the Aeronautical Hall Dubái 2011 announced.
Then, Monday, Boeing said that six Oman Air had requested Boeing 787-8s, the Dreamliner call, that presumes of a saving of fuel and some services for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six of them is more than billions of dollars.
“This knows clearly an enormous positive effect for Boeing”, said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
“The quality of these clients in particular is very strong.”
Many airlines of the Middle East are property of their petroleum producer nations.
Therefore, not only they have the money to pay the airplanes, but an increase in the prices of the fuel - generally detrimental for the air lines, because he is one of the majors costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the increase of the price of petroleum.
That is important because they have less probabilities than other airlines to cancel or to delay the aircraft formations when the prices of the fuel increase, said Dihora.
“They have a natural protection”, it said.
The order of the Emirates solidifies to the leadership of Boeing in the market of airplanes of wide fuselage and aid to maintain to ray the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its dominion with the passenger airplane A350.
The victory of Boeing in the fair of the air takes place four months after Airbus said that it was going to delay the debut of the greatest A350, than competes directly with 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more impulse after the clients demanded an increase of the payload and the rank.
The actions of Boeing Co raised a 1.5% up to 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the voting of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderón affirms that the narcotics traffickers helped their opponent of the PRI, the Faustus Vallejo, in the fight for governor.
The sister of president Felipe Calderón seems to have lost her candidacy to governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she affirmed Monday that the narcotics traffickers helped to incline the race in favor of one of their opponents.
The preliminary results gave the advantage in the race for governor of the western state to the Faustus Vallejo, of Institutional the Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of the organized crime throughout the electoral process and, mainly yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for all the country”, said to Luisa Maria Calderón in a radio interview a day after the voting of Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, to our electoral workers… They seized of the ballot boxes, they installed barricades… and they ordered to the people who voted” in favor of the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico during seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
Nevertheless, it is the putting in scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has the hope to gain the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed nearly margin to Calderón, that had led the surveys before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate of the Divided conservative of National Action of its brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo like the winner.
Silvano You aureole, the candidate of lefts by the Party Democratic Revolution, or PRD, that at the moment holds the governor position, was thirdly, a great defeat for the left divided and unfortunate before the presidential elections of 2012.
You also aureole refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalcalde of the State Capital of Morelia, denied bonds with the drug trafficking and insisted to the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been during long time dominated by specialized cartels of the drug in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of president Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to send a directed military offensive against the dealers in December of 2006.
Nevertheless the violence has persisted.
A mayor of the PAN was assassinated one week before the elections while he campaigned by Luisa Maria Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidacies by fear.
Although for the PRI, by disagreeable that seems the elections of Michoacán, a victory will help to impel the party.
The man who assumes will represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Rock Grandson, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: “I believe that this victory would have to be very encouraging, facing the next year”.
The BAsD insists to Asia to help to rescue to the eurozone
The Asian Bank of Development (BAsD) has made a call to India and China so that they are prepared to help to rescue to the eurozone of his crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long term recession that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, general director of the Asian Bank of Development with headquarters in Manila, said that the two great economies of faster growth of the world had “to do all the possible one” to outside accelerate the recovery of the economic block or through International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
It noticed against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe of “an impartial” way and said that the financial attendance of Asia along with the leadership and European resources would help to avoid a long term crisis in the global economy.
“We are all together ones in this.”
“So whatever can help to Europe to leave the crisis is useful”, it said within the framework to Financial Times in an interview of World-wide the Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can to a certain extent be protected, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, that are at all costs.”
The European monetary union has been seen seriously undermined by a crisis of sovereign debt in the last months.
In the last days, the costs of indebtedness of Italy have gone off dangerously and prime minister of Italy and Greece has resigned.
The present crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears of which it could push the global economy to the recession and has generated calls so that the main emergent economies are united to help to the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support of Asia would be canalized through the IMF, but said that the bilateral attendance - as the purchase of bonds of the bottom of rescue of the EU, the European Bottom of financial stability - a greater power to negotiate for the Asian partners of Europe offered.
Anand Sharma, Indian minister of Commerce, said that “India is going to do all the possible one” to help to the eurozone since its own economy now was undergoing the fall of exports and the exhaustion of the entrances of foreign capital.
“Nobody wants that the eurozone continues being unstable and turbulent”, it said.
“We have monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
“It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where we found use for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that the developing economies as India does not have responsibility in helping European the rich ones when they face his own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of the University of Brown in the EE.UU., said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people of the India, on which up to 800 million they live with near 2 dollars to the day or less.
“At some time they will realize of which the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and they go away of vacations to beaches and that will not fall well”, it said.
Lee Howell, managing director of World-wide the Economic Forum, also was wondered why the reserves of India were due to use to maintain to the numerous ones and remunerated workers of the Greek public sector well, in jobs of companies badly administered, and generating of losses like the railroads.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis of the eurozone threatens “important effects in chain” by all Asia.
The prognosis of the Asian Bank of Development of the 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 faces the “risks to the loss” due to the threat of Europe now.
It said that the vulnerable emergent markets needed to formulate “plans of contingency” to protect of a crisis and significant exits of capital of their economies.
Serious warnings of the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
The Leon, Secretary of Defense Panetta, warmed up the Congress Monday, warning that the automatic cuts of budget that are approached could undermine the national security and bring about a financial reaction in chain from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civil production lines.
The Pentagon or is digesting 450 billions of dollars of reductions throughout the next decade, but now it fears a farther reduction of 600 billions or the more in cuts that can be imminent if the Congress is not able to reach an agreement on the cost.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department”, said Panetta in a letter to senators John McCain, republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, republican by Carolina of the South.
It said that the failure of the Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the call “kidnapping”, they would call to place to a 23 percent of global reductions and to many new projects.
“A so great cut, applied this way indiscriminate, would cause that most of our naval projects and of construction cannot be executed - cannot be bought three quarters of a boat or a building - and be damaged other efforts of modernization seriously”, Panetta to the senators wrote.
“Also we would be forced to separate unvoluntarily to many from our civil civil servants and, because the reduction would prevail with as much rapidity, it is almost certainly we would have to license civilians with the purpose of to fulfill the objective.”
“These changes would break the faith with which maintains our army and would damage the good disposition seriously.”
The cuts with time would reach to the troops battle, said Panetta.
“Although the financing for times military in the accounts of Operations of contingency overseas is not seen directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be affected negatively by the serious upheavals in the basic budgets”, warned Panetta.
“The personnel hiring would be reduced, which would take to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war.”
“The personnel in list would be reduced, giving rise to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time military, and the legal and political support would be interrupted.”
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would bring about a fast declivity of the United States like main military power of the world.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action”, said afternoon the senators in a joint communique of Monday when they published the letter of Panetta.
“This it is not a result with which it is possible to be lived, and certainly he is not one that we must prevail same.”
“The kidnapping is a threat for the interests of the national security of the United States, and it is not due to allow that it happens.”
If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify the calls to exempt to the Pentagon of cuts are about to see.
Panetta has been more and more frank on possible cuts, although it arrived at a work in the top from the Pentagon with years from experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that it faced difficult decisions.
In a press conference the last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a shady panorama than he could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
“It is a boat without sailors.”
“It is a brigade without bullets.”
“It is an air wing without sufficient trained pilots.”
“It is a paper tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and pumps without sufficient enabled soldiers accomplish a mission”, said Panetta in its words of opening in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that undergoes the low moral, the deficient preparation and is not able to stay to the day with the opposing potentials.”
“Indeed, it invites to the aggression…”
In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciates new details of how the reductions “generate important operative risks: it delays in the response time to the crises, conflicts and disasters\; it severely limits our capacity to be unfolded and it jeopardize previously anywhere in the world\; and it supposes an unacceptable risk in future operations battle.”
And Panetta said that some of the majors defense projects could confront the axe, including which already are trying on and some only in the first stages of the planning.
This list includes the airplane battle F35 Joint Fighter Strike, a new bomber the anticipated, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new coastal boat battle and new earth vehicle battle that the Army and Navy need to replace, humvee.
To stop the development and the additional tests of the F35 could generate about 80 billions of dollars in savings throughout 10 years, but their those in favor say that it is the following vital step to improve and to confront the potential threats of China and other rivals.
Like detecting a lie
A look to the most recent holders indicates to us how serious and omnipresent they are the deceit and the lie in the daily life.
The presidential candidate republican Herman Cain is occupied interchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women\; each part accuses to lie to the other.
The administrators of the Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury supposedly to hide information that said that a trainer of distant soccer was sexually attacking children.
The last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, “was pillaged” with an open microphone affirming to the president of EE.UU., Barack Obama, who Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a lying one.
To lie has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
The congressman by New York and exhibitionist in Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous situation with his denial quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
The ex- presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in the financing of the campaign related to the concealment of a maritally relation.
And, again, nobody that lived it will never forget the mediatic circus untied by president Bill Clinton when lying during its second mandate about its sexual relation with Mónica Lewinsky.
Very the legend on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university is extended.
Cases have occurred in which the professors have given to the answers of the examinations to the students with the purpose of to be better sights in their evaluations of yield.
Mentors who would have to be teaching the opposite are sending the message of which to lie and to deceive are acceptable.
How much deceit we were?
In a day anyone, the studies show that they can lie to you in any place of 10 to 200 times.
That insurance, many of those lies are noble lies.
Another study showed that the strangers lay three times in the first 10 minutes to know themselves.
To detect lies, or “the location of lies”, it is an essential ability that we must acquire all, for personal reasons as as much professional.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charade, where the objective is to exclaim: “I have to You”, the detection of the deceit is a branch of the serious knowledge based on obtained scientific datas during last the six decades in prestigious universities that realized investigation projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
The lying ones yes look at the eyes.
Not always they stutter, they stammer, they are blushed or they troubled.
It is not possible to be concluded either that the lying ones are difficult to detect or to unmask.
A detector of lies trained can arrive at the truth learning about the structure from the declaration, the microface expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I passed several years drilling the scientific discoveries over the deceit in the vast and always emergent body of the knowledge, and was clear that the detection of the deceit is a modern technology that is easy to learn and aid to sail especially by our complex world - if their professional responsibilities include the hiring, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
Good the lying ones have the ability to read well to the others, making them feel to taste, handling their own emotions and feeling of intuitive form how the others perceive them.
We know by the investigations that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, who the men say more “lies oriented towards themselves”, whereas the women say more oriented lies “towards the others” -- normally to protect the feelings of somebody -- that the married people less frequently lie to their pairs that the people who are not married (but the lies that usually say trend to being “enormous”).
Also we know that if you are perceived like a malefactor, the others will feel like less guilty when lying to him.
How to know if somebody is lying?
First, it observes the habitual conduct of the subject.
This is called “to create a basic line”.
Aid to provide datum points to measure the changes later.
It observes the position of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It is better than it knows if somebody normally taps with the foot all along not to make unjust accusations when it sees the feet him tapping in half of the meeting.
Next, it looks for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal groups of behavior.
It considers to these groups of behavior like alarm signals, not as test of deceit.
The people who deceive can freeze the part superior of the body when trying to remember their history, can point their feet towards the door, incline towards an exit, change their position significantly or to exhibit a “relief postinterviews” -- that exaggerated sigh of lightening and change of position once all the difficult questions have finished.
Often the interrogators make see falsely that the interview has finished to only look for that lightening postinterviews.
Also it pays attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson put the leg until the bottom and used the past time while she affirmed that her assassinated wife was alive, sending a search of her to national level.
The people who also deceive can use a language jackstay: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman… the Lewinsky young lady” or to repeat a difficult question completely.
The more common verbal indicators are subtle.
Somebody can use a pile of “restrictive language” when it answers a difficult question: “Good… to tell the truth… until which I… in my opinion.”
This causes that the answer is a perception instead of a fact and is often an alert signal.
There is no magical formula to detect lies, but to develop abilities to discover the deceit is possible.
These abilities will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid to be victimizados by the artists of the swindle in their professional and personal lives.
The controverted plan of the pipe line turned aside after the threat of the delay of EE.UU in its approval
Days after the administration of Obama threatened delaying the approval of a pipe line planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating the unions, while it calmed the ecologists -- the company that it looks for to construct the pipe line says that it is arranged to redirigir the project to return to direct it.
TransCanada said Monday at night that it will move the pipe line planned outside the ecologically sensible area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will gain the approval.
The company announced the decision in the press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The manager of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence in that with time the pipe line is approved, although it is certain that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement the week last on the part of the Department of State of which they would delay the decision by a federal permission for the project until new potential routes study that avoid the areas of Sandhills de Nebraska and the water-bearing Ogallala, a vast underground water provision.
“This is a true one via of progress”, said the representative Lee Terry, republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental revision ordinate by the Department of S-state possible that separate any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the civil servants denied that the policy was surrounded in the decision.
Obama, in a written declaration the last week, described the decision like the request of the Department of State, and he expressed all their support to them.
The pipe line, of 1,700 kilometers would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day of the province from Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For it, it would be necessary that it crossed six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the work groups, that have bet by the estimation of 20,000 tie jobs to the pipe line.
But the opposed legislators of Nebraska to the plan are hefting the legislation to force a distance of the region of Sandhills and the water-bearing Ogallala, the greater source of potable water and irrigation.
The study of present environmental impact of the Department of State found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the industry energetics said that the chief inspector of the department has ordered an independent test of the revision process, concentrating in two questions.
One is if the member of the lobby contracted by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was adviser of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interests for the program.
The other is if one signature that was contracted to direct the original study were an unsuitable election because she was tie to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle demanded supposedly to cause that a boy vomited of fear
A family of New York affirms that the diva of music disc, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy person in the lobby of her building of Manhattan, terrifying to her small daughter until the point of which she vomited of fear.
The tirade of the singer of “Marmalade Lady” scared Genevieve Monk, of 18 months of age, as much that it underwent “changes of personality, upheavals of the dream” and “it increased its fear to the strangers”, says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
He was the 10 of November of the past year when the schemer Kevin Monk, its wife, Roseanna, professor of kindergarten, and Genevieve was preparing himself to go to a familiar trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk lowered to the lobby of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with its luggage, taking to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said that it was stopped near the door and put for a moment to its daughter in the ground.
“Somebody approached behind and it said to me,” You know what your daughter is doing? “I said to Him “yes” and I went to take it”, it said.
LaBelle admonished angry the pregnant woman.
“It said in an aggressive tone, “must not have left to his daughter near the door”, said Roseanna Monk.
“I said to Him, “I do not have any interest in which you say or think”.
One became infuriated and it began to use bad words aloud - word C and word J…
It had a water bottle and it began to throw the water of the bottle on me.”
He said that Genevieve put himself hysterical.
“I said to Him to this woman, “Sight which you have made him daughter”, the mother of the girl said.
LaBelle was rushed on the mother -- that still it held to Genevieve -- and it had to be contained by his surroundings and retired to an automobile that waited for it, it said Roseanna Monk.
The small one was crying so strong that it vomited, added.
Later, the family sent a note asking an excuse of LaBelle, but she did not obtain answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not give back the calls to comment the happened thing.
The demand looks for damages nonspecified, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case and that free the family glides to donate all the money that obtains to an association of support to the children with cancer.
“The intention is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct”, said Davis.
“That type of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when he goes to a teacher of kindergarten that takes in arms to a boy of 18 months of age.”
Climatic adversity restrained the economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa it has increased unemployment and the unmannerliness, lowered the foreign investment and the economy was contracted
The 2011 are a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, is the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, call oneself of the change, that generated great expectations with respect to the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of beginning of year, is not observed growth, however yes a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development is registered.
The low temperatures of February, besides inflict casualtieses to millionaires for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, generally caused a contraction of the economic activity of 3,6 percent in the first semester of the year, justified mainly by the historical fall of 31,16 percent in the agriculture, that affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of affectations by the frosts, emitted by the Mexican Council for the Viable Rural Development, damages in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated were had, of which the 78,03 percent suffered total damage and the rest 21,07 percent had partial damage, the main ill-fated cultures were those of vegetables, maize and chick-pea.
The fall in the economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase of unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistic and Geography the rate of state leisure during the three first trimesters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while of January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloenses were vacated, with a rate of 4,53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second trimester the rate happened to be 5,28 percent, and between July and September the average continued being increased up to 6,19 percent, a rate that in number of people throw to more than 74 thousand unemployed sinaloenses, an increase with respect to the first one semester of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Smaller liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multi-factor, for the economist Gerald Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of leisure can be explained indirectly, based on the actions that from the public policy have been realized.
“What one is seeing is a growth of the unemployment that it has to do with several factors, among them the loss of liquidity in the market by effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in the congress to fight the money laundering already, for the people who take hold dollars of illicit way is not easy to him that it works them, it invests them and it uses them in something”, it expressed.
Lengthy migration
Lopez Cervantes indicated that in the increase in unemployment a demographic factor also exists.
“The number of people that goes away abroad of the state in search of work, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter secondly, and because entering already they also have many difficulties to find a job, that people are remaining and demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes that unemployment rises”, declared.
Unmannerliness
The analysis of the sinaloense labor market worsens when considering the high level of unmannerliness that predominates between the conditions of work, according to the INEGI, 60,38 percent of the population occupied in the state works without being quoting like worker before no institution of social security.
Combined to unemployment and unmannerliness, another one of the labor remaindered good of the S-state the low wages, the organization has the lowest remunerations of the Country, according to the registries of the Mexican Institute of the Social Insurance and the Secretariat of the Work and Social Forecast.
The monthly entrance average of the sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, very below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Combined to the increase and downturn in the economy in unemployment, during 2011 the greater diminution of the Direct Foreign Investment of last the 10 years is registered, according to the Secretariat of Economy of January to June of the state IED added 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87,74 percent with respect to 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
On the other hand, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the state Government mainly enters a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million weights in the year, happened of companies of the tertiary sector.
The debt
Before the scene of economic contraction, the Government of the state asked for in July to the state congress the approval of a credit by 3 billions of pesos, same that would be destined the investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was by an amount of 2 thousand 600 million weights, and until November they have not observed the benefits of the indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the enterprise sector, the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Buckets gives sample of a lack of capacity of management of the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Camera of the Industry of the Transformation, expressed that during 2011 he lacked himself the harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the own Government of the state.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, is necessary to work intensely to reclaim the land that we lost in this year, in the 2012 we must redouble efforts, lacked to align the effort of all mainly and the good already synchronous march of this new team of Government, we hoped that the next year is far better”, it expressed.
Economic slowness
Loredo Lopez indicated that events as the frosts of year principles stopped the state economy and restricted their performance and growth.
“Under economic flow it is product of several events, among them the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not give fast return sufficiently to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing very below the expectations that we had”, it mentioned.
To redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, showed that he requires himself to prosecute to the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that are had been working, we think that it is necessary to develop a program of long term in which redefines the vocation and the economic course of the state, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource is detonated that has Sinaloa”, said.
Work to do
The president of the Coparmex emphasized the importance de futuro of settling down a vision that channels better the efforts of the Government.
“In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in the matter of economic development are some advances but it is important that a long term program is developed”, declared.
It indicated that the present administration has shown advances in its form to lead the public policy.
“There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more including, I what I can say am that there is work done and I believe that the Government is conscious that there is work to do”, expressed.
They condemn it by 8 kgs of marijuana
To five years of prison and 100 days of fine a neighbor of Navolato by the possession of eight kilos of marijuana was sentenced.
The General Office of the judge advocate general of the Republic informed that the sentenced narcomenudista is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, by the crime into against the health, in its variant of possession of marijuana with commerce aims.

It must contributions for works
The contemplated works of social character in programs like Habitat, Rescue of Spaces Public and 3x1 for migrant are in risk of not being concluded or to have serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, it indicated to Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although until now the work programs have advanced, yes they are in risk to not to have fulfilled the Government of the State with the contributions that correspond to him who add a resource superior to the 11 million weights in the three programs.
It indicated that altogether the investment in these three programs is of almost 50 million weights, of which to the State the 25 percent corresponds and that until now the Federation and the Municipality have only contributed resources for works, reason why the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
“They are almost 12 million which is called on to contribute to them and although the year is about to finish have not given us nor fifth, when from July they had to report to us”, it expressed, “we not to delay to us we have initiated works and go outposts, but us very it is necessary the money”.
It mentioned that the last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not fulfill the contributions that corresponded to them, reason why at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to ask for a credit to cover but with 7 million that the state administration did not contribute in that one occasion.
“It already passed in the previous presidential term because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued walking, and this year we for being able to accede to these programs had to secure the resources to cover what left to slope the State”, detailed.
Although the commitment of the state authorities exists to fulfill the delivery of these resources, it commented that the request to the Secretary has become of Administration and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to hurry the managements so that the percentage that correspond to them arrive as rapidly as possible.
“They are almost 12 million which is called on to contribute to them and although the year is about to finish not they have given us nor fifth”.
It cuts valued “analogical blackout” in Mexico in the 2015
The substitution of analog signals by digitalises is one of the most important changes that it has undergone the world in the last years
The Supreme Court of Law of the Nation (SCJN) misestimated the constitutional controversies that interposed the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that advances to the call “analogical blackout” from 2021 to 2015, when not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that president Felipe Calderón did not exceed in his attributions when emitting the decree that details the actions to follow to make specific the transition to the terrestrial digital television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was misestimated not to reach the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court pronounced on the consitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is effective.
The project of sentence, elaborated by minister Olga Sanchez Lamb, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of the matters of radio and television is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in disobedience of the principles of hierarchic subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project they only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Brown Mario, Daisy Moon and own Sanchez Lamb.
With this argument, as much the Senate as the House of Representatives promoted two constitutional controversies to oppose the decree, and when admitting the demands, minister Sanchez Lamb suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in him arranged to the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers solved to also reject the demand interposed by the House of Representatives, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of minister Sanchez Lamb.
In his intervention, the minister president said not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general norms the measures so that the public administration prepares itself.
“I do not consider Either that if did it would be affected the autonomy of the regulating organ”, and remembered that the planning of public policies in strategic areas as the sector of telecommunications corresponds to the federal Executive, whom it has by constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The substitution of analog signals by digitalises is one of the most important changes that it has undergone the world in the last years, and it is translated in a better advantage of the radioelectric phantom, one better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, maintained, would be to delay the benefits of the digitalization, that implies a decision of public interest, that does not only have a technical dimension, “because it includes economic issues, social, political and of national security”.
These questions, emphasized, “demand the operation of all the established system, according to the principle of economic rectory of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the state Executive”.
It remembered that a great number of countries anywhere in the world has concluded already the digital transition, and has done it through Executive, in spite of counting on technical organs highly specialized.
It is not possible to be concluded that the Executive, when emitting the opposed decree, that invades in some form the sphere of competitions of the Congress, because the observance of the laws emitted by the Legislative one is being provided in the administrative sphere, assured.
They analyze possibility of a count “vote by vote” in Michoacán
In agreement with the data thrown by the PREP the difference enters first and secondly place of the election of governor is of hardly 27 percent, still without entering the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 thousand 74 total acts.
The possibility of the count “vote by vote” is a reality concerning the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where in agreement with the data thrown by the Program of Preliminary Election results (PREP) the difference enters first and secondly place of the election of governor is of hardly 27 percent, still without entering the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 thousand 74 total acts.
On the matter, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Maria of Los Angeles Llanderal Saragossa, remembered that some ago days, as soon as the past 9 of November, the electoral organ approved a series of lineaments with the purpose of to harmonize the local norms with the federal reform in electoral matter.
As one remembers, Michoacán did not accredit its Political Constitution nor its Electoral Code of the State or its Law of Electoral Justice, every time the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before concluding the legal term so that they could enter the present electoral process in force and governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication in the terms anticipated in the Law of the Official Newspaper of the State, with the argument of which had some objections.
The same 9 of November, the Supreme Court of Law of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative power and described as “invalid and illegal” the vote as the state agent chief executive to the constitutional reforms, every time it does not have right “to sanction them or to veto them”.
Interviewed person around the possibility of the “vote by vote”, Maria of Los Angeles Llanderal exposed that thanks to the approval of the corresponding lineaments on the part of the General Council of the IEM the accomplishment of partial and total counts of the voting on the part of the local electoral organ will be possible.
Of that form, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be able to occur in the assumptions that: the results of acts do not agree\; the scrutiny act does not exist and calculation in the file of the square or does not build in the power of the president of the same\; or, when errors or evident alterations of acts exist.
In addition, the total count of the voting received in all the squares of the election will be able to be realized when indication that exists the difference between the winning presumed candidate of in question election and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting, is equal or smaller to a percentage point\; as long as at the beginning of the session the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition exists that it postulated to the second of the indicated candidates.
The total count of the voting also will be able to be realized S.A. to finish the ordinary calculation settles down that the difference between the presumably winning candidate and the located one secondly is equal or smaller to a percentage point, as long as exists the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was secondly, case in which the electoral packages will be excluded that have been object of partial count.
It is possible to mention that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where in agreement with the PREP the difference between first and the second place is of as soon as the 0,16 percent, although without entering the votes of 129 of 923 total acts.
Its last will
Their ashes will be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The rest of pilot Courteous Empty Felipe arrived at Forecastle, its hometown, this Sunday at night, during Monday recognitions and a mass of requiem took to end.
According to its relatives the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that their ashes were scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute the side of the other people passed away in the accident, the family of Courteous Emptiness returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an airship of the Mexican Air Force, the people more close friends attended the ceremony in the Mars Field.

The new Italian government will form Wednesday
Designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government who will face a crisis that has placed to that country on the brink of madness the economic disaster
Designated Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, Wednesday with the president of Italy will meet to present the new government who will face a crisis that has placed to Italy on the brink of madness the economic disaster and has put in danger all the eurozone.
An official notice of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can train a Government.
One hopes that present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although is not clear when the new executive will assume the position.
Monti said that it will present to the president the turn out of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to train a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to surpass this difficult phase”, said the ex- European commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not say of explicit form that it will be able to train a government but the tone of their commentaries indicated that the obstacles have been surpassed.
The “frame however is delineated”, it added.
Monti has completed the process to less than train a government in three days, much less of the normal thing, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has impelled the costs of their debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration directed by ex- European commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity demanded by the European leaders to recover the struck confidence in Italy.
Emphasizing the pressure on Monti so that quickly, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian bonds BTP to 10 years over 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer's association Confindustria, said to the press after meeting with Monti: “We said that we would support much to this government”.
We think that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy leaves this situation in emergency.
The possibilities of success of Monti were impelled of considerable form by the endorsement of party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, to whom the crisis forced to resign Saturday.
“We think that the efforts of professor Monti are destined to have a good result”, said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the divided major of Italy, is significant because until now many of their members had been against to the Government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have a fort parliamentary support to apply what probably they will be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could bring about a new and devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was added to the pressure when warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti initiated Monday its consultations with political parties, enterprise unions and groups, as well as with youthful organizations and of women.
It will at night put aim to its round of meetings Tuesday.
Monti was named the Sunday by Neapolitan, that has qualified an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breathing at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to levels critics between the uncertainty on if new prime minister is successful.
To rescue to Italy, with a national debt of 1,8 trillions of Euros, would be too much for the present financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government would have to last until the next elections, anticipated for 2013, in spite of the generalized predictions envelope that the politicians only will give time to apply the reforms him before advancing the elections.
Monti has said that it would like to include politicians in its cabinet, but the great parties insist on which it must be in favor formed only of technicians, an indication of their repairs before a process forced by the financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that the mutual distrusts and the discords being the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rubbing of the Spaniards is superior to the one of the ticos
Of the 22 called soccer players of Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
From the side of Costa Rica one of the 22 only summoned it arrived at the 50 encounter.
A capital resistance to the one of Costa Rica, if the 22 are compared summoned by both countries for the friendly one of today, to the 3:05 p.m., in the National Stage of San José.
While the world-wide champions and of Europe, number one of ranquin monthly of the FIFA, enter an ample registry of games interselections of class To, Tricolor only owns to the defender Michael Umaña like the only one who has the 50 international parties.
This number reached it previous Friday in the party against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish soccer players who play in the League of Stars and powerful clubs of the League Premier of England, maintain to the year an intense activity in championships of league and domestic glass, and shocks of high level in European glasses like Champions League.
To the previous thing the experience with the Spanish Fury in eliminatory complicated of the Eurocopa and the World-wide one of soccer is added to him.
The ticos soccer players, on the contrary, own a limited international rubbing in a zone, like the Concacaf, that is considered the one of lower level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum registry of the Spanish Selection is of the Íker goalkeeper Squares, that previous Saturday before England (fallen 0-1 in London) the registry of the exportero Andoni Zubizarreta equaled, with 126 international encounter.
Squares will play today before Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internacionalidades.
Xavi Hernandez, cerebral steering wheel of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by the UEFA next to the other centenaries of the Iberian equipment, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centennial number he is almost Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They follow Xabi Alonso to him, with 91\; Fernando Torres, with 90\; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81\; Andrés Iniesta, with 62\; Cesc Fábregas, with 61\; and David Silva, with 53.
Of the side tico, and near Michael Umaña, is lateral the left Diaz Junior, with 48 presences and artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After there, five only surpassed the 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The minuses.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain they appear Gérard I itched (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
Of the national side, with less than 30 presences, they appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not approach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar it only owns one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not make debut.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 morning calls, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers plus so many with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included to the country in its tour of celebration of two decades of trajectory
“To go to Costa Rica it is a dream made reality”
In exclusive interview with Alive, the bear Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer the one of its better concerts next Sunday, in the National Stage.
They have been more than 20 years of delay, but the band assures that for them it will also be to turn in fact the dream to touch in the country.
Thus it assured the bear and charter member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Alive, from Brazil, the past week.
The grouping is in the South American wing of its tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will appear in the National Stage, as of the 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles band The X and the nationals of the Robertas.
This it is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in La Nación in Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, Pearl Jam is a dream made reality that is going to touch in Costa Rica, they are conscious than his are living fans?
To go to Costa Rica is a dream made reality for us also.
This is hardly ours second time in Sur and Central America and until now has been huge.
I only have been in Costa Rica once and of vacations\; it is a so beautiful country and I believe that we are going to be able to have left some there days.
So it moves to take our music there to us.
I ask it because a species of devotion exists towards the band, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What say to his more fervent followers to them?
Thanks to remain to our side through all these years.
It took almost 21 years us to arrive at Costa Rica\; thanks to have hoped as much and we were sorry that as much time in arriving until there has taken us.
Some people already even talk about to her concert like the greatest show of the year.
It adds that a little pressure to him to its visit?
Some of shows greater than we have touched during last the 21 years happened during the last pair of weeks.
We touch a pair of shows gigantic in Sao Paulo and hoped that has put to us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we are very anxious to touch there.
We love that country, it enchants to us to surf and the jungle\; for both things, Costa Rica is between the best ones of the world.
How it was that they discovered Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friendly that are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarind and the waves are incredible there.
My friendly always were going away to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, is great places to surf\; thus it was how we found out, by means of people who love the surf.
When seeing the tour, has come giving shows enormous with many songs.
What have glided for their presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never touched there before, then we do not have any restriction exceeds what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs\; we will try to touch a pair of songs of each album and to give ours fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
To what this is due?
I believe that it is partially because we have nine discs and we can touch more than 120 songs and to each it likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs to touch every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we took short while of not touching, that maintains to us focused and also it maintains to us surprised because it remembers the reasons to us by which we liked those songs and that it was possible to have been forgotten to us.
That causes that the show is more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that also he returns more interesting it for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
When looking back, it is difficult to believe everything what they have obtained?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that no of us I imagine that we would be in a great band of rock and it to have done by more than 20 years it causes that it seems as a dream.
We continue counting our together blessings and it moves much to us that we can continue making music.
All we are wanted and it enchants to us to create music.
We are lucky to go to places of the world to which always we wanted to go.
The things could not be better for us.
What meant for you the salary it are been fundamental part of the sprouting of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very friendly of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a friendly group and is something little common.
From time to time, a band arises from a city, but he is much more strange when five or ten bands leave a same city at the same time.
We are proud and honest of being part of the group of Seattle.
Still we touched with some of them from time to time.
The last year, we were in a festival with Stakes out in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we are lucky of to be friendly of all of them still and us honor to be part of that sound of Seattle that arose.
Also he is very strange that a band as the one of you stays united and with the same members therefore time.
Yes, four of us we have we are in favor together of 21 years and Matt (Cameron) was united to us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much more time del that lasts many bands.
First of all, I believe that all we are lucky to be still with life and, in second, all we worried about the others.
All we are friendly very near and, thanks to that, also musical avenues have been opened that give freedom him each to experiment.
We trusted some to the other with the music of each and it could not better be.
The relation of you with the word fame has not been simple\; nevertheless, thanks to his success, they have been able to do what they want.
How they find a balance?
To since we have been growing, it has been easier to find a balance.
We made sure that not being too much of tour because it is easy to fall in that game of the great multitudes and the people that loves your music.
While one remembers that people are in favor there of music, that remembers you that you must respect music and what brought it, without encaprichar for being famous and to be a rock star, something that to no of us really interests to him.
How remember its other does project Mother Love Bone?
I believe that we wrote very good songs and at the outset was something huge.
We were a band by almost three years and we never published a disc until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because it lasted as much and most important it is than still we are very friendly of Brushes (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), that began in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo fodder in the incredible person who Andy was and how she made me laugh, always went a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to speak of music and soccer much more to us and.
He was a surprising human being and we surprised it.
The national band the Robertas will be the one in charge to open the show in Costa Rica.
It is certain that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and who for that reason they chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent videos to us with several proposals and that was the band that we liked more, so we are anxious to see what the Robertas can offer live and to very have to be entertained.
Why always they negociate the bill of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings it and I believe that he does with first who happens himself to him.
Like bear, which are their influences?
They are so many.
Within first that is happened to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski…
They are so many that could speak all evening on the bears who enchant to me.
How managed has Pearl Jam to already maintain excellent grunge in spite of not being a fashion?
I believe that all we always felt a little disconnected the word grunge.
When fodder in her, remembers the bands to me that I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that arose at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I believe that he is something wonderful because it is music that is worth the pain to listen and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At the outset, its music had a darker content and now she has become more positive.
To what this change is due?
It is interesting because I believe that there is a pair of songs in the new album that perhaps seem lighter, but also is songs, like The End or Just Breathe that describe as very dark songs although can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them to me, I cried when I listened to them and are deeply dark songs.
I believe that when increase and is some trauma in your life and a relative or a friend loses themselves to, those things begin to influence your art and your music and those two songs, without a doubt, represent that for me.
Also, I believe that it is possible to be a happy person and even so to be able to make music that is dark.

The 12 occupants left to the property the noon of yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived the neighbors on the 51 of the street of Balmes has arrived at its aim.
Twelve people left the noon of yesterday voluntarily the building who occupied illegally, and where they organized macrocelebrations that were hopeless to the neighborhood, by warrant and without needing a police intervention.
When the operation finished, the bolt of the door changed to avoid that the situation is repeated.
“From now on there will be an access control”, affirmed the administrator.
Okupas, that had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest is inhabited, took all the electrical system and leaves from the one of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues of all type, mainly broad of spirits.
Three first stage was the scene of the multitudinal celebrations, that lasted up to two days and made hopeles the renters.

Her proprietor, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press who since the building was occupied the business has lowered a 80%.
The proprietor of the discotheque aims that the invaders of the property did unfair competition to him, since they sold the glasses to three Euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, proprietor of the premises of leisure had had to respond to denunciations ocal by noise, while, according to she aimed, the annoyances do not cause them the clients of the discotheque, but inhabitants of house okupada and, mainly, assistants to celebrations that was organized there, who had increased to their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the zone.
The person in charge of the discotheque explained that the annoyances were so great that reached an agreement with the proprietor of the building and even for nine months “has been pardoning” the rent to him.

Park or mountain?
The architects agree in the opportunity of the call beyond controversial on honoraria
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the paper of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of the 80, in the heat of apogee of already the extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some pasquines of promotion of Collserola.
The pamphlet defined the mountain like the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
It is more, was accompanied by a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park returned to be placed, in the imaginary one of many, like the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented above in the North-South axis but (mountain) - down (mar).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park results in this idea.
The reference no longer was Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the paper of the bear Yogi.
In these one was until, in September, the city council summoned a megacompetición composed by 16 contests for other so many access doors to Collserola.
A door sends to the park idea, without a doubt.
Or that or somebody tries to put doors to the field.
The question leaves single: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, as much by its merely organizational slope as reason why it supposes of reflection on the city is the subject of conversation between all the Barcelonan architects.
It is almost already a subject appellant to which to make use when two chosen members of this old chaste one of are clear in an elevator.
And this fact gives foot, exactly, to one of the few coincidences between which three Barcelonan architects think, and university professors, who have appeared.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayonne: the contest is opportune.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front “one becomes necessary” to debate on “the mountain front”, every time the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, the one of green apples, has not taken to end.
“It is possible to start off of the base of which the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among others things by its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex”, it sentences the architect for whom the title of “doors of Collserola” locks up a “lexical trap”: it is not necessary to think about them “like the accesses to a park, but the boundary of some zones where there is to act”.
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the city-planning world, describes the proposal as “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers”.
Dangers derived from the “uncertain thing that it is nowadays to project the public space” after the experience lived in the 80 and that “its swan song” had in the zone of the Fòrum.
The first fear is the own boundary of some opposite exceeds where it is possible to be constructed.
“To limit something it is to already determine the following step”, that is to say, its amble.
“It is necessary to think about new city-planning instruments, of planning, because present [with reference to the General Plan Metropolitano (PGM)] can give foot to authentic disasters”.
More fitted to the question, Mòdol it thinks that, simplifying, the vallesana slope of Collserola “can be understood like a park, the one of Barcelona, not”, by a merely topographic question.
Mòdol remembers that already it exists a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that “does not have to fall in broken coat”, although is thankful for the opportunity that the city council offers to its union to take part in this project “from the first moment”.
And still more, it understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but “doubt” on if the one is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary equipment (“everything a success”, it aims) which they have had to create: “The architects we would only have to be a tool”.
Bayonne insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest it lacks a global vision of Collserola: “16 cross-sectional contests have been summoned - mountain-sea says in the sense, but a longitudinal reading does not exist, that sees and understands the area as a whole”.
It causes, at least if so, that has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can hit in program and definition the one of the architect of the door of alongside.
In its opinion, that yes, the city council would have to guarantee that the strip immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt would have to anticipate, in all their extension, a zone of equipment that carried out a smooth transition between the city and the green thing.
Casino pardons to Jonás Larrazábal and will leave free
After 72 days of root, the legal proxy of the Casino Network granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed to him by presumed blackmails
After to remain 72 days imprisoned, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will leave in freedom after which the legal proxy of the Casino Network granted the pardon to him before the Secondly Penal Court of District, that follows a process by blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack to the Royale Casino, the proprietor of the Casino Network, Sergio Gil Garcia, made public a series of photographies and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás demanded the payment to him of an economic quota so that the regiomontano city council allowed the clandestine operation of the house of bets.
After the public denunciation, the state Office of the judge advocate general opened a penal process against the brother of the PAN mayor and the 2 of September were stopped and ingrained by 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, it was transferred to the House of Root 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
In that place it remained during the 49 days following when dictating him one second order of root after which the agent of the Public Ministry rejected to the crimes of bribe and organized crime.
The 19 of October were transferred to the penitentiary of Cadereyta presumably to blackmail with a million and average of weights to the proprietors of the Casino Network\; nevertheless, she only remained some hours in the median prison security since threats of death in his existed against.
The authorities allowed him to follow the judgment committed in the municipal cells of San Nicholas of the Heron.
The 25 of October turned order to him of apprehension by the secretary of the Secondly Penal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that to almost two months of inquiries sufficient tests were verified to determine the culpability of Jonás, such as the collection of 1,5 million weights to the representatives of the house of bets in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal proxy of Casino Network, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, went before judge Jose Luis Pecina to ask for the pardon for the brother of the regal mayor\; reason why in the next hours it could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the assigned Public Ministry to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garcia Gomez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the house of bets was the one that granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
With base to file 197/2011 the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal is granted and claim will not be able in the future to appear some around the process that was followed to him\; apart from which repair of damage nor punishment will not be demanded to him.
After the hearing to the legal proxy of the house of bets, near the 15:50 it became ordained the immediate freedom of Breton Larrazabal.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved until the jail of the municipality of San Nicholas of the Heron to notify to Jonás that has been pardoned legally and its file will be filed.
Also it will notify it of the order of immediate freedom that emitted the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the secretary of Interior, Francisco Blake was killed, and seven people more
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results thrown on the accident where the secretary of Interior, Francisco Blake Mora was killed more, and seven people, indicate that the helicopter was hit of direct way on the land in complete structural integrity, without the pilot could try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before taking off the airship, the pilot stated that the conditions of climate were the adapted ones to fly.
“The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several ground contacts, the vanes had contact with trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage”.
Also it informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, reason why counted on the requirements necessary to transport the personnel.
In addition, it said that in the investigations done in the zone of the impact the appearance of pieces in the land is not reported.
“In a search they are reported that there are pieces or components of the no ship in another place, the impact appeared of structural form.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, counted on suitable requirements to transport the passengers.
The land presents a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to count on the before possible results\; nevertheless, the investigation can last several months, even could reach a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Auxiliary general director of Airports and Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential staff operated in cruise speed and that this happened in an ascending soft land.
“This information fortifies the hypothesis of a normal operation of cruise at the time of the impact”, it expressed.
In the press conference, the holder of SCT, Perez Jácome, enumerated six element excellent in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical standardization the flight was realized under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the land.
Meteorological conditionses:
The reports in the AICM located conditions adapted to the takeoff, in agreement it advances the airship towards the bordering area between the DF and the State of Mexico layers of cloudiness to low height appeared.
Selected routes:
It is probable that by the conditions of cloudiness the crew has looked for a zone of smaller elevation and major visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last registry of the airship of the radar agree, probably before the impact was no loss of control nor alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of rest of the airship in a reduced zone:
The information available until the moment allows to suppose that the impact happened in a straight trajectory and of side.
The landlord of dispersion of rest of the airship allows to suppose that the helicopter was hit in the land in conditions of structural integrity.
Evidence of fire or explosion has not been detected:
In the site of the wreck they follow without revealing evidences in the rest of the ship of some type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that it could have had multiple ground contacts.
During the works of field pieces of the airship to an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet have been on the mean sea level, the land presents a slope that goes from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographies show the sequence in which foreseeably it disarticulated throughout this route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts in the land.
After the meticulous search in a zone ampler than the surrounded site, around the accident, have not been dispersed pieces of the airship, which fortifies the presumption of which the impact appeared in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
It directs to the Social Insurance an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in children and young people\; it is supported in specialists of the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Seguro Social (IMSS) announced that it directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in children and young people, denominated Genetic protocol “of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence”, that will allow to tell on associated markers the overweight.
In an official notice, the commander of the Unit of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical center 21st century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, social nurses was integrated, nutriólogos and workers.
This equipment is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate of the National Institute of Salud Pública (INSP) and of the Advanced Study and Research center (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnical Institute (IPN).
In the investigation it is invited to participate to the population is or nonrightful claimant, to go to the participant sport units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, all the Saturdays as of the 8:00 hours.
It emphasized that the protocol began in the Sport Unit Cuauhtémoc (Been of Mexico the West) and that from the 8 of October, the activity is carried out in the Sport Unit Nezahualcóyolt (Been of Mexico East).
Once the objective is fulfilled to reunite to 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Unit Independence (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Sport Unit Dwell them (to the north of the Federal District).
It explained that the intention of this investigation is to know the components and the importance the genetics with respect to the development of the obesity and of identifying in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the appearance with degenerative diseases chronic.
When being celebrated this 14 of November the World-wide Day of the Diabetes, needed that the objective is to reunite to three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of its parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on feeding.
Also one will ask on the physical activity and antecedent heredofamiliares to them of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger sufferings like diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It detailed that Saturdays it is applied to all the participant anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of waist), arterial ramming intake, genetic determination of the glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and (looks for to identify genes that are associated to the infantile obesity).
Lopez cross indicated that this investigation obeys to the preoccupation of the professionals of the health by the alarming increase of weight in the minors.
“The surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of the children, of 77 percent in obesity, and the children of 47 percent\; in terms of overweight also a dramatic ascent was observed”, emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is sustained in which the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
30 European percent informed that in average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian inheritance, and five African percent and this condition are reflected in the genes that are associated to diabetes and excess of weight.
It explained that of general way, the genetics of the obesity is translated in the incapacity to burn the excess of energy that we consumed (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they present some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, it said, the presence of you fold of dark color (acantosis) in neck and forearm, that indicate the probability that it suffers metabolic alterations and until prediabetes.
The information is handled of confidential form, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, to those who it explains each one of the measurements and the changes to them in the lifestyle which they must realize to prevent diseases.
Lopez cross explained that three main components exist that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic sufferings: the sedentary lifestyle, that is the lack of daily physical activity, to most of remain the day seated in front of the television and to use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Also the greater carbohydrate, sweetened drink consumption is due to the high caloric ingestion, that is to say, (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, et cetera) with lifted content in fats and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid pockets
Rafael Herrera, investigator of the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, independent of the environmental conditions and of temperature
If the signals that sends the pavement were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair near 200 thousand pockets every season of rains in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, noticed Rafael Herrera Nájera, investigator of the Faculty of Química (FQ) of the UNAM, that assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is the adapted one, the pockets could be reduced in amount or, even, be eliminated completely.
In its conference a technological opinion of the pockets, within the framework dictated of the Year the International of Chemistry, presented that the laboratory to its position develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, as much to high as to low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this modified asphalt type could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities of the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of pockets.
It explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a hydrocarbon molecule set, some of high molecular weight, calls asphaltene, and others of low molecular weight, maltenos calls, that together give to the pavement their characteristic viscoelástico behavior him.
The viscoelástico behavior of the asphalt consists of which to high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees Celsius his viscosity is very high and to 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, whereas to very low temperatures, asphalt becomes fragile, added.
The previous thing means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day in agreement with the environmental conditions and of temperature, it noticed the specialist in chemical engineering.
The investigator of the FQ observed that the streets of the City of Mexico in their majority are covered by flexible pavement, which is made up of six layers of materials, of which last the three involve to asphalt.
Between the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, conformed by small stones bathed in asphalt and soon compacted.
Each one of the piedritas that the folder constitutes, aimed, is bathed with asphalt.
When journeying the vehicles and being generated efforts, this one allows that the forces spread very well in the pavement.
If one were modified asphalt would spread still better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, it is placed a last called layer tread folder, which is made of a fine material of stone, that is to say, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As one is the layer that is going to be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction in the way.
To the being the part of the pavement that is going to receive and to spread the efforts, the tread folder requires, also, to have the suitable thickness and the material is due to take care of del that is done.
The climate, especially the humidity and the variations of temperature, are also a factor very important to consider, especially the water, said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the land becomes damp, the water spreads inside the folder and is difficult that it leaves, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of pockets.
In the process of formation of a pocket, it said, first in being worn away is the bearing film and only later the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not happen very instantaneously, but it is a process that would have to be taken care of the first signals with adapted maintenance programs.
The also member one of the National System of Investigators explained that the load to carry is another important factor in the formation of pockets and, for this reason, the thickness of each one of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the load to carry and to guarantee that it is fulfilled, to avoid that pockets form frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that still there is much to investigate and to work on asphalt, for example, the asphalt emulsions, that in other countries already are even in the market and allow to repair the pockets with facility and without needing using high temperatures.
What needed to the candidate of the Valley to be the new Colombia young lady?
Analysis of the factors that affected so that Melina Ramirez Serna did not reach the crown of Colombia Young lady.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princess.
Again the Valley of the Cauca remains with the desire of the crown of Colombia Young lady.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to conform to being in the podium of winners, shining the crown of silver and the band that credit it like new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic young lady raised with the crown and the sceptre, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina an the legion of vallecaucanas women who are been near the crown but which they were proclamations princess among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Raises to you (1983), Olga Maria Sands (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consoles Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many become is What lacked?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that it had everything to be the new Colombia Young lady, not in vain Queen of the Police and Better Face Jolie de Vogue was chosen, titles that queens like Taliana Vargas obtained or Natalia Navarro who they took the crown of Colombia Young lady.
The first factor that considers key in the decision that took the jury to designate it First Princess is in which it did not convince with his answer to the question “Which is that book that has marked to you and why? done by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the Literary Cart We read.
To the interrrogante the vallecaucana responded:
“Leo much, I create enough in Literature, I believe that it is a form to culturalizar itself, definitively I believe that the book that marked to me of childhood is “the little prince”, it is a quite deep book.
At the moment I read “Crime and punishment”, it is a book of universal Literature that all we must read\; and nowadays I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, the most beautiful book that is called “the ardor of the blood "".
An answer that little liked first by the term “to culturalizar itself” and secondly not to explain of concrete way how each one of the books that mentioned have marked it.
But when finalizing the Melina ceremony showed to feel calm and happy with the result “the universe is wise happens what must happen.
And for all the people, please they read just a little bit, “the little prince” is a great book”
Between the sent hypotheses one says that to Valley the favoritism burned it.
A of Bogota journalist insinuated that to the being the favorite, ovationed and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (challenge of Oster gastronomy, vote of the public by the best artisan suit, and Queen Mother), “that woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the queen and for that reason she did not shine in the scene”.
And that noticed in his first presentation in suit of bath in the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation.
Although in both it shone safe, one noticed that it needed to the force and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic yes demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program “Like at home”, of the RCN Channel thought that the fact that Melina was designated princess “verifies that the candidate who more prizes wins during the contest is not as reigns”.
In addition, Valley was last the very aloof thing with the press, and there it was mistaken.
Another hypothesis is that Valley did not manage to convince to the jury on its interest towards the social work, that is in last, the essence of the National Contest of Beauty.
By something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they looked for a woman it jeopardize with the social needs of their country.
“The single beauty is not enough in a Colombia Beauty queen, is necessary to look beyond the physicist and to concentrate in its social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest already is involved in projects”, explained.
Also it is speculated on that Valley sinned by its defects in derriere and the fibrosis that noticed to him in its abdomen, but is contradictory then indeed the jury chose it as the candidate “natural Beauty” with the healthiest body, good feeding and responsible physical work.
The trainer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, than had better, “but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for my was not very well-known, lowered to points day in the last to him”.
In the meantime Guido journalist Holes, of the magazine Chromiums considers that the error of the vallecaucana was the operations that practiced.
“The surgeries are well, but Valley did not know them to do.
Its body never was its fort and here they received it”.
By this prize, that for the first time gives the National Contest of the Beauty, after the parade in bath suit arose a cruel prediction that last night was fulfilled, because contentillo was said that to this era that Raymundo granted to Melina not to be pleasant to him of the crown.
Reality or no, the certain thing is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not like sovereign, but like princess, position that offers the possibility him of representing Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the own National Contest.
Nevertheless, it will happen to the history as one of the queens that in spite of its sweeping passage by Cartagena, was to him aloof the crown.
Thus it was the work of the Cali that identified the corpse of White Alfonso
A lofoscopista of Cali happened to history like the man who confirmed the death of “White Alfonso”.
The work of these civil servants is key.
The past 4 of November a lofoscopista of the CTI of Cali happened to history like the man who confirmed the identity of the top head of the CRAF: “White Alfonso”, through check off of its fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas that toil in the sectional one of the CTI, that week touched the turn to him of “availability” to Eliazar González, a Tiled man of Port that has been 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
When initiating its race, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where often it had to go into by more than five days in the forest to arrive at the site in which they were the corpses that had to be identified.
In the 2000 one moved to the capital of the Valley and, after realizing the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopia, that is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say, Las Palmas of the hands and the feet.
The week of the operative one against White Alfonso alias to Eliazar they noticed to him that it wore minimum clothes for three days.
Something great hoped to him.
Friday at night left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
It knew that it had to identify two corpses and that one suspected that one of them was of the man who directed to the oldest guerilla of the world, reason why they asked to him that he took the card to decadactilar of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (its true name).
Nevertheless, when it arrived with the equipment from investigation at the site in which was the corpse did not recognize it by its physical aspect, because it was very different from which had seen in mass media.
It was without beard, dress like a farmer of the zone, without glasses and much more thin.
But the tracks do not lie.
Accompanied by a galtoniana, red magnifying glass, a transplantador and a lantern, Eliazar it compared the digital impressions of the corpse with those of the card.
Its eye did not fail to him: he was “White Alfonso”.
That same night, the native man of Tiled Port was the one in charge to confirm the minister to him of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who yes was the top head of the CRAF.
In search of the track
For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín of Cali the recognition that president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González did, in the press conference by operative the con “White”, is very significant.
Much people do not know our work.
The fingerprinting is an exact science, without allowable error, that can get to be key in the resolution of crimes.
Aside from the corpse identification, the lofoscopistas support investigations by crimes as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the caught people.
When they are captured, many delinquents present false certificates or they do not have papers.
We took the digital impression them and we looked for them in the data base.
The investigator told that, in a case of theft, he was called on to him to clear a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to remove to a box strong full from jewels and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to remove a digital impression, but in that case we could obtain the track of all the hand and to identify the delinquent, who had participated in different thefts”, remembered.
The tracks can discard or also reaffirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently they found a died man, with bottles of liquor to his around.
By means of the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspicious of the crime and, indeed, a track in the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the assassin, yes locates it in the scene of the crime.
A dactiloscopista of the CTI explained that in the objects “the tracks remove with chemical or physical reagents”.
When they appear, a transplantador or tape is used to raise them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal data base, or to the Registraduría.
“The problem is that still there are many undocumented Colombians”, indicated the expert of the CTI.
It clarified that everything is not as is in the program of CSI television.
As well as everything what shines is not gold, not everything what it is touched becomes track.
Nevertheless, if it can be used, if the respective check off is realized.
The “indignant ones” defy to authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were crowded before the Zuccotti place to encamp.
A great part took care of the evacuation order and it moved to paruqe near.
The members of the movement Occupy Wall Street defied this Tuesday to the authorities from New York when trying to enter again, under the shelter of a warrant, to the place of Manhattan of where they were evacuated at daybreak and when trying to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were crowded before the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to accede thanks to a warrant that allows the “indignant ones” to return to encamp in the place, whereas another part of the movement responded to the evacuation occupying a park more to the north of the city, where there have been new haltings.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to encamp in the place, we are going away to install in some other place and will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through seating and pacific manifestations”, said one of the spokesmen of the movement “Occupies Wall Street”, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the answer of the “indignant ones” to the evacuation of its camping dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived until the courts, where judge Lucy Billings emitted an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay encamped.
In addition, the “indignant ones” came to the occupation to a new park located in the confluence from centric the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, closely together of the entrance to the tunnel Holland, that unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least during one hour they were able to occupy the place, but later the Police went and came to stop to some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete number, while she assured to Efe that saw several journalists who also were handcuffed.
The organization assures that those are several hundreds of people that had settled in that point, where a delegation of religious leaders in sample of support to the members of the movement already has itself displaced and that it has tried to mediate with the Police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti place - that is an enclosure of private property follows closed in the hope of the celebration of an anticipated judicial view for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this dawn is due to analyze.
Some of the displaced demonstrators until carried and distributed to these hours copies of that warrant there and they even gave them to the agents who guarded the place, which brought about “some small confrontations”, it indicated Bray, whom it denounced that some officials offered blows to the demonstrators.
The warrant prohibits to the authorities to evacuate to the members of Occupies Wall Street or to apply “laws that were published after the occupation began or to prohibit the demonstrators to again accede to the park with stores or other properties that used previously”.
Bloomberg mayor indicated before the press that, due to that warrant, the city had suspended the re-opening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, to whom it alerted, nevertheless, that the local laws do not allow them to become to install with sleeping bag and tents.
The councillor personally defended the carried out evacuation at daybreak of the Zuccotti place, an operation in which it came to around 200 haltings and that were decided because the demonstrators were “breaking the law”.
Bloomberg explained that it issued the order to evacuate the place because this one was becoming “a place in which the people do not venÍan to protest, but to break the laws and, in some cases, to make damage to other people”, since “some businesses habÍan received threats” and the neighbors temÍan “by their quality of life”.
“The evacuation of this dawn was revolting and demonstrates that at heart Bloomberg more is interested in preserving the financial interests that those of the American workers”, added the spokesman of the movement, that the freedom of expression accused the mayor “to need the respect”.
The people in charge of “Occupy Wall Street” also indicated that they think to organize “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with communitarian organizations and unions, to both commemorate months that last the protests, that began the 17 of September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin special Maria in a Christmas one of television
Next to Michael Bublé and other Canadian outstanding, he will appear in the program of television “It's to Russell Peters Christmas” next the 1 of December
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in “Home Improvement”, person who renders first aid in “Baywatch”, conejita of “Playboy”, the wife of the musician of Tommy Lee rock and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Maria in a special one of Christmas of the Canadian television.
The deprived channel of television CTV announced today that Anderson, along with “crooner” (crooner) Michael Bublé and other Canadian outstanding, will appear in the program of television “It's to Russell Peters Christmas” next the 1 of December giving life to a very particular Virgin Maria.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also well-known by the ample distribution in Internet of a pornographic homemade video in which he appears along with his then husband, the battery of “Mötley Crüe”, Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Maria maintaining in a manger a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a Canadian humorous well-known of Indian origin that recently acted like presenter partly of the tour “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” of Charlie Sheen, appears like Jose.
Besides Anderson and Peters, special the Christmas one of CTV has the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called “vixen” to the American Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts in New York.
Japan appears again after the earthquake
The GDP grows a 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that it initiated in March
From the past month of March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that happened in a nuclear crisis, the worse catastrophe than it suffered the Japanese country from II the World war.
The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo based the material losses in 300.000 million dollars, a blow that, in spite of the difficult world-wide context, seems to have attenuated.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of Gross domestic product between July and September served to pass page, definitively: the GDP was increased a 1.5% in comparison with the previous trimester and a 6% in annual rate.
The registered one in the second trimester - for the Japaneses, the fiscal year begins in March of 2012 - supposes, in addition, the greater rate of growth from the period of January to March of 2010.
The recovery is explained, partly, by the rise of the purchase of machinery to recover the zones devastated by the seism and the later tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments in a 1.1%, against the reduction of 0.9% in expenses of capital that was observed of January March, the first backward movement after six months of uninterrupted ascents.
Nevertheless, true the revulsive one of the Japanese economy is not exclusively based on the Keynsian impulse that it invites to take advantage of the crises to reinforce - or to reconstruct - infrastructures, to use as the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has waked up, mainly, thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, that at present represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable scaled a 1%, pushed by the increase of the cost in vehicles, trips and activities of leisure.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the inner market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the “values refuge” selected by the investors who flee from the crisis of debt in the euro area and the turbid forecasts of EE.UU., a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a currency hard, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic waterline comes determined by the health from the great technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the quote of the yen.
While the markets follow with their siege the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
“It is necessary to be kind to the risks that persist, like the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen”, indicated yesterday the Secretary of State of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the perspective are not encouraging.
The Organization for the Cooperation and the Economic Development (OECD) needed that the majority of the Member States presented in September clearer plus signs of economic slowing down.
The indicator that anticipates the points of flection in the global economy put of relief that the main powers are stopping.
Since it lowered four tenth until the 100.4 points, against the 100.8 of August.
The euro area, even, was placed below the average, that is in level 100, when hurrying eight tenth until the 99.13 points.
Athens returns to feed the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral premiums of risk shot and the uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece continues romping in the labyrinth that leads towards the exit of the great crisis of European debt.
The sensation from which the “consensus” of the new Government of Greek transition comes more imposing by the exigencies of Brussels that by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to confirm itself with facts.
While new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, noticed yesterday that there is no alternative for the structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days decided in his designation it remains perhaps short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not endorse new measures of austerity in any case and reiterated his exigency of new elections for the anticipated date, the 19 of February.
“The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summit of the 26 of October”, asserted Papadimos when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to impel the use, the reform of the disciplinary code of the civil servants and new measures against the fiscal evasion will be the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras does not clear the doubts on its position: “We have ourselves it jeopardize to help to the Government of transition, but we do not have ourselves it jeopardize to nothing else”.
The preservative leader was a little step more far in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the organisms that must unblock 8,000 million that Athens needs with urgency, and made clear that it will not give his approval to any letter of undertaking of fulfillment of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still stung by the impact brought about by órdago of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its exigency is firm: it will not unblock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign “a commitment written without ambiguity and as rapidly as possible”.
Spokesman of Economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will not return “in a moment” to Athens to discuss with the new Government “which is needed to pay the sixth section” of 8,000 million, although is definitive date either.
The Greek hank still has thread for short while.
Do6na Sofia: “They are instruments for the progress and the hope”
Reina emphasizes “the preponderant” place of Spain in relation to this type of finances
Spain “has reached a preponderant place to world-wide level in the paper of Microfinanzas”.
Reina Do6na Sofia remembered yesterday that the country has become these two last decades in the second donor of raises in relation to this intrumento of cooperation, whose “essence” indicated that it is in being a “instrument for the social progress, the justice and the hope of a better future for all the humanity, based on the confidence in the human being”.
Reina inaugurated the V yesterday World-wide Summit of the Micro-credit in Valladolid with the conviction of which “there is no doubt” that he is type of operations are “absolutely indispensable” to reach the Objectives of the Millenium established by United Nations with horizon 2015, and, “very especially, in which has as it in the middle of puts the reduction the volume of people who live with income inferiors to a daily dollar, with to that the “poverty line” pays attention.
Spain “continues working” to extend the network of beneficiaries “to all the corners of the planet, and assumes this task with “responsibility”, indicated Do6na Sofia, that she hoped that the initiatives and contributions that are originated in the Summit, that will extend until Thursday, “they guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for poorest, and mainly for the women”, main beneficiaries of these loans.
The reached profits” and “many are “many the challenges which we faced”.
The Summit of the Micro-credit considers not only as a forum of debate, but also like the platform from which to impel “two I put basic”.
Thus, His Majesty explained that she inhales herself to that at the end of 2015 they are the 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that one hundred million those homes leave the poverty line in which they are sunk.
The impulse in the conception of the micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world “has been following the footpath initiated for years of pioneering form” by Muhammad Yunus, rebound Do6na Sofia like a “act of justice and recognition due”.
And it is that it described to the father of this tool as a “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against the poverty”, whose work knows for 15 years, when Reina traveled to Bangladesh to know on the land its policy loans.
This experience they later followed a year the first World-wide Summit to him in Washington and other encounter like the celebrated ones in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and “in all I have been able to state the continuous evolution”, explained His Majesty, whose bond with this project was worth yesterday the denomination to him of the “congregated head of household” in Valladolid on the part of the “jeans of the poor men”.
Finally, Reina Do6na Sofia concluded its intervention animating to the presents to participate in the debate and the search of solutions to advance in the fight against the poverty.
“Imperative ethical”
The minister of Foreign Affairs, Jiménez Trinidad, noticed that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for all democratic state.
In this sense, it exposed that it would be an error to tie the cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, since it is a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez considered that the micro-credits suppose “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicate the poverty”, and now “more than ever” the governments of developed countries they must work under solidarity criteria and not to leave this one is victim of cuts.
For Spain, the micro-credit consists of “one of the main lines of cooperation to the development”.
On the other hand, the Secretary of State of Cooperation the International, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded “the success” to give “confidence” to the people “excluded those who all close the doors”\; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon of Riva, gave the welcome to the presents to a city that “opens its doors infected of the shared in common spirit”.
The CDU proposes to choose to the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 of November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic party.
Initially it was not had including in the daily routine the future of Europe, but the subject prevailed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the policy of the Government is at the moment too much little strict with the Greeks and could in the future be it with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European, propose Commission by the direction, was practically adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, nine votes were only registered against and ten abstentions.
Standing ovation of several minutes that gained, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, eurófilo Minister of Finances, clears any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, summary in a motto: the answer to the crisis “is not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe supposes La Paz, but also because “nine million uses depend directly on the Euro”.
For the Chancellor, “the hour has arrived to lay way in Europe”.
This could be pronounced in modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon to allow to reinforce the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the zone of the Euro, although also it could end at the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage for “giving a face him to Europe”.
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is little probable that the twenty-seven reach an agreement quickly on this radical change: Great Britain is hostile before him and the leaders of the CDU seem to also know that Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the ball is on the land.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central bank based on the weight of each economy, which evidently would reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxious to calm the spirits inside his party, the Chancellor has increased to the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But he is not either that he has tried to gain to his congress at the cost of “the small” European countries or of the countries in ready difficulties to criticize to arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of “the French-German friendship”, Angela Merkel has not mentioned to France.
Safe of past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, took place a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, she was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleón.
The incidence of the fraud in the sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against the sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 of November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for the familiar subsidies and to deliver a speech on the subject, already appellant from 2007, of the fight against the social fraud and the assistantship.
In addition, to accompany so offensive, that it leaves from the will to save of rigorous form, but even so it remembers to an axis of the presidential campaign of rights, the majority wants to concentrate in the sick leave.
First of all, to apply budgetary cuts: the Government anticipates to impose to the workers of the private sector a fourth day of deficiency before being able to take the loss.
Really, unless a specific agreement of company exists, a worker that falls ill would lose four days of wage, that is to say, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
One is a measurement that could raise a wrath big wave, but that would allow to save 280 million Euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would go accompanied of another measurement with a more symbolic reach: to impose to the civil servants a day of deficiency without remuneration in case of labor loss (until the moment, they do not have deficiency, against the three days who are applied in the private sector).
While these questions struggle, the majority returns to also put on the table the subject of the fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of the labor losses.
“The controls Are going to be increased considerably and, in addition, if it is discovered to somebody committing a fraud, it will have to reimburse the quantities”, noticed Xavier Bertrand speaking in the RTL the Sunday 13 of November.
Like in the other cases, the effects of the announcement slightly seem out of proportion for the reality of the fraud in the matter of labor losses.
In fact, from 2002 a constant pursuit of this question is realized and diverse political offensives have been sent that, normally, have borne fruit.
The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.
We observe with attention, first of all, the national numbers.
According to the French Institute of the social security (CNAM), in 2006 they were paid more than 237 million Euros in benefits by labor losses.
According to the French Institute of investigation and documentation in economy of the health, the subsidies by the losses represented, in 2008, 5% of the sanitary cost, ascending to 11,300 million Euros.
Of this sum, 46% correspond to the maternity leave and by labor accidents, whereas 54% are related to the sick leave, number that ascends to 6,200 million Euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of the cost in health.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days of labor loss, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting group.
An average that, without a doubt, stashes deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 survey French employees affirmed that they had not taken not one day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leave lasted inferior to 8 days, 22% among 8 and 14 days, 15% among 15 days and a month, 15% among one and three months and 11% more were prolonged.
If we compared them with our European neighbors, the French workers are not more prone than in other zones to take sick leave.
A long study realised in 2010 by two investigators of the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence of the work (as much for reasons of health as of another type) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against a 20% and a 28% in Denmark, a 15% in the United Kingdom or between a 16% and a 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the sick leave is not especially significant in comparison with the work nondeclared.
The fraud has a limited reach enough.
The reinforcement of the legislation, from 2002, has caused that the controls of the sick leave of more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspection, the CNAM verified, in a realised 13% of the 285,000, that the losses of short duration were “unwarranted or too long”, that is to say, 37,050 cases.
In the case of the losses of more than 45 days, submissive inspection systematic, it was considered that 11% of the cases “were properly adapted or unwarranted\; a number that, having like game a total of 1.2 million, ascends to 132.000.
Therefore, a total of 169,000 “unwarranted” cases between several million workers is reached who took a sick leave.
Without a doubt, an insignificant number in comparison, for example, with the black work.
According to the deputy of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this question in June, this practice would represent some losses of tax revenues among 9,000 and 15,000 million Euros the year, that is to say, more than the total cost of the subsidies by losses and, without a doubt, considerably more than the fraud in this last scope.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece is going to need a new plan adjustment to straighten its economy.
This is what declared Monday 14 of November, Prime minister Lucas Papadémos before the Parliament\; it also added that the one hundred days that have been granted to their Government of union would not be enough to reach such objective.
“To realize efforts that take to the recovery of the economy, we needed the support our European partners and a new program of budgetary adjustment”, declared the Head of the Government, who pronounced his first public speech during the inauguration of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament Wednesday.
The implementation of a decision adopted during the Summit of the zone of the Euro the 27 of October will be the “main task” of the new government, since “it is in game” the permanence of the country in the zone of the Euro, added.
Consequently, Papadémos has anticipated that the public deficit of the country will be reduced “until around 9%” of the GDP before the end of year, after reaching a 10.6% in 2010 and a 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new measures of austerity
Antonis Samaras, the head of the group of rights, showed to Monday its support the measures already approved to try to leave the crisis of the debt, but it has noticed that its party will not be committed with additional measures of austerity.
“We will not vote in favor of new measures”, affirmed during a meeting with the deputies of its party “New Democracy”.
It indicated that it was in agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and the debt, as well as of fight against the waste, but against any policy that the economic recovery prevents.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner of Monetary Economic affairs and, who noticed that the IMF and the EU they would not unblock the necessary loan of 8,000 million Euros without a guarantee written of the support of all the parties to the anticipated measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of the external pressure.
A committee of experts affirms that euthanasia and the attended suicide must be legalized
The Canadians live denying the death, according to indicates the report of the Real Society of Canada
In the matter of palliative cares, the committee demands that the governments, the institutions of medical assistance and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the best palliative cares, and not only in the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives denying the death.
In fact, only 9% of the Canadians are arranged to speak with their medical one on the conditions in which they wish to die and they take dispositions to this end.
One is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Real Society of Canada, that counted on the participation of six experts of diverse scopes, including the ethical one, legal and the doctor.
This committee recommends to the Government who modifies the penal Code so that he allows the attended suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
In order to begin, the experts mention a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth position, the study indicates that “the medicalización of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the people are scared to deal with the subject the death”.
With medication or no, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative cares, according to indicate the experts selected by the Real Society of Canada.
And, although the majority of the Canadians wishes to die at home, 68.6% of them end up passing away in the hospital.
Altogether, the highest rate in this sense registers it Quebec, where a 86% of the deaths take place in the hospital.
With respect to the delicate subject of euthanasia and the suicide attended, the authors of the report arrived some conclusions that do not agree with the position of the federal Government, who already has declared that does not wish to modify the penal Code in relation to euthanasia and the attended suicide.
Nevertheless, according to experts, that also has studied the situation in all the countries where these practices have been legalized or they do not constitute a penal crime, is no test that the fact that is not considered a crime penal it has not brought about an abuse of its application, that is to say, the use of euthanasia or the suicide attended with noncompetent people or who had not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, affirmed yesterday by videophone conference that, on the contrary, was observed more excesses in those countries where euthanasia nor the attended suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada euthanasia practices, although he is clearly illegal”.
“In Canada the attended suicide practices, although he is clearly illegal”, explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian, the favorable ones to euthanasia
We remember that 85% of the Canadians already have been pronounced in favor of euthanasia, since they think that it would allow the people whose death is next to alleviate its suffering, according to indicates a survey of Angus Reid realised in 2010.
In addition, 66% think that the fact to legalize euthanasia will not give to understand that the life of disabled the old people or has less value.
As far as the people who have practiced the attended suicide, 41% of the survey ones think that a process against them would not have to begin.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of the medical assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to indicate the authors of the report.
In addition, between its recommendations they suggest is indicated in the penal Code that the retirement of the sanitary cares, if they have been rejected legally, does not suppose a penal crime.
The committee of experts also asks that it forms to the sanitary professionals in having to respect the fact that a patient rejects the attendance at the end of his life without fear to face a denunciation.
In the matter of palliative cares, the committee demands that the governments, the institutions of medical assistance and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the best palliative cares, and not only in the cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to the palliative or terminal sedation, that already is used extensively in the sanitary institutions of Canada, the committee asks that, unless serves to reduce the physical pain, it is considered as euthanasia and is put under the same procedures.
Other experts indicate reserves
Other experts of the scope of the Right of health already have indicated their reserves in relation to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in Right of the health, has described as “extreme” the position of the experts who sign the report, among others things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited the patients in final stage.
“This leaves to the door opened to a situation in which somebody that is tired to live and is more than 18 years old can request aid to commit suicide”, indicates Deschamps, that it consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any other value of the society.
However, it adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations”.
The specialist in Right of the health Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” with respect to the conclusions of the report, that she described as “manifesto in favor of euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, puts in judgment fabric especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and the attended suicide are legal, like in the Netherlands and Oregon.

Italy
Monti requests time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested something from time to the markets to form his equipment and to start up a program that will include “sacrifices” destined to recover the lost credibility during the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The old European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the unions and the employer's association.
It would have to form a cabinet relatively restricted, made up of external technocrats the Parliament.
“Monti has spoken of an ample program with numerous sacrifices”, it affirmed Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of abundant the small parliamentary groups that participated in the encounter, after to have reunited with the President of the designated Council.

In the “democracy, there are some terms precise” to train a Government and to prepare its program, emphasized, adding that he is “safe that the markets will have patience and they will understand it”.
Its designation by the President initially obtained the approval of the markets, but later the restlessness prevailed, in particular after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in the zone of the Euro in September.
Designated Prime minister would have to create an equipment mainly formed by technocrats, even if there is outstanding that it would like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to work until 2013, date of next the legislative ones, considers.
According to the President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.

A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, have collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to affirmed to Monday a specialized American NGO in the atomic risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute of Science and International security (ISIS) the International of Energía Atómica is based on a recent report of the Agency (AIEA) and on other documents issued by this agency of the UN.
The AIEA indicated the past week its “serious preoccupation” by a “possible military dimension” of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS, being based extensively on documents of the AIEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, it would have worked during three decades, from years 1960, in a nuclear center military Soviet in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the synthetic diamond manufacture by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to form a company centered in the production of “nanodiamantes” in Kiev.
The economic problems of their company would have taken to him to put itself in contact, in 1995, with the Embassy of Iran in the Ukraine.

In the network, the users have debated to blow of “tweets” with different opinions the interest from this innovation.
“He is useless, it is invasive and it is looked too much like Facebook”, writes @jemb123.
“The function Activity is going to help to me to follow better some elements of my Twitter flow”, writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a “budgetary gold rule” in the Constitution
The Government of great Social-Democratic coalition/Christian Democrat who is in the power in Austria has decided Tuesday to include in the Constitution a “budgetary gold rule” to reduce the public deficit and, thus, to avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria on the part of the agencies of credit qualification (triple A).
He was the own Social-Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Cabinet, when the Austrian national debt reaches 74.6%, a number far beyond the maximum limit of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Agreement, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If the solution of Austria in a single level were reduced, of AAA to AA+, we would have to pay to 3,000 million Euros more in interests every year”, it indicated to the Vice chancellor Christian Democrat of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds thus to a request of the Summit from Brussels to the Member States of the zone of the Euro of the past 26 of October: in her, the Government and Chiefs of State requested the inclusion, before end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government comes near to the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country that type of “rule” adopted.
Before 2017, the structural public deficit would have to diminish every year in a 0.75% of gross domestic product (PIB) and, as of the 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State would not have to surpass every year 0.35% of the GDP, whereas the regional States, as well as the communes, would have to present budgets balances.
The objective consists of which, towards 2020/2021, the national debt is reduced under the criterion of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Agreement.
A strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention of the change market
Japanese Prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, noticed Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again take part the noticeable one of the change if the yen continued increasing.
“We will take part, as we did it the last time, if we verified that an excessive volatileness” in the exchange rate of the yen takes place, explained Noda to the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen ascended until reaching some levels next to the historical maximums that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities the 31 of October.
That one day, Tokyo sold yens by dollars massively to lower the value of the Japanese currency, that finished reaching a new record from 1945 in comparison with the American currency.
But the yen has been overcoming gradually since then, impelled by the purchases of investors who consider a “value refuge” in these uncertain times of world-wide economic slowing down and of crisis of debt in Europe.
The dollar has returned to less than quote Tuesday to 77 yens and the Euro has descended below the symbolic bar from 105 yens, having reached some levels next to which brought about the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar quoted to around 120 yens and the Euro more than 160 yens.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms to exports of the archipelago, since it increases in price the Made products in Japan and abroad reduces the value of the income obtained by the Japanese companies when they turn them to the national currency.
“Japan is fighting to reconstruct itself” after the seism and the tsunami of the 11 of March, that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), emphasized Noda, that it fears that the increase of the yen cuts by root the weak recovery.
The third world-wide economic power has recovered the growth in the third trimester (a 1.5% in relation to the previous trimester), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase of exports and the consumption of the homes affected by the catastrophe.
But Prime minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the “economic bases of Japan”.
The Minister of Finances, Azumi June, has asked to the Bank of Japan (Boxwood), that inaugurated Tuesday a meeting of two days of its Advice of monetary policy, that adopts all the measures possible to debilitate the yen.
Nevertheless, the Governing associate of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Boxwood already had taken “the suitable measures”, giving to understand that Wednesday would not have to be expected a greater monetary flexibility.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased in five trillions of yens (47,000 million Euros) its purchases of Letters of the Treasure, taking to the 55 trillions of yens (519,000 million Euros) the threshold of the bottoms that dedicates to the acquisition of diverse financial titles to flood the liquidity market.
Zone of the Euro:
the types grow, the bags weaken
The risk of contagion of the crisis of the debt continues harming the European indices.
In spite of the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as of some better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the types of the debilitated countries more continue increasing.
Still worried about the stability of the stability of the zone of the Euro, the European bags sink a little more in the negative zone Tuesday 15 of November.
In Paris, to the 10 hours, CAC 40 loses a 1.4% and it is placed to 3,064 points.
The Dax loses in Frankfurt a 0.4% and London a 0.1%.
“Considering the new tensions in relation to the yields of the loans of the States of the zone of the Euro more affected, the stock markets worldwide continue reporting of their recent gains”.
“The investors, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the contagion risk”, he explains Terry Pratt, institutional runner in IG Markets, mentioned by Reuters agency.
Stock-market of Tokyo has closed with a 0.7% fall, renewing the preoccupations of the inspectors of the market in relation to the capacity of Europe to contain the crisis of the debt.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has the fixed glance in Europe and the interchanges will continue being realized in a margin of variations reduced, so that the investors will not have tests that the situation has become stabilized”, considers Mitsushige Akino, manager of bottoms in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of the preoccupations by the future of the zone of the Euro affects to the unique currency, that continues lowering Tuesday.
The Euro follows in its lower level for a month and a half.
Towards the 10 hours, the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, there is lost value after the party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, that met Monday in the Congress, adopted a motion that it anticipates, in particular, the option which a country in difficulties left the zone of the Euro without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types surpass 6% fully
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain to some very worrisome levels.
Tuesday in the morning, the yield of the Italian obligations to 10 years reached 6.85%, whereas the Spanish titles to the same term offered a 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates of the countries of the south, although also of France, continue feeding the fears on the inspectors.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, that runs the risk of asphyxiating itself with the weight of its debt.
New Greek Prime minister Lucas Papademos, on the other hand has affirmed that the application of the decisions made in the Summit of the zone of the Euro the 27 of October would be the “main work” of its Government.
Spain is in the front sight of the markets, whereas Sunday the legislative elections are celebrated there.
The difference of the types (“spread”) enters the obligations 10 years Germany and Spain, has reached a new historical maximum.
In the hope of the numbers of growth of the zone of the Euro
From the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third trimester, that is to say, a number more favorable than anticipated 0.3%, impelled by the domestic consumption.
The Insee, nevertheless, has reviewed to the loss the number of the second trimester, with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth trimester is the one that really worries to the economists.
Germany, on the other hand, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
One anticipates the first forecasts for the set of the zone of the Euro to the 11 hours, after the European Commission has warned on the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must merit more than the dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be tried simply having in account considerations of short term or thinking about the emotions, she is the energy policy.
The availability and the cost of the electricity influence directly in the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is suitable that an electoral encounter is the moment for reflecting on such questions and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it studies the set of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the propose options.
The French must base their opinion on facts objectives, in rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people in the planet, the demographic evolution will suppose the duplication of the electrical demand before 2050, unless it is deprived to an enormous part of the world-wide population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of the fossil resources continuously to continue producing electricity, without forgetting the urgent necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions to fight against the climate change, a subject that has disappeared of the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.
For that reason, Germany remains single in its decision to resign to nuclear energy.
That is not the case nor of Belgium, that it puts under hers the necessity to find a source able to replace it, nor of Switzerland, that it only has by objective to construct power stations of last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to mention some examples, follow ahead with determination with their projects.
The United States, by their side, after Fukushima decided to add to a unit to their park, retaking the construction of an interrupted power station after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on the renewable energies, appears sometimes like example, the reality goes against such speech.
The election of Berlin is going to suppose an increase of the price of the electricity, a greater dependancy energetics by the increased necessity of imported gas, in particular of Russia, an increase of the CO2 emissions by the construction of coal and gas power stations.
In some months, the detrimental effects will notice.
It must meditate on the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the Aeolian sector, from which he obtains 30% of his electricity, also is one of the great gas and coal users due to the intermitencia of the wind\; therefore, their CO2 emissions and the price of their electricity are, respectively, a 65% and an elevated 50% more than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the certainty of our energy policy, our neighbors pay to an electricity invoice a 40% superior to the one of the French homes.
Whereas in a global economy the cost of the energy constitutes a key factor of the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity of Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would suppose a strong ascent of the price of the electricity, which would reduce realism to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
One is a price that the great majority of the French refuses to pay and, in fact, as a matter of principle do not indicate opposition to that type of energy, according to show the surveys.
We remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to construct to an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect uses.
Widely oriented to export, it includes a galaxy of SMEs specialized in the international markets and that can create nondeslocalizables jobs.
If France decided to leave nuclear energy, it would suppose the sacrifice of great part of that SME and the loss of the 6,000 million annual Euros in French exports of equipment and nuclear services.
What electrician would order a designed EPR to work sixty years, when the landslide of its manufacturer is predicted?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it is necessary to admit that a miraculous source of electricity production does not exist, like a diabolic source does not exist either.
The development on the part of Areva of solutions with CO2 low emissions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary character of the energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of security.
In France, we have an Authority of security that exerts a strict control and is transparent as much on the existing power stations as on the construction of Flamanville.
Our equipment, of recognized professionalism, also is obsessed by the security.
In the middle century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the one of Three Mile Island, took place in some normal operative conditions\; it brought about consequences neither for the people nor for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to some and reactor design unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural catastrophes of a reach without precedents, that brought about the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn of this accident, as it both did it of previous.
Thanks to these progresses and to a cooperation between the security authorities, and the French operators and constructors and German, the EPR presents a design able to resist to such phenomena.
While all the electrical actors study it who wish to construct a power station, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them via free assuming the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It turns out indispensable and legitimate to look for the best options energetics for our country, but he would be irresponsible to leave emotion it, the dogmas and the partisanas maneuvers dominated a so important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, does one load or an opportunity for the economy?
The policy of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting off from diverse points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services submissive the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed statute of “country of the human rights” of France.
More recently, the one is the harassment administrative of the foreign students that has jumped to the holders, with the Minister of Interior (it see the Libération newspaper of the 23 of May) proclaiming of passed that France “does not need foreign talents, working nor waitresses”.
Nevertheless, rarely it is analyzed from the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is consensus between the left and the right enough.
To the case of the right, Jacques Chirac determined the direction declaring in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed ones would not have to be a problem for a country that counts on near two million working immigrants”, whereas to the left, the tone fixed it Michel Rocard explaining who France “cannot become position of all the misery of the world” in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, as much the left as the right shared the fear to the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
To both sides, it is considered that the immigrants are a load for the French economy and the society.
The only difference is in the generosity degree with which they act with respect to the immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande limits itself to include trivialities, indicating that the codevelopment will allow to solve the “problem of the migration”.
Perhaps this idea of immigration like a load, a problem, is profitable electoral, but economically it leaves very expensive.
As they indicate the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May of 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 partido populars.), exists an ample consensus between the specialistic ones on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth, the wages and the use in the countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of immigration debilitates the growth and harms to the use.
The fears related to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace the national workers, in particular to the little qualified ones, pressing so that their wages are reduced.
But the experience demonstrates that, in fact, the immigrants are rather complementary who substitutes of the national workers and mainly exert professions in sectors with lack of use.
The little qualified immigrants work in sectors that they do not attract the national and most qualified workers in dynamic sectors where the formation does not satisfy the demand of personnel.
A positive effect on the wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country that has lack of anesthetists, the complementariness between nationals and immigrants causes that the arrival of these last ones positively influences in the wages and the use of the nationals.
Considering the previous thing, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of the migratory flows supposes an ascent of the real wages in the long term among 0.6 and a 0.9%.
And, without considering the fact that the diversity that contributes the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (a great proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes exists and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The immigrants are also net contributors to the social systems, since they contribute of average a 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The International Labor Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will realize a net contribution (income less expenses) of 150,000 Euros to the budgets public of average during all their life.
At the beginning of its mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to look for the growth points that it needed “with the teeth”.
These teeth, that dissuaded the immigrants, had the inverse effect exactly.
Europe she invented the democracy, only needs to think about an European democracy
The democracy is a good precious, but also fragile.
The European continent would have to be able to remember it since, although it was invented in Athens does more than two thousand years, throughout century XX has undergone the tragedies of the World war, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Perhaps some thought that, so that the democracy prevailed definitively on its enemies, it would be sufficient to exert the vote and of the possible most direct way.
We know, from Napoleón “the Small one”, that was something thought.
The universal suffrage, although is a necessary condition for the democracy, is not sufficient by itself and it even can become a “instrument of oppression”, as republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said formerly.
No, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis that we lived in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is on the verge of becoming a political and democratic crisis.
The palinode of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the necessity of a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrisome sensation of his impossibility, its incongruity.
It must be reflected on this ambivalence to surpass it.
The truth is that the lines of battle of the democratic battle at the moment are had displaced and that, in many cases, the republican soldiers no longer advance in the good sense.
We will not leave winning if we demanded a succession of national referendums, organized based on the needs and of disorderly form.
A signature in target to absolute the European monarch or a stop to the emptiness of the nationalistic hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to remove to blows from effect, but a common exercise, ipso jure, calm and continuous, of the options and the democracy, this time on European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because only there is a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The totality of Europe is the one that is folded to the orders of the markets and the agencies of qualification, that the one that suffers its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
The one is the set of Europe that undergoes a humiliation in the international sphere.
We worried about the transference from sovereignty to Europe, but the one is all Europe that loses the sovereignty slowly and, with her, each of its nations.
Most urgent it is than the popular sovereignty reclaims the rudder of the European project.
Because only together the European will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, to be freed of the markets and to prepare their future by means of the investments.
The exit of the crisis will require decisions on European scale that will not be able to be taken without total a democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
After to have fought during long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everybody requests an European economic governance at present.
That thus it is.
But to think about her without a greater political and democratic integration, and without it is lived like so by the citizens, would be the new madness and it would take us to a new deadlock.
We must assume a new stage of the European construction.
In order to construct the Republic in France, it was precise “to make” republican.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be sufficient.
This lesson continues being applicable.
We must construct an integrated Europe from the economic point of view.
It will only be possible to be obtained constructing a more democratic Europe in the political plane, a true European popular sovereignty.
In order to construct Europe, we make European.
The cards with chip “without contact” become general
The world-wide hall chip cards begins Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, year 2011 would have to finalize with an increase of 11% in the world-wide card sales with microprocessors (banking cards, telephones with cards SIM, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations of the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is the one of the technology without contact, that allows to simply pay to the transport common or the purchases approaching the card a reader.
This year 460 million cards with chip without contact will be sold anywhere in the world, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its quota would have to continue increasing in 2012 (it anticipates 580 million units) and to represent near a 10% of the world-wide market of cards with chip (6.925 million cards).
Europe, that has been long time left behind with respect to the region of Asia-Pacific, is taking terrain in the sector of the payment without contact.
Around 26 million banking cards Visa already has this function, that it is accepted in 75.000 terminals of payment.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards are being used Visa without contact.
But the great surfaces work by four.
Carrefour has emitted this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
In order to put the march superior, however, it is necessary that the banks put them at the disposal of their clients.
“There are two great French establishments that are had it jeopardize to spread systematically in the future, between its clients, banking cards equipped with the system without contact”, it announces Gérard Nébouy, general director of Visa Europe France.
The banks prove the payment by mobile phone
But it only constitutes one first stage towards means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, few devices equipped with technology NFC exist (Near Field Communication), indispensable to realize the transactions.
“They are falling behind”.
“But it would have to finally undergo a true height next year”.
“We anticipate that they will be sold anywhere in the world between 80 and 120 million units in 2012”, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the advantage.
The Crédit bank agricole announced yesterday the launching of a test between December and the next June in They fall.
They will equip the iPhone of around 200 clients and collaborator with a cover that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société also generates to him has affirmed yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of a supply that allows its clients to pay without contact through its mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front increases
Paris worries about the bonds between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The bonds between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it was suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian Vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even affirmed that Algiers already “has the certainty”.
“The way in which both organizations operate and the information of the intelligence services demonstrates that they are cooperating”, it explained, without contributing more details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the kidnapping of two French in Niger the past January would have resumed the footbridges.
Kidnaped in a restaurant of Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory they died on the following day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation sent by the French special forces.
In the rubbish of the intervention, telephone the French and Nigerian investigators discovered several Chips that they belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the realised calls indicates towards several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers caught especially the interest of the investigators: one leads a Nigerian who remained during long time in Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, supposedly, is near Aqmi and the sect.
“One is a progress, but without a doubt we must hope to own more formal tests before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram”.
“But it is possible”.
“We know for years that the sect enjoys financial support and intellectual outside and that every time she is more active”, it affirms Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
These last months, these “supports” had been more and more evident in the evolution and the speeches from Boko Haram or in its operative ways, that now imply the use of kamikazes or more and more complex explosive devices and of the same style that the used ones by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning by Washington, is since then pressing to Abuya so that it considers the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take to time whereas clause to the group like a community of illuminated little worthy of interest.
A fast success
Founded on 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and to the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (that means, in hausa, “the western education is a sin”), urges the restoration of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a fast success.
A strict respect of the sharia is politicized and demanded, whereas their militants send themselves to the fight against the ungodly central government.
These last ones are oriented in the first place to the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were especially active and the attacks against the police stations multiplied.
The reaction of Abuya was, as usually it happens, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead was registered.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while still alive, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect radicalizes and leaves its own grounds of the north.
Past Christmases, it vindicates an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram returns to attack against Abuya, in particular against the protected headquarters of the police, with a suicidal attack, first of this type.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations become its international immediate goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, that would include from Mauretania to Somalia happening through Nigeria, troubles all the specialists of the security.
Whereas Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somali of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram arises as a new threat in center from the continent.
The week last, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned to him against Boko Haram and has affirmed that he was arranged “to share all the information”.
The world according to the republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry competes in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America debilitated by the crisis, it can manage a complex world with ideas simple or, even, simplistic?
Listening the republican candidates for the presidential ones, the voters could think that thus he is.
For some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates every time make more uproarious declarations and short cuts in the matter of foreign policy, traditionally a strength of the republicans.
The mottos extend, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate better located in the race towards the designation by the “Grand Old Party”, he has threatened taking to the Chinese before the WTO and denouncing to them “by manipulation of his currency”, a key subject in a America exasperated by the whole fragment migration of his sector towards Asia.
It gives equal if that implies the explosion of a trade war, affirmed.
Jon Huntsman, old Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate whom a sophisticated vision of the foreign policy owns, almost suffocate before an attitude that “squashes” the emotions.
It has requested a firm, but constructive dialog, with Beijing (the present position of Obama).
Pero Huntsman, that remains suspended in the depths of the soundings, continues being inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney also has promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions do not manage to interrupt their nuclear program.
“If I leave chosen, I will stop to Iran”, it bragged.
“If Obama leaves reelected, they will have the pump”.
It also promised to increase the military aid to Israel, blaming Obama to have failed with his obligations in relation to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second candidate better classified, shows on the other hand a shameful ignorance of such subjects.
Recently, it insisted to resist apparently to the Chinese military threat because Beijing “tries to develop nuclear capability”, ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom from 1964.
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports to Israel and wants to take part in Iran, says that, on the other hand, he is arranged to unfold the American army in Mexico to fight against the cartels of the drug.
The resource to the torture against the terrorist assumptions, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann praise it.
The differences are considerable with the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the present President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that won the Cold War.
They remember that own Obama was a fan and who had to relax the piston in the matter of fight against the terrorism.
They insist, with reason, in the failure of his ingenuous dialog with Iran, in the hasty exit of “boys” of Iraq and in its distortions in Libya, and they label it of weak.
But the attacks are not to them simple.
The population judges of a rather positive way the balance of national security of Obama, who ended Bin Laden.
From Iraq, it distrusts of the military interventions that generate a collapse.
And, arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The Nord Stream, new front door of the Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, that western Europe with Russia communicates directly happening through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put in good condition.
It must provide gas to satisfy the needs with thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian giant of the gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
The past Tuesdays, more than 500 guests, including four Government and Chiefs of State, participated to borders of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and delicate bufet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime minister François Fillon and his homologous one of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the Russian gas entrance in the network of western Europe.
With this new gas pipeline, every year 27.5 million additional cubic meters will arrive from Russian gas at western Europe through a first one had of 1,224 km that communicate the region of Saint Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania.
A second tube would have to conclude at the end of 2012 that will allow to provide a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is to say, sufficient to cover all the French consumption.
In addition, already it is spoken of the possibility of constructing a third tube by the same route.
For Gazprom, the conclusion in time of this enormous work presents victory airs.
Poland and the Baltic countries had been against firmly to the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream is going to allow to provide to gas directly to Germany, avoiding the terrestrial course by third parties countries (Poland and the Ukraine).
Of blow, these two countries lose something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence in Russia threatening closing it to him the access to the markets of western Europe.
In the algid point of the debate, Warsaw did not doubt in comparing the Nord Stream like a “new pact German-Soviet”, with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say, if the subject is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained a greater security of provision.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy, since the project has generated a breach between the European of the east and the west.
Russia has known, in only five years, to make prevail its vision over a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, great consumers of gas and with some reserves more and more limited.
“This gas pipeline constitutes a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites to us of organic form”, François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the great contracts of the sector of the gas are so politicians as economic.
All this explains the ample smiles in the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, the destination of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline also supposes a technical profit.
The submarine tube is made of covered cement steel to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
One leans at heart of the sea, to an average of 200 ms of depth.
In order to construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields that date from World War II.
“It was necessary to retire or to destroy a hundred of them, by precaution”, it indicates Jens Müller, spokesman of the society Nord Stream.
Also, it was necessary to carry far the measures of protection of the fauna and the flora.
The tube is one long metal serpent that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and are not interrupted in all their length: neither by valves, nor by service stations.
A platform of control in waters of Sweden was predicted, but the people in charge of the project resigned to the same when seeing that the Swedish were very not prepared to allow that a Russian state society settled down permanently in the sea against its coasts.
“In case of failure, we will less than interrupt the passage of the gas in a minute”, precise Jens Müller.
In case of flight, the gas of the gas pipeline will be freed, therefore, to the atmosphere.
But the constructors consider probable little that a flight takes place, since they have anticipated junctions that, according to the forecasts, will be a flight every 100,000 years old.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by means of a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, that inspection realizes outer, as well as by means of a device that circulates around the interior of the gas pipeline.
With the form of a pure one, it is introduced inside the tube, that owns a diameter of a meter, and it moves with the gas.
To its arrival, after three full working days of trip at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to work during fifty years without needing no type of repair.
The gas circulation is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the outset bars is of 200 and, when coming out of 100 bars.
Five companies have united their forces to be able to take to end this project.
The company leader is Gazprom, that owns 51% of participation.
To her, Germans E.ON and BASF were united (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five societies have created a company common, call Nord Stream, ordered to construct and to operate the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition is especially favorable.
Later, Gazprom rented to this society, during a renewable term of twenty-five years, the totality of the cargo capacities of gas.
“To Gazprom it will pay to him by the total capacity, independent of the amount of gas that really transport”, precise Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has taken I finish in a 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in a 70% by means of bank loans.
The total cost of the work would have to both reach 7,400 million Euros after tubes.
After GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that they will not surpass his investment, since Gazprom by itself assumes the risk of the expenses.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, in a planted sandy coast of pines.
Some valves, with 4.5 meters of height, form the door of exit of the gas.
Some sensorial exist that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific features of the gas to the arrival, before German transfers itself to the gas pipelines.
From the past Tuesday, the terminal hourly receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas.
To total capacity, they will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a notebook name brand.
Created for half a century by an Italian company, Moleskine has been wanting to give back to people the taste by the writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is clear easily, with his you graze rectangular blacks, its rubber, its leaves of broken white color, like aged by the time.
Nevertheless, the Moleskine notebooks with the present aspect were born… in 1997.
The Italian company Way Way, cradle in Milan, at that time decided to send to the market a design note notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time consulting of the company, was in charge of the launching of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by one old production technique, the mass skin (awkward person skin), that talks about to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the sidewalks.
This notebook type was very evaluated by the writers and the travellers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old object and forgotten, an icon of the cutting edge artists until century XX”, counts Maria Sebregondi, that since then Way became person in charge of the brand in Way.
And it achieveed the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased in a 26%, until reaching a volume of 12.7 million sold units.
Far it has been the confidential production of the first years, in which 3,000 notebooks were only designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the note notebook attracts so much businessmen as to students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, their users are cosmopolitan, of open spirit and cultured.
The Italian small business, that had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns near 100 and, from 2008, it has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the retail stores of, and has known to impose its identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the necessity to write, in spite of the height of the e-mails”, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes of the hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has sent the exhibition “Detour” where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, it also sent a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Festival of cinema of Locarno.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural dawn, Moleskine has known to diversify its products: purses, agendas, ball-point pens, covers of computer… The brand includes an ample range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in autumn of 2006, Way Way was acquired by the Capital investment fund SG Europe, at present Capital Syntegra, being written therefore a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the rate of unemployment of the disabled workers continue so being elevated?
Around 19% of the disabled people they are looking for a use.
XV the Week for the use of the disabled ones begins today.
In spite of a resolute public policy, applied from 2005, the rate of unemployment between the disabled people duplicate the average rate: a 19%, against 9% for the set of the population.
Discouraging?
“Not”, it affirms Eric Blanchet, general director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the use of the disabled ones.
“The progresses reached for fifteen years are considerable.
“At that time, the rate of unemployment was not twice but three times more elevated than the average.
“Nevertheless, still it is very many to do”.
It is possible to mention that unemployed the disabled ones continue facing numerous obstacles to accede to the use.
Usually they have an age outpost: 37% have more than 50 years (a 17% of average).
They own a level of qualification little elevated: 80% have not finished the baccalaureate and, of the 2.3 million students in the education superior, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very extended among them: 53% for the disabled ones, against 38% of average.
That is to say, numerous questions exist that make difficult especially the return to the labor world and which “they constitute the crux of the problem”, it indicates Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the companies to engage disabled workers.
Those are the obstacles objectives.
In addition, those exist that are not mentioned\; the mentality of people advances, but too much slowly.
A study realised in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for Cité indicated that the survey directors have “a level of knowledge on the incapacities low”, with a “excessive representation of the people in wheelchair, deficient physicists or intellectuals”.
The result: private enterprises with more than 20 workers are very far from the objective to contract a 6% of disabled workers, objective that paid attention to a law of… 1987.
According to the last numbers available, that date from 2008, they reach a relation of 2.6%.
“Now we reached around 3%”, it indicates Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the organism in charge to collect the contributions of the companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment “submissive this contribution”, like the disbursed quantities, are handicapped between 2007 and 2011, happening of 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and of 606 to 480 million Euros).
“The 2005 law, that increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for the companies”, explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, in particular between the great groups”.
According to the Ministry of Work, only 59% of the societies that they own between working 20 and 49 account with disabled employees in his group, against 82% of the companies among 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: “A joy”
On the verge of at night facing the Bleus Tuesday (20h45), Eden Hazard and the Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that generates this friendly party to them.
We will not dare to say that collusion among them noticed, but the image is symbolic.
Seated one next to the other, in the stand of the audience of the Stade de France, the Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really they have made peaces.
Five months after the gesture of resentment of his forward against Turkey, the selector Belgian does not have praises for him more.
“I was glad much for Eden, by its progresses and because it is Belgian”.
“I want to advance”, responds the forward to him of Lille.
As far as the resistance between its presentations in its equipment and the selection, “it is a set”, has been justified.
“In Lille, I am all the year, which is not applied to Belgium.
“I must locate to me”.
Summoned to play against Romania Friday at night, considering this party against France, Hazard it comes to Saint-Denis for, finally, “to shine”.
Without forgetting to us the “pleasure”.
It takes animating to the Bleus since it was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been its fan”, it affirms.
Without a doubt, that is going to especially reinforce “the particular” character of the encounter.
Especially because one will face “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rummy)”, it remembers.
“We finished facing recently.
“To play against them always it is a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has made on the other hand reference to the “pride”.
“Pride” to dispute “a party in full dress”.
“Pride” also to verify, like “neighbor”, who France “returns to be an equipment of very high level”, near a year after the traumatism of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable work”, he said warmly.
Whereas Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be enchanted of being able to share airplane with the Bleus towards… Brazil, in 2014.
“Our small Belgians are growing”, it emphasized.
“We are constructing something\; the players are ambitious, are hungry.
“They will be able to see it in the next parties”. Including the party against France.
Portugal shows much confidence
Portugal de Paulo Bento faces a great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22h00), that will be celebrated Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the away game, they needed realism to both teams.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy equipment and, mainly, a happy country”.
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and the Ukraine.
It does not have any doubt\; the Selecçao, that directs from September of 2010, is going to qualify itself for the Eurocopa of 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate to Portugal of the happiness.
But there is a party that to play and a rival, Bosnia, that to defeat.
Considering the away game (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems evident that the thing is not determined.
Portugal dominated the party for more than one hour, yes, but it could not mark the valuable goal that had given the tranquility him.
“It is a good result, but simultaneously it entails a risk, since we have not marked abroad”.
But at home, in luminous Stage of Light of Lisbon, Portuguese is convinced that they will happen, before public that would have to be equal of excited, even if is evident that the party “is very even”, dixit an optimistic but shone Bento.
“We hoped that the party is very even, but completely are convinced that we can take the advantage”, declared the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
“We continued having a 50% of possibilities of participating in Eurocopa 2012”, it has, however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The tie of Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and to win.
At the Bosnians a tie could arrive them, although they also have necessity to mark.
“It is a good result, but simultaneously it entails a risk, since we have not marked abroad”, it laments Bento.
“We are going to play against an equipment that owns a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality”, it added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention to exert, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians for “not letting time to think to them”.
A good idea, whenever, this time, is realistic.
