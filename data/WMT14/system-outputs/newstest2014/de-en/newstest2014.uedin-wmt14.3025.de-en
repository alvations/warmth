Schools are encouraged to greater focus on math, spelling and grammar
In courses in English literature, pupils must at least a play by Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyricism and contemporary British novels from 1914 to deal with in the future.
The audit also "combat texts" are to encourage broader reading too.
The combined rate of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils need a separate GCSEs examination of language, with strong incentives for English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education, tomorrow will publish the new curriculum for English and maths - the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative Ofqual, the exams regulator, a reorganization of GCSEs announce structures, including a new tracking system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer of Education Minister Michael Gove, that there is a broad consensus that we will need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, "he stressed, which would be" more challenging GCSEs, ambitious and strict, "said.
Studies show that less time will be spent on mathematics in English schools - 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year - than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore will receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time in the curriculum for maths, but from coalition circles, it means the extensive math test, combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings - will probably encourage schools to have more hours.
In the curriculum more emphasis on "problems in real life," including financial mathematics.

In the course of my employment in these facilities, I have been witness to systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me from a moral obligation to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself, I faced a serious and persistent smear campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation in accordance with international law grants to me.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
People around the world, and even senior officials - including the United States - have the revelations of mass surveillance to a system that is answerable to, as judged a service to the public.
The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives that the previously concealed abuse of the public trust.
The benefit to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks taken in buying were visibly reduced.
Although the result was demonstrably positive about my efforts, my government dissent, still as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression and put on trial.
Nevertheless, to the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community will take this damaging attitude.
I hope that I will be the humanitarian situation if the problems are resolved, the ability to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts about the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country, once the situation is resolved and I thank you for their efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.

Through the mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend to treat almost every weekend, hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people
Here you agree or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle Heroes of 2013 is among the top 10 of the "CNN."
You can do for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 vote to elect him to the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner receives $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
In 1981 Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had a broken arm, but then an inflammation that extended to his brain and caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle years spent to accompany his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and will not, however.
There are very many patients.
Indeed, some people die, because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem we have is," poverty, Bwelle says.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father, and so many of his compatriots are suffering caused to mature in Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team held 700 free operations last year.
He was even a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCO Vime, which travels at weekends in rural areas and free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
He almost every Friday and up to 30 people force in minibuses and drive up to the medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need the help.
Not always everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: A feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offer medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot.
In the evening, the team simple operations with local anesthetic performs.
The operations typically take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient to stand and walk in the recreation area to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the operation and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteer work until the early hours on Sunday.
It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help, motivated to keep the team.
"They drum all night, so we stay awake and able to continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team moves back into the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroon foreign doctors and medical students - 700 last year has carried out free operations and know that they are with their work makes an enormous difference to the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a work that he had received to work him now and again.
"It changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
This second job, he is financed by 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he sleeps," Katie O'Malley, who studied in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntarily participate in Bwelles group says.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," says O'Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon usually bring themselves and often donated medical equipment.
But they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is very" undoubtedly a hero, O'Malley said.
He has devoted his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no borders.
Bwelle for the almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to a more fortunate life, and to fulfill a promise he made to his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to alleviate the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis new cardinals will call on 22 February, for the first time, the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The Cardinals senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who are choosing a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately be involved in the choice of his successor.
Currently, there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the election - this is a group of 120 "electorate Cardinals."
In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals will be held, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision on the holding of by in February in advance so that other meetings that require the attendance of Cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He said that a pope normally take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of eligible cardinals measured over 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
Currently, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to redress the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis to find a group of eight Cardinals from around the world who have a mandate to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
"Now that Francis has selected eight cardinals that will help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis ask the Cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically recruited from great places to Cardinals, but Francis "was full of surprises, we do not know whom he appoints."

Europe's elite prepared to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and to define what those who care in Britain for prosperity and work to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, the roughly the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries which modernize and grow, while the states are languishing in the EU.
You wish that the government of new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured, rather than the long and arduous process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.
Asked about their views on specific legal issues, from antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders, believes that the control of this key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as the cost of the Brussels rules, according to the companies would now outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to this, which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This finding, which can be found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change," which brings the tiller back to Britain.
It is about much - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead at 16 percent to change its mind to stay in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of Britain's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as the results of our survey shows what companies will mean a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.

Supreme Court upholds Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court ruled today that the closely linked with Barack Obama health law is constitutional.
With five votes to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to complete a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty - within the framework of the tax authority of the state is constitutionally.
The chief judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judges decided Warren, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 page law and also took the view that the imposition of the health law that states either the entry requirements for Medicaid would have to expand or otherwise all state Medicaid funding would be removed, was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election campaign in 2012.

At present, more safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 yards away from each other, on Tuesday in Gutach is the new B 33-pedestrian traffic light on the village park has been put into operation, within sight of the old town hall lights.
Two plants so close together: Intention or folly?
Has answered that question Gutachs mayor yesterday.
"The town hall lights have been installed at the time because it ensures the school," said Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-lights safe both cyclists and Busfahrgäste and Bergle-dwellers.
The official yesterday in operation system is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / fair.
We have the museum, two churches, gardens, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank and the traffic flow from the residential area "Grub ‹.
"With the high traffic and foot gear up another traffic lights to come to their safety," said Eckert.
This Peter Arnold the Offenburg also confirms.
"According to current measurements, the community through the B 33 at about 12 000 vehicles a day, of which about 10 percent are" heavy traffic, Arnold said.
Therefore, the construction of a new traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simple," says Arnold.
A total of four road shows have been carried out, including a roundabout was considered, but rejected because of tightness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / fair.
It has been tested, according to Arnold in the site selection of the traffic light poles before everything: "With an extra for us with very long wooden trunks loaded vehicle, we have equipped te, whether these vehicles from Sulzbachweg onto B 33, umzuknicken without the traffic light poles."
About 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the "state of the art, which is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that illuminate so strongly that the lights are visible from the drivers, for example, even with deep outsider sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
Each direction, there are three lighting systems.
Arnold said the technique of the new plant, which is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian presses the button lights, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
The road is free, there is an immediate green for pedestrians, if it doesn't, about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be stopped for the pedestrian.
"A group of people were to go on the road, the green phase will be extended, it is everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, "a luxury car - in bright red.

By air ambulance from North Sea oil rig saving birds released again
An air ambulance to the coast geflogener bird who sleep on a sea-oil rig had been found, was back in the countryside.
Last month, the Wasserralle was flown in a helicopter to Aberdeen, where she was nursed by the Scottish SPCA animal protection organization in their rescue centre near Alloa.

Drug tunnels discovered with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, has now discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres be tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, linking warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses, which makes it easier to hide with drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel has been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities said.
The discovery of the tunnel eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine have been seized, according to the records of the court.
Three men who worked as a driver, according to the authorities, have been charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You prison sentences of between 10 years and life threatening a guilty verdict.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of Entwässungskanälen.
The tunnel, the eighth major passage, which was discovered in 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels have been following the marijuana-harvest in central Mexico in October found that the drug cartels, the challenge is how quickly their product to the consumer.

Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government thinks extended measures in the framework of a "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457-visa.
The test should be introduced, he came across a criterion used to prevent the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or used as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, the government has been discussing a proposal published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, the comments of the government in terms of foreign workers had condemned because it from Australia's neighbors could be perceived as an insult.
"Strident statements like that foreigners should stand behind" and stop Australian first "is a very unpleasant relapse at a time when unions demanded a protected job market," she said the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected, and if some people in the area heard an echo of this historical artifact would not surprise me.
The debate proposal outlines 12 measures that were once considered by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday to talk about people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has converted five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity" criterion is accepted, then someone who will be applying for a visa, examined the effect could be whether the request is real in cases where the applicant is the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring company spent or personally connected. "
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457-visa holders, as in the past, only a small number of workers wanted to support, and hundreds have stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-lankischer Asylant presumably of a heart attack after he this week with a refugee boat has arrived at Christmas Island.
The stunning nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia, is being cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday from an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man in the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian town with giant reflect light
With huge mirrors the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their gloomy valley.
Because of the low level of sun sinks the case in the Vestfjord Valley, Rjukan from autumn to spring, usually in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors in 45 metres a year hundred dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" Mayor Steinar Bergland swarmed at the launch ceremony in the broadcaster TV2.
Some people from their advanced sun chairs, others put on sunglasses as a precaution.
So far, the sun worshippers had to travel in the winter with a cable car to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to steer the beams with mirrors into the valley.
This idea, however, there were already in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the council had finally passed the 5 million kroner (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar design provides for several years, the Italian Alpenort Viganella wintry sunshine.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of justice and home affairs.
To this end, the working group met in the morning in Berlin.
Among other things, it is a matter of direct democracy, corruption and the federal police.
In the morning, the working group migration and integration wanted to continue their deliberations.
It should go, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants the compulsion for German-born children of immigrants to choose to end - the union rejected a double pass.
On the subject of transport, this Friday is not on the agenda, the SPD has underpinned their "no" to one of the CSU required car toll.
A vignette is a "flat rate for a drive and thus environmentally counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the issue, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened escape traffic on roads that are already black spots.
The introduction of a toll for all cars from Pronolds also would be only a first step.
"There is a danger that the compensation will be removed at a later date for Germans," he said.
Glitzy do disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested in land.
They spread the coal from the ships coming to the dump.
The company has at the site several irons in the fire.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard, among other things, on wind farms logistics.
Black coal shines on the storage space in front of the dam.
Two enormous blue Haldenschütt- and distribute chargers or loading the coal demand here.
With every movement of handling equipment, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals are security and are" legally prescribed, Matthias Schrell, managing director of Midgard tracts in Wilhelmshaven says.
When the unfavourable wind, unfortunately, that is widely heard - and there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He take complaints very seriously and have therefore been in contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now trying to keep the warning signs with technical measures quieter.
In the future, he put on the open dialogue with its neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has done before at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the import of coal for power plants and is one of the big players in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the intensified bath to 18.5 meters from terminal can also Cape-size bulk carrier will be processed here.
"This year, we want to cover the 3-million-ton mark crack," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon-power plant on the ground is the import coal to power plants in the interior of the country.
If the GDF-Suez plant to the grid, are good import 5 million tons of coal per year.
The three ships discharge on the bridge, and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is" in good hands, Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier said.
The former kindergarten in the garden road, the municipality has sold to a private individual.
The sale of the council agreed in his recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier said.
In the budget of 100 000 euros were scheduled.
Still not clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winter for the responsibility of the building has handed over to someone else before winter and therefore no longer pay for the entertainment of the house, such as photo to look to the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone, Maier is happy.
Halloween 2013: In
When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, grew late and clad in the neighborhood.
Today, I am more for the Halloween rings.
In the last two years, I have said I am not prepared to distribute sweets from my apartment, and it will probably not do this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep on Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, giving it a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers pulling.
One thing that I am every Halloween then again, are the trend values.
The costumes are approximately 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, the principal.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are the rage.
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
When it comes to men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that speaking about Daft Punk-punk space men will this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the most wanted costumes.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We have our dogs dressed last year, and to my surprise, were not alone.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, the principal.
That is a lot of "Hot Dogs."
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
This year, Americans will spend $1.9 billion, as The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, Lutschern, candies and Gummi.
That is good news for the US Department of Commerce 41 million people with the slogan "or sour" through the quarters.
In fact, we will buy about 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not delude ourselves - to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; however, 15 million kilograms of which will be sold for Halloween, the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
That is about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I could not solve.
Nothing is more on Halloween than houses where there are haunting.
You have great names like "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised haunted houses in the United States, which will reach $500 million revenue, as America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photographs of National straight into the pants and friends on Facebook, where you get rid of them, and then the guy that you leave a comment like "nice facial expression."
But we come to the tariff mouthful.
Charlie Brown made us with the Great pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like the jewellery of the Christmas tree - something that we have made.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend began only last year thanks to Pinte rest, so most of us have grown up with it, the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year were harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you want to score correctly, please call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and teaching you convert their 921-pound pumpkin.
Pimps to prison
Because exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily injury, the District Court of Konstanz, a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
Former German army soldier who worked after two operations in Afghanistan as a bouncer, was in the context of a consultation process a confession.
Therefore, he has met in five cases of women over the Internet or telephone contacts that he sent after a few weeks on the line against their will.
Opposition he used to break with violence and threats.
The revenue of the women who bought partly for him for years, he maintained.
By confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards from a band of women he contacts with the outside world.
Along with a colleague who gave the women, he brought them into different brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them to police to control their revenues.
In court, the defendants initially claimed that he suffers from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had come next to him, died in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert grave doubts about the mental restriction and thus in a limited debt capacity indicated, the 33-year-old made a full confession.
The court had to hear none of the injured women.
As a Criminal Investigation Division-official reported, after a first display by telephone surveillance measures at least four more cases of ausbeuterischem human trafficking.
The intercepted conversations were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later questioning the victims would have confirmed their ordeal.
Another witness, one of the women had discovered bruises all over the body, made no statement to date.
"This is a completely broken personality" who see violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He had solved these circles and wanted to" after the arrest of a normal life, "he said.
Tripodi disputes to have been influenced by Obeid
The former minister from the Labor Party, Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation by the government corruption in sight.
The former NSW Minister denies that the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid to have changed, the covert investments in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC ­ Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday on the question of whether Obeid influenced several government ministers to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe to extend without tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now, are being investigated on the accusation, Tripodi knew of the Obeids concealed interest in the land after former deputy team leader Tripodis Lynne Ashpole had testified on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases were extended for the companies at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had originally called for public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as confirmed Tripodi, pushed for an overhaul of the lease arrangements of the government.
One of the ICAC's telephone transcript showed talks from the August and September 2007 between Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved into the port ministry after he had worked under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"The issue under discussion in these phone calls was the development of the commercial leasing arrangements?" Asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection and terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he should be the roof of the U.S. outpost photograph, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antenna and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, was again in September, saying that the United States is no possibilities of foreign espionage, "the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to steal their international competitiveness and could increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, a former employee of the whistleblowers, with the publication of his filling Horn of U.S. surveillance secrets, are European governments and corporate executives no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company and American data cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo has acquired, the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.
The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was verwanzt, possibly for the last 10 years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, business lines are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Green, president of the BITMi, small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States is now almost as great a risk as China when it was about industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU certain IT and Internet facilities were missing and they reduce their dependence on the United States.
The companies are sceptical.
The Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can close my eyes and open them slowly....
"So it works, Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software maker SAP said.
If you have a strong European IT industry would have wanted, then you would have them 20 years ago to extinction.
Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Yet reach and technical sophistication of the Snowden leaks revealed US spy agencies shocked firms that previously the biggest espionage risk had seen in China.
The cloud computing will be a big change, because European business leaders are now aware that stored data in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction and therefore are potentially at risk.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, rejected poll after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the non-members residing in the United States plans to use an American company.
Jim Snabe, deputy chief executive of SAP, said: "We see a new issue of customers that there was not yet a year ago - it is: Where is my data will be stored and you can guarantee that they are physically in this area of law?"
Many German business leaders argue that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states must want to steal their most valuable secrets, and they are therefore guarded at any price.
The fact that economic espionage, is no surprise.
It has always been this way.
"It was an issue for many years and has" by the current discussion not fundamentally changed, Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF said.
The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do this, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The company does not normally on the action we have taken, which affords attackers benefits.
Employees in large companies have long eingebläut that the export of a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unguarded left a laptop in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at automaker Audi, said that it was standard practice for years, before a board meeting to collect the phones, so that they cannot be used as a luxury.
The German BAT advises executives, simple prepaid phones to use when they go on foreign trips, possibly because smartphones can be compromised.
The prepaid phones will be thrown away.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to protect company secrets effectively against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.
The US company warn against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel behind China filed in two of the countries that used for the procurement of economic data of the Hackings.
A member of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
When the horse experts in droves in Cardiff, brought together in order to select the horse of the year, they were aware that a rat race before.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who is not even in kindergarten, and only a few months ago, made his first steps, and his Shetland pony-toffee trotted only loosely through three rounds and got the first prize, while 30 adult opponents left behind.
The 16 pairs, both of the same size, have been praised for their appearance, attitude and style at the annual competition, which is being organized by the Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee by the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had Toffees last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
You had to compete against the entire field of participants and have gone with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like hooked and all have cheered him and geklatscht."
He ran on sand, the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares.
Just as he started, it will not be long before he is on the "horse of the Year" shows - and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows what he has to deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The jury considered Fenton and toffee how well they fared well in the Vorführring would have presented.
Pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader - and Fenton and Toffees were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part, that really perfectly suited to the occasion.
Pflegetag at the small English cottage
Meanwhile, the fifth Pflegetag in the succession of the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald met a group of dedicated participants in the small English cottage in Ibach.

The tourist destination of foresight, according to Tribukait coincides with the aim to preserve the now widely ranging old Allmendweidfeld with its specific types of protected area of life by opening and connection to the existing pastures.
Some species, such as rare butterflies and grasshopper can barriers in the form of forest not overcome.
You need the free connections to conservation.
Tribukait said she wanted to fail at this point is not for the planned biosphere area to strike a blow.
This plan, the current measure put not only seamlessly.
A biosphere area also offers the chance to sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status, and thus a continuous extension of the Life Project and the previous day to care for the future.
According to these different versions shared area director Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Sarah Bischoff aid workers in groups.
The larger trees have already been beaten in advance, the Forestry tractor stand if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a Trockensteinriegels.
The goal was clear view at the viewpoint.

Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman's health
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions of the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars are linked to the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government should not waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package, which, in our view, the unique challenges faced by the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election results.
By further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for eye cataracts, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic employees have told me that they are the best way to improve the health care system," Tasmanian Tanya Plibersek said.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state needs to maintain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, 325 million dollars of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system of the state of the list of worries," Wilkie said.
According to the state government this election services are largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that the announcement today is only a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are therefore in the current situation, because the lab-state government 430 million dollars, has withdrawn from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not acceptable that a state government is nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth sticks 300 million and then do so when it is good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that a single dollar of the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.
In protest against the proposed wealth tax, the French football is actually through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting is nowhere.
The dispute over the wealth tax, the government and the pro-football in France after a failed arbitration hit a dead end.
President François Hollande received on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris club and association representatives and heard their complaints.
But he refused, the football from the planned 75% levy on incomes of more than one million euros per year, all companies in the country for two years from 2014 to pay to spare.
The other side remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November, will now also be through, said the chief association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel,.
Between November 29 and December 2 scheduled game days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the protestant parish Bisingen.
Theme of the day in the parish house "proverbs from the Bible" and "phrases from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the churches or community, went down after breakfast in a speech to the biblical proverbs.
"Proverbs contain life skills, rules or warnings," she explained.
They compared several proverbs with the Bible and explained the importance.
She called sayings such as: Wood is vigilant eye, as falling from the eyes, cast an eye on someone's own people is the Lord during sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
The speaker made several times their listeners also advise the saying it was.
The phrases from the Middle Ages adopted the Kirchengemeinderätin Christel stretcher: All good things come in threes, blue, something perished.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called "bridge to the past."
Finally, a raffle was raffled off.
The prices were covered on a table and were described as humorous, before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round mayoral candidate novel Waizenegger interfered.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god viewfinder, a meta-physicist, his novels and stories have something serial.
The astounding kinship abroad: The sharp eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as M. Fyodor Dostoyevsky's understanding with its massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist for the Russian soul, you read Philip K. collection as an American prophet who is something in their own country.
Some titles are published on publishing, the Lagoon Mans-cassette with 118 stories sells two thousand one.
Dick America - the realm of the breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had religious experiences, his later books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, drugs had his brain.
It is understood that the machines are Divinitäten early.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator of his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner 'problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
Now this story is particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and McCarthyism tribunals.
It is the principle of "pre-crime" developed "Pre-Crime," so what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dicks world that resembles our own terrifying mutants look to the future, and the police.
"We collect individuals who have violated no law," says the head of the agency.
"We grab them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society, there is no serious criminals, we have a penal warehouse full of Pesudoverbrecher." Read time flows.
You assume that bad things happen, and that the criminal idea is put into practice prevent.
Dick story acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA Abhörrausch.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone-work philosophy and practice.
But Dick story is not over.
The police chief complains that there is no separation of powers, the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the state.
Then the monitor is monitored and transformed itself of a future crime.
The system.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents his own conditions.
Errors and victims does not only, but builds itself.
The system creates the risk that fights it.
Philip K. Dick read, again to come closer to the truth.
Court blocks decision to Stop-and-Frisk directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department had requested, and the judge absolving them from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city is decided.
The judge had ruled in August, the city was violating the constitution with the way the program will be implemented for stopping and questioning of people.
The city filed an appeal against their assessment and ordered remedial measures, the decision to set up an observatory, including who should support the police in changing its directive and the appropriate training program.
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday the required suspension.
The report said that the judge should be released from the case, as the code of conduct for American judges have violated, is determined that a judge the appearance of partiality to avoid; this was partly with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program targeted.
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body worn cameras in areas where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who have been made redundant after an inspection by the police.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk-tactic by a number of civil rights advocates criticized.
There is this kind of controls for decades in various forms, but most of them increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the partyless Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, black and Latin American men.
In 2004, was submitted by four men, all of whom were members of minorities, claim that developed into a class action.
Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk Program of the NYPD said that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way, like other police chiefs are using the scheme.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime wasted; neither would money and the broader problem of a police solved that stand after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure.
The judge pointed out that the stop-and-Frisk practice not finish that is constitutionally, but only the kind of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD reforms.
Anger over the verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come in the 2002 bombing in Bali killed over the verdict reacted angrily to the last of the instigators, which has been brought to justice, because Umar Patek, in their view, should be shot.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.
With punitive suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict also took place in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it is referred to the man who "because of his reputation as a master bomb-maker known as" Demolition Man, asking for the death penalty could have.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, which has lost its 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years of devastation.
Fighting with tears, she said, should be sentenced to death had Patek.
I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I will have no further grandchildren, and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club has been razed to the ground when a powerful bomb exploded on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m. in a small truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds left before a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek have earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before any other.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
For 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber, who was in court.
He cheated nearly a decade of the arrest, but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, picked up where US forces less than four months later, the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden killed.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan, in order to meet bin Laden with the aim of the link between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaida to rebuild.
"He has not asked, Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the way he has a great deal of suffering to other people.
The ruling was issued before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"This year, there will be many tears," said Corteen.
Patek may object to his judgment or appeal.

Traffic lights on Dauerrot: Listening to wait
Sometimes, a traffic light turns green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light signal is broken.
What are we to do - go in red?
The affected has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, can he continue, the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker says in the magazine "motorcycle."
But the wait should be "reasonable," which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advised to stay at least five minutes before it could be from a malfunction of the traffic lights.
If you continue the trip despite light, however, should be aware that he is responsible for an accident caused by the full blame.
Those who are less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, Becker cautions and points to a decision of the High Court of Hamm.
In the case of a driver had negotiated answer after about three minutes Dauerrot ignored the traffic light and a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was broken, but jumped to green.
A driving ban was spared him because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
Profits at Bombardier to decline in numbers and supply contracts
The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15-percent decline in net profit, due to declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail division under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, released a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information as to whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft, one and a half months, only three more starts, what it is calling the testing phase is proceeding as planned so far followed.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" "performance sector" in view of the fact that the stock has over the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential.
"Although weaker sales figures were expected on planes, but the margins of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program is progressing on the plane.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sceptical towards the program.
Bombardier hopes that the series of the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.
But so far, binding orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft are correct.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jets.
The company said on Thursday with analysts and media, the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer than expected, remained on the ground," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates have been scheduled.
Each manufacturer is planning.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, what we have done.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it said corporate side.
However, analysts remain skeptical that the first customer to 12 months after its maiden flight, take a CSeries aircraft in operation.
Bombardier said it checked the planning of the operation (EIS), and will update them in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously BOMBARDIERS internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015, Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end on 30 September BOMBARDIERS net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of EUR 4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 airplanes to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, and was unchanged from December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were" disappointing, Beaudoin said.
Turnover in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion at September 30, and has increased to 31 December.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday announced the Bombardier-share by 8.5 percent and stood at 4,83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and BOMBARDIERS closest rival, on Thursday reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit.
Rules on electronic devices on planes will remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian airline passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change its rules so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight e-books to read, watch videos or play unless they are in the "flight mode.
While the bulk of the flight's passengers already permitted, but many people find it annoying that the landing at the start and not read their e-books.
Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines need to do a lot of work, but have no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air safety authority CASA also said that we will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic devices on the plane," was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines must always maintain the safety of the passengers and the crew's safety instructions.
Virgin has already with CASA talks on an extension of its use Wi-Fi-entertainment system on flights and said that he is open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that it would improve the customer experience, after we now offer" (wireless entertainment) during the flight, a spokesman said.
Qantas said that they will remain until further notice in the current regulations.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices during takeoff and landing should not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, which can benefit passengers, and the FAA decision and the reasons behind it certainly exactly.
The decision affects of US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
You have to prove that their planes, the radio interference from mobile devices can tolerate, and manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs as well as customers instruction.
"After the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level allow," gave the FAA.
In rare cases, where visibility, the crew will instruct passengers during the landing to disable the devices.
The group also recommended to pack heavier devices during takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the lockers.

Revolutionary work of the church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year history, the songs wreath Dunn (two church services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert festive air.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life," the enthusiastic spectators in the spring of this year, the songs wreath at the end of the jubilee year will enrich two religious services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe of Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary show from 19 during the evening Mass at the Church of St. Martinus and on Sunday, October 27, will be heard at 10.15 a.m. at the Mass in St. John Baptist Church in varnishes village.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "chants to celebrate the sacred victim of the fair," D 872 is a spiritual music works of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was seen at the time of the birth almost as a revolutionary.
The show will be performed in the context of the religious services, as the principal John Phillip Neumann had it in mind.
Under the leadership of Herman Schneider, the choir of the brass section of the Musikverein gladness Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi is accompanied on the organ.
Scientists have been able to throw more light on the context in which the tail is the equivalent of a dog with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while nervous dogs was the left side.
But now scientists that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and respond to say.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans is well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli, which cause positive or negative emotions."
Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that dogs, like humans, the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs on the side focused their brethren respond, the researchers monitored the animals, these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moved in one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail to the left or right."
If the animals looked like an otherwise-dog expression has moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the fronds of dog from seen), they remained completely relaxed.
But the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog's leash), their heart rate rose and they looked nervous.
In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara dogs deliberately do not communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience that they should be worried about movements and when they are not.
He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs and the swish is associated with the tail in one direction with a friendly attitude and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you can act on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert said on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether on the left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, said the following: "Dogs to go more to a robot dog, though, tail leash" on the left and the right not to be restless, rather than the other way around, as in the Italian study. "
According to his testimony, the differences could stir, therefore, that the dogs in the various studies interpreted the animals in the movies or the robot dogs, not as a dog.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.
"While there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Since their behavior can be easily record, however, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one, sometimes in the other direction.
Tony Blair said that he would use the opportunity to return as a British prime minister - but concedes that a comeback is unlikely.

Pawnshops are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the shopping centre in Singapore Bendemeer Janani Amir (Inga trades a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings, in order to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, because all my money involved," says Amir (Inga.
Although they each month 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1.730 euros) as an administrative worker deserves and her husband also work to submit the monthly family income, she explained.
In fact, the demand is in parts of Southeast Asia, where the debt of households is growing - so large that ValueMax where they made their exchange, this week was the third pawn shop, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The transfer of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amir (Inga - but also almost as cheaply as an unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops typically demand in Singapore, an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is only just above the 15.4 percent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no review of credit or income statements are needed here, and loans are faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region to pawnshops after families are feeling the pressure of rising living costs and growing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose monetary policy in developed economies to look for families with low and middle incomes pawnshops to offset the difference as at stotternder economy.
This week described the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by rising mortgage, as a risk factor for the credit worthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency, have the highest household debt relative to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia, with 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also worry because of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged this week just from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, that people will try in the face of rising costs in the middle and lower end of the income scale () to supplement their income, wherever possible," Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank says.
Historic highs in gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the trend for pledging personal items, as people use the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family in cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledge items in the 200 pawn shops in the city-state of gold.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let us pledge Grandmother's gold chain and return next month."
Thailand's largest pawn shop operators, easy money, in its stores, has a 20% growth seen in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operators of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 other wants to expand in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company that finances with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen due to high interest rates in the crossfire, Yeah, pawnshops does not only lower interest rates than other lenders, but not directly increased the debt.
"Customers finance items that they already have, and that personal valuables stamped magnified the budget-training," she explains.
The mortgage lending is increasingly socially accepted as a short-term, secured funding.
Not all the people who use pawn shop, are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come into the branches of ValueMax, gold bars and Rolex watches to pledge what they are up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social class.
"This includes wealthy, something in the short term for a business or an investment lending, or small businesses, the bottlenecks in the cash flow to bridge," said Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.

Living with future
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.
Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an ancient trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"Hopefully, you have no fear of spiders?" Asked Waltraud Ries and points to a big spider on the door frame.
I am looking for me for some time now, a new home for my husband.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern to the age of the many steps to the house and no longer face in the apartment, she says.
Moreover, since a Meniskus operation has Mitt fifty woman in the flesh, have to know what it means to handicap from floor to floor.
Recently a book of her appeared on the theme of "Seattle live in old age - What home form is the best for me? '.
"Our home is the best example of what is not in old age, it begins to tell.
After more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment.
Fifty Today with mid-Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
They also know that it is one of the few people who have to deal with the theme of "living in old age.
Most of the crowd out there, as long as it is.
The others are only ever, 'she says enduring.
Only when the suffering is really big, you do think.
"Then it can be too late, so Ries.
In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
"The residential form you choose an individual decision, however, is always, 'she says.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the age retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany, should consider that he could also be ill.
And: "Without a good knowledge of the language of one club late in the Dolce Vita," the author is willing to consider relocation.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of living and the often-quoted pensioners.
In old age, everyone has his tics and quirks
"For me, it would be a residential community, but nothing," she says with a wink.
Certainly not as a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"At the age you need his retreat, Ries.
The fact that a senior-living community can work, however, the author does not rule out, however.
But then it should be different than in the traditional student-WG.
And sometimes you just want to even his calm, she believes.
With this view, at least, it is not alone in the capital.
"Most of the old people in Stuttgart want as long as they stay in their own homes, the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service is life in the age of the provincial capital.
The department advises people around the theme of 'ageing'.
Therefore, especially elderly people would often take inconvenience and restrictions, just to be able to stay in their familiar environment, which has also been testing the experience of the foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends to instruct all who deal with age just rebuilding their house or apartment to check it thoroughly and not only the best craftsmen.
Today, there are also the age just reconstruction specialists.
Even in the apartment that one or two can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase the interior designer to clarify.
But the existing housing is not always appropriate for their age and transform this barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.
Indeed, one could install a stairlift within the apartment, the paved road with stairs to the apartment door, however, would be a much bigger obstacle.
They will continue to search until they found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, we dread her more than before the spider on her apartment door.

Cocaine addict lawyer, warned the drug boss before police investigation must go to prison
Preferring Basharat, 42, gave information to under world size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer had come to fear that his secret drug addiction could light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defense lawyers, who warned of a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid that could be revealed his secret drug addiction, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Preferring Basharat, 42, supplied by world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The Kriminalisten as a "premium" vaunted lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched as Scarborough (32), three bags of cocaine at the house of a lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while Cooper, with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association.
The investigation brought to light that prefer regularly consume the class A drugs, after traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards were found in tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure Heroin- and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They, along with 32 other people were arrested later, after police ensured in a series of house searches heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Preferences, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized.
Today, preferred, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice for convicted and sentenced.
He admitted in a previous survey of the cocaine possession.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough, that it had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with preferring.
Two investigators from followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove into the dustbin of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough was regularly with preferring, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home clinched the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that preference was a "regular" consumer of cocaine after the class A drugs were discovered in tests in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
Preference was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because it was his client, and claimed that their discussion, "lawyer secret."
During his arrest, preferred took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated, both under his home address and an office in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal issues.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else, breaking the law."
Preference is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender, because he has too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He resisting the police investigation as much as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr preferring brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that its independence has been compromised.
Preferred rejected any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I wanted to be a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and pass information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lee Halstead superintendent of police in Lancashire, said: "Mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and the motives made him susceptible to leading members of organized crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers need to maintain the highest standards of integrity and the public trust and confidence.
Preference has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious Crime Unit and arrangement of Lancashire, preferring headed the investigation that led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared the conspiracy to Heroin-, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Further fünfunddreißig drug operators' people have been sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website preferences published a range of questions and answers about where he said he was his dream job is to represent clients as a lawyer on death row in America, Mohammed Ali, was his ultimate guest at the dinner and inequality is the motivation for his work.

Council takes track facilities targeted
The railway crossing "On the deer" elaborate to be converted to increase the safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to next year's Kinzigtal line.
In particular, the security at railway crossings should be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The communities agree to the restructuring measures, they must with a third of the cost, with the rest divided and federal.
Schiltachs city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs "On the deer."
There, the city plans to build in the amount of the tunnel mouth west of the railroad tracks a bulge.
There are also larger vehicles could, for example, to those who transport logs, standing at oncoming traffic, blocking the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a retaining wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the appropriate time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been discussed in the council controversial, as some councils, the need for a road expansion in doubt: Thomas Kipp said in his statement, the mood of the critics: "We must because so few vehicles have so much money?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "deer" will be used regularly for long wood shipments.
Even the wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route, in part, because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could use the route along the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that do not use the tunnel, if the road is blocked, Haas argued.
It is conceivable that church mountain and Schlossberg tunnel and need to be cleaned up, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "On" deer "for an extended period, an important traffic.
The council agreed to investigate what costs would cause the expansion of the street.
Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway crossing the majority agreed with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall will be built in such a way that the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" if necessary to meet the city traffic could increase to around 5.5 meters.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein could draw against a different problem, which is access to the strong growth "Geroltzhäuser way."
The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, because they had doubts as to whether the planned end of Geroltzhäuser route is possible even without further ado.
The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the tendency of road conditions could lead to longer vehicles do.
The responsibility for this, in turn, carrying the city as a road last winner.
The change could therefore take liability disputes.
Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development work to support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision of the train is here with a vehicle on the transition are significantly lower than in the other railroad crossings, because the mid-point is right next to it, which is a good visual contact.
Even the terms should be spirals at this juncture that no collision threatened.
The approval was largely the reconstruction of the railway crossing refused because the city Schiltach "the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles" would have to pay for, the councils, as the railway could after completing the construction of the responsibility.
In 2006, the panel considers the changes of the railway crossings "Before the village" and "Before Kuhbach" that have already been made arrangements with the railway junction.
Alexei Miller, Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new Gasära
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria put the start of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, said the Gazprom board.
"Today's event is a milestone: The construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have started," said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to ensure greater diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, providing an increased risk in conventional routes, officials said.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates if the project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work will begin in other countries downstream on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

Places through an appeal against sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney in Phuket has been sentenced to 15 days in prison, because they had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Bamford Rochelle was first found by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, guilty of having made a false statement after she had indicated the Thai police, a local taxi driver told them in the early hours on Sunday, June 10, raped, while two other men clung to them.
Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that they had arrived safely in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket Bamford interrogated for two days, until she confessed to have invented the story.
Before the trial, she was on the ground in police custody.
Bamford was a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre stage on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, to the foreign ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted them back in Australia.
"We are very concerned, of course, but we hope it is as soon as possible at home," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht at large.
In Australian reports said that it makes in the meantime in the tourist resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the part of the court was to hear Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to impose a sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could, after the recent assassination of travel purchase wife Michelle Smith in Phuket have tried to improve its tarnished image of tourism, and it is therefore an acquittal.
The using builders fences painted on the Bechtle-plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" is using builders fences on the Bechtle-land along the promenade in Bad industrial embellished.
Moreover, they cleared and broadened the footpath, it said in a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house at the rear of the property had been allowed for security reasons, because the site is in danger of falling.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had denied the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI had been affixed a banner with the message "We are in favour."
That's about 20 members of the citizens' initiative, however, little disturbed in their action.
Their motto on a large poster said "We are against Bauruinen.
They wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "site," it became clear that some people believe that it will go with the implementation of the project in the city of many better, though not a few have the same questions to the scale of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is delaying these answers on states, the BI.
As they say, the public statements of the mayor's work.
May said the City Council meeting that he feared the death of the thermal baths, the population of the citizens to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex voting on the Swiss meadow.
That is why some people seem downright scared, others see it as a "crude blackmail attempt" to the population, goes on to say in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and Gitftgasmunition, the global monitoring group on Thursday declared chemical weapons, while in the north of the country clashed near one of the sites, which allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people since the start of the civil war were killed, almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline on
November 1, which the organization based in The Hague Damascus had set to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or "who" mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling of ammunition, including all machines.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can produce no new chemical weapons.
Damascus, still needs to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates in the country, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the town of Safira took place on Thursday, experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, such as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which has a network of activists in Syria, the number of deaths, said on Thursday, 120.296 people have died.
This 61.067 were civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the government side were 29.954 by the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 are pro-government fighters and 187-Lebanese Hezbollah militia.
Also among the dead, many of them are 2.202 served army soldiers and 5.375 fighters of the opposition, foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated the number of people killed in the conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, which many connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that there had been on Thursday losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the risk that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to liberate Syria's toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a brutal civil war.
According to the meeting, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen all of Syria 'major production and mixing / filling equipment and experienced its destruction. "
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checks and 21 of 23 of the sites visited by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two bodies was impossible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC explained that the two sites had been abandoned, according to Syrian statement... "and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other indicated bodies that have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions, which the OPCW inspectors could not attend.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, the next month by the Executive Committee of the OPWC must be approved.
"I salute the bravery and the courage that you all have shown while fulfilling the most challenging mission that has been ever carried out by this organization," Ahmed Uzumcu, the director-general of the monitoring organization in a comment published by OPCW said.
For three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in a civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which includes many members of the Alawites, a secession of Shia Islam.
In other developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is a further indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly accelerating.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, where daily 5.3 trillion US dollars an ounce.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff in the widening investigation has been suspended by the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigations are continuing on this issue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS the records of e-mails and instant messages, and have been sent to a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, have passed.
The dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now at its current position as a European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan Beyazid did.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, Beyazid did this week and Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The instant message group of Usher were bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that they have taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA had declared that they examine the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market on a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority WeKo, the FCA, the US Justice Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with allegations that bankers in transactions in the currency market should have denied.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations, the dealers in a field in turmoil, which in recent years has become one of the most profitable of the trading units has heard from investment banks, but this year under pressure because of low volatility in currency limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid currency market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads that "one with very low ticket prices can affect the market."
The news came on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced that it had this week, a dealer of the London exchange traded funds-offices terminated after he at the end of last year, a loss of nearly six million dollars had caused.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is working with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is under control," said Credit Suisse.
Coulson was phone-hacking for checking a tip a
The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly "phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in the attempt, a false tip about an affair of the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey, the News of the World listened in May 2005, a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack voicemails Pawlbys, and pursued them, but they also Coulson called and left messages, the court heard.
"According to the public prosecutor Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to monitor them, but one, faced with a history of people like to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW use three procedures in order to investigate citizen stories: Phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows of the second, the surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone-hacking?
He denies that, but we say: "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair were Clarke's first feature by the editors of NotW picked up as a source who was sexually interested to Pawlby, said: "You don't waste your time, together with Charles."
A band with voice mail from their phone on at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective to Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
At a time when the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they received for information, they were asked, Edis said.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk with Charles."
Edis explained, coul's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important figures, including the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett due to an affair with a married woman have faced when he himself was romantically involved with the co Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Brooks and Coulson deny having events conspired with others, between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006 to hack the phones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
Early puberty: Grow up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones and other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger of the early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist based on children's health and family issues.
A mother should be concerned when breasts and pubic hair grow their daughter already at the age of seven or eight years ago?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - usually, this is not a sign of puberty happens quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, formerly show girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than visual in 1970.
"If the development of breasts starts, it will take" at least two to three years until the Menarche, Kaplowitz, author of the book "early puberty in girls said: The Essential Guide to deal with this commoner problem."
The most accurate test is how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is ready for "early" if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a spurt of growth before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process has slowed down or stalled - something that can monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress tests could be indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumor or cyst can be ruled out.
There are treatments for the delay of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "That suppress puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age to be."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want that their very young daughters have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or about how they handle" the hygienic side, Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock, a woman whose daughter has received with ten remembers their days.
Although there have been signs, and we talked about menstruation, they were not emotionally prepared.
She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in her group of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages were found in the media.
Young boys are like girls before puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country of African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age.
There are various explanations for this.
Global appears to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions, the climate and genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow the face and pubic hair before the trend towards a comprehensive early puberty is not as high as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey said.
Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their pediatrician, how they should talk with their child.
"It may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child is usually good.
Girls who are flowering early, need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.

It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
To hear the fans were mostly with their voices.
By contrast, the southern grandstand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans, presented himself very quietly: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of Capo, who coordinates the collective spirit, remained unfilled.
And on the grandstand blew lonely with a large banner reading "section stadium ban."
Just as goalkeeper Roman pastures Feller, as always, was the first BVB player entered the square, two short-lived jubilation.
When his team mates followed, there were loud singing and floating scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand nothing stirred.
Even that stadium spokesman Norbert naval position unconnected again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - made no mood for celebration.
Only five minutes before the start of the Capo climbed his podium - and the almost tangible tension overflowed with hands in a loud cry when naval position unconnected restaurant had, as usual, the mood in the stands at the stadium.
Finally, as always, the southern grandstand was in the series - and finally was here again, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And no later than kick from the southern grandstand vocal call "Derby winner is" came out, everything was back as ever.
The silence before a reaction to the events of the past few days was good.
Just before behind expectations at FC Schalke 04 had some of the mitgereisten BVB supporters flares into the grandstand and fired on the spot - and almost goalkeeper Roman pastures Feller.
The game was delayed starting whistle because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-boss Hans-Joachim Watzke, the Dortmund Ultras had subsequently received in his office - and believes one Watzkes words, it was a rather uncomfortable for the Fanvertreter date.

Otherwise, Watzke, the BVB will decide by the end of next week, a sanction.
"That will be" drastically, Watzke assured.
It will be interesting to see how the reactions are on the south grandstand.
What happens on the road with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually electronic letter.
Was in the drafting of the Internet service, e-mail like the traditional post technically the correspondence implemented?
In the design of the early Internet services stood in the foreground, making communication.
That is why we have the basic technical protocols did not pay attention to create a solid foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence.
Therefore, is a traditional e-mail a postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" to "Benni" sends an e-mail, the host of the two are directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser by Anna sent in the first step of the mail to the mail server of their service provider.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, would be the Google.
This mail server sends the content of the provider, Benny.
On the track, the Mail can run on a number of other servers on the Internet.
Groundwork can call the content in their provider.
Traditional e-mails are on their way through the net read?
Most of the messages are on the road several times by software robots.
The provider of the sender will be reviewed in the rule whether the mail is a malicious program as an annex.
The receiver systems will also be a virus-check.
Also, check the provider, whether it is a tiresome and unwanted spam email, which immediately deleted, or at least in a spam folder wegsortiert.
The robots have yet another task?
When the robot systems such as Gmail determines the information that Google for placing context-advertising needs.
When Anna and Benny communicate about their next holiday travel via Gmail, Google may display relevant links to leave.
Also unknown people read the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons co-reading an e-mail, is extremely low.
In theory, but it is possible.
In companies often administrators have the option of Attacks electronic mail.
The law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the legal ability to intercept e-mails or to recognise.
There are possible illegal Ausspäh-actions.
Is it possible to e-mails to protect against thereby?
With an encryption after the OpenPGP standard is an e-mail effectively against thereby be encrypted.
With high technical effort, it is also possible that the metadata of an e-mail communication to hide, so that not even without further ado, who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
The main private mailboxes used Yahoo and Google play, according to a study of Convios Consulting in August 2013, only a minor role.
While the shares of Yahoo mail last fall, Google's Gmail could significantly.
Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive to promote the work of the pastor.
The background is a possible priest shortage: Divine country church Hanover expects that the number of their current 1,800 pastor and pastors to present situation by 2030.
For young people of today, the work is very attractive and offer good prospects, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the press service.
It is attractive to determine the work and daily routine itself.
With the country Burfien church has commissioned a pastor for the first time at a full point to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people decide after graduating to study theology.
This leads Burfien back on the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is" out loud.
The work of great freedom and diversity is shaped.
I am Mr my calendar and I can put my focus there, where it is important to me.
Pastor pastors could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly, more will be paid in the free economy, but would have a secure employer theologians.
This brings me to the young people of today, it is not just about career, but a meaningful work.
According to the national church, which includes three-quarters in Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are now a year into retirement.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology student start their Order.
In sparsely populated regions such as the resin - or the Wendland could be difficult in the future to fill vacancies.
Among other things, have Burfien wants to hold study days for young people and also invite celebrities who studied theology.
The studies offer a broad education.
You can even be President.
Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord charged with sex offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were for sexual offences relating to children has been charged before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.
But, at the opening statement before the commission of the YMCA stated that we have had to do "in the organization never with an incident of sexual child abuse."
CEO Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted.
Hare Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistance, a lawyer said that he had known of the first case, the second known but did not.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also vague on the claim that "there was external reviews of the YMCA, where the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront in terms of child safety."
Evidence before the commission that the YMCA has been informed that he had received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of this year show.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged that the company had "from me downwards" in the recruitment of Lord failed and failed to ensure that employees have been aware of their obligations to report violations of the regulations on the safety of children.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences against 12 boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees have held them to report violations of Lords regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she privately as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, leaving one said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned for his behavior, said that the children's services director Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, "and most of the time was very remote."
The director said that he would not accept statements by officials that they had not had the courage to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord have affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said that he had the board of the YMCA NSW shared his view that the lesson that the organization from the "Jonathan-Lord-incident" to consider, "not reporting" by staff concerns, and the Board have agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations, shortly after the allegations were made by the director of the YMCA of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said the contamination of the evidence should be avoided, but what had been overzealous "and" poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no organization safe for children, Professor Stephen small bone from Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, said the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At around 120 metres a sewage canal is below Cologne received from the Roman era.
Visiting Cologne, arrived at the cathedral.
Some 157 yards, the two towers soar into the sky, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who visit the two ornate spires, suggests that there are also under the cathedral to discover a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his leadership is the service center of Cologne tourism in front of the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and that is why it remained from the remains of the ancient city wall only, which was not too big.
Most users of the Park House pass rush so today the Roman ruins and park their car.
But if you look closely, discovered in the parking deck D2 a metal iron bars separated archaeological site.
To see about five meters high ruins of large stones.
"There are remains of the Roman wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze will throw the participants on the upper level nor a glimpse into a dark, 15-metre deep well.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is perceived.
Next stop on the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participants will rise back down into the depths.
We are witnessing the official residence of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the pre-gate of the CCAA.
What does CCAA, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which in English means as much as" City of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor worship "."
And the Pretorian is the former proconsul Palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the lobby of the exhibition, a tunnel leading to the Roman sewer access, which is preserved here at around 120 meters in length.
"You can go quietly along a step along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," encourages guests to Schulze.
A surprise Schulze has.
Having taken the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, walk-shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath," he says.
The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the soil, groundwater, which was essential for the Songkran.
Until now, the tours, whose origins date back to the eighth century are at the lower end, readable different water levels by varying levels of the Rhine.
Mikveh is part of an archaeological area in the town hall square for the construction work will begin soon.
Until the completion of a few years will pass away.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior are racing seats and six-point belts and an overmold.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package of care for Bowler Works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally-customers who come to Bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, and after an achievable path to world-class events.
We are looking forward to this path in partnership with Land Rover and Ma to open and believe that the format opens up new possibilities, the various rally-disciplines in Britain and abroad to experience and newcomers to the rigours and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun, the Defender Challenge-car to develop - this is an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is the Defender Challenge, a training and crash in February, as well as the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots election
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to meet the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along of Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, it was in the communication template pointed to the potential economic benefits that greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe would entail, but it played - as expected - no role in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent to their strict rules, if it is cheaper for them.
As Scotland is not part of the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
So, no story.
And one that has come a long way in the years that they already resembles a fossil: The first time I have the "independence means passport controls" -Ente before at least 40 years.
An interesting point is lost in the constant refrain of this ancient history.
Why should we expect from an independent Scotland, dancing to the tune of Europe?
Why does the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The big, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project is officially died Europe.
Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU is hostile or the euro as a common currency would throw overboard.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party was founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - Edith nearly five million votes in the federal election in September and distribute them effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There was always domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, it turns out, however, as a turning point.
The Berlin and the European Central Bank imposed strict austerity in connection with the straitjacket that the national economy is being forced by adhering to the common currency, many people are of the opinion that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters - and that German politicians would like to keep it that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current Etat- and currency problems a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the prescribed by Brussels "green" energy policies - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All pay fixed the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed by cheap US shale gas into the corner.
As a result, a revolt rolls, particularly in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
However, Paris, Berlin needs no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, giving the ailing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a key by-election, and that the ruling Socialists pointed to three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that they do not want a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What Le Pen with its newly gained popularity is among the white working-class French?
They want the EU elections next year to take an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament to forge.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very well possible - it could be the first time such a block dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, is the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency together on the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more "something like that" Europe of (sovereign) nations that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distances itself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where Scotland remains in all this?
We can decide a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could be in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with others, like-minded countries is not in a federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed cuts made (and won), which the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were to blame.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed upon them from Berlin and Brussels austerity.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now hear from departure to land their electronic devices for reading, activities, games, music and use the image of films, but not with the phone calls, the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
How quickly it would be implemented, drawn by the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines need to prove to the FAA that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew, as well as the rules for the store of the devices, according to the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received by some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines, including Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing the passengers need to disable them again and may not start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines could airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions, allow its passengers to use the devices for takeoff, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi have been converted into greater heights, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline in this regard - will benefit both sides," Glading said.
We are told it honestly sorry to have to deal with this issue as minders.
Nevertheless, remained Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data still banned under three kilometres, the agency explained.
Passengers are urged to enable smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he publicise a jet of American Airlines had to leave because he refused to turn off the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored as an injury risk here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also continue to banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still viewed as a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt transmission towers," Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Democratic senator from Missouri to overtake Japan take the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, the speech that forgets up to one-third of the passengers of the closure of the device or ignored.
The FAA began in 1966, the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers keep FM radios were aware that the latest technology trends.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference represent them nothing.
Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices to be placed under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less phone radiation than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, provide only minimal radiation, if one umblättert.
However, when downloading or sending data transfer values are stronger.
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the use of passenger counts Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officials invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but none could say.
Members of the FAA's advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas also from the passenger Association, National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who favours a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who are now well equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience is not incompatible with the security," Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association said.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7-Star Bonn village.
The spokesman clarifies right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig culling, turbo mast is not a good prerequisite.
Could ham, you get in every supermarket, a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest Jumbo explains the functioning of the company "eagle" in Bonn.
"Germany's favourite ham," such as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair-protection and coat, he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo, too, must first disinfect their hands before he can pick up the microphone.
Jumbo spotted to strengthening in fast food in Waldshut
"Here I am rießigen quantities worked," amazed the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
Culling 16,000 per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli said what matters in terms of quality.
Most of the pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the pH-value of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I am curious to see if their by Roberto Blanco, what will happen," says Jumbo cynical.
Here, the level of private television is presented in its purest form.
But it is worth much anyway.
The viewer sees that the demolition of the culling remains.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally without the bones on the shelf.
The secret of the length of the spice mix with the salt.
Tower of smoke and Rauchfeuerung remind Jumbo visually to a "submarine."
The trick: Fir branches are here in the smoke for the taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham, almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announces the test Verspeisung.
"It is really good," according to the conclusion of the TV stars.
All parties will be able to live with it.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions surprising hosts
With a small squad had the men I TSV Freudenstadt in Schiller-school gym in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Jura.
The Älbler stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
Soon, however, showed that they could, due to old age, compete with the fast action of city dwellers.
With the harsh and placed surcharges the Gönninger extremely simple.
They repeatedly missed by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the net middle course played passports and attacks and were not in the block defense on the spot.
Two high profits from first set clearly pushed the superiority of the delights urbanites in all respects.
In the face of this overwhelming and match-defining performance was the third set a little lax and sluggish to a 3-0 final score (25: 13, 25: 13, 25: 22).
There will be on November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
The B-class stood in the Murgtal hall in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Wholesome and Freudenstadt.
They provided a competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides, caused mainly by the adoption of mistakes and points of gifts, including passports, the precision was sometimes scarce and some critical game scenes of excessive prevented the look for possible point gains.
This performance was a very balanced encounter in the TSV-team of Marcus Blasutto but consistently great physical effort and a cheerful dedication of both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the people early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come into the town hall in order to explain the measures planned to ask questions to express concerns and ideas.
Häußler clear: "The ultimate decisions, the members of the municipal council."
The flooding that hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a crucial event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring village of Stuttgart, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of cultivated land" is the goal, Häußler.
Based on the planning of the protection is in front of a noisy German weather service statistically every 100 years to expected flooding.
The climate change is a 15-percent surcharge.
In expert circles, this is called "HQ 100a climate."
The water, which in 2009 Gechingen had resulted in serious damage, represented a 1,000-year flood.
"There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, around four million euros will be invested in Gechingen, with the community can expect to land shots to the tune of around 70 percent.
But Häußler pointed out that there are promoting only if a master plan will be implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process needs to be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could be started with the implementation.
Among other things, the protection plan that was presented last week in the municipal council members of local measures in the flow of the river valley from the IRM Stammheimer envisages.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns.
Among other things, has been questioned why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms forest and Corbe from hillside home, who introduced the concept, stressed that it needs the cooperation of all measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is required to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.
There was anger in countries bordering the Altorts who suffer even under normal storm rain again under an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different than for flood protection and it should not be mixed.
The community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that two to three-year rain events will be recognized.
The sewers for bigger, would cost millions.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One thing that invites to linger and comfort.
One thing that would make the name for the program.
As Déjà Vu, according to the dictionary is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the sense of having a new situation experienced or seen before.
In the case of the visit of the cafes on Opschlag in the county town of Kleve in sight at the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it is not in the pure Déjà Vu-feeling.
Finally, the cafe with the wonderful name exactly the goal: To make a real stay not only intellectually, but hand firmly and repeatedly.
Precisely because it is fun and simply beautiful.
A look into the inner life on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer on a good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool cafe-style looks like a place to relax.
The team will spoil here with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with various tea or cocktail variants.
This is delicious cakes or individually ranked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made before the opening of the pretty cafes on Opschlag as restaurateurs a name: In Kranenburg, she led the "Art Lounge."
The move to Kleve in Opschlag hope the likeable cafe-lovers more audience.
Last but not least, by the university.
"However, we have no specific target, Daniel Buettner stresses.
Instead, the two young students want to raise as much as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe-lovers.
The friendly owner couple behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in different variations.
Expressofan
Dan Buettner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino-drinking.
"A baguette - that is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events, there's already in the bright cafe.
Rather one.
Because the port festival took place even more outside the cafe - Déjà Vu benefited from it.
But there was also the stripy Natz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's cause.
Perhaps, Daniel Buettner is also not a great fan of event nights: "You can's, not all of the time."
And with an event, I always speak only those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception rather with us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products, which are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is increasingly becoming a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, guests from near and far, and the students for the gastro-mile and the café Déjà Vu itself.

Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders for seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the ones that airlines seek the most, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which is a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US January Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer vying to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and expected at the event from 17 to 21 November record orders.
As the rear part of the plane is fleshed out, especially if it ranks with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" group 406 people in seats in economy class, which is about 17 inches wide and so allow 10 per series.
Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share of blows on technical details through advertisements in the trade press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X, with over 100 orders are expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that showed the start of a new war and donors could display a picture in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and accept the title: "Would you?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more closely than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the face of changed eating habits, the people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry.
The average American Taillenumfang of male in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100,8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the fresh "Jet Set" was slim.
We have, as Airbus, carried out studies that showed that raises an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus on the seat and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how the balance between airlines flight fares and body shape.
The company also explains, according to surveys, the experience in the plane depends on more than the seat width.
"It is really important to give companies flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," the airline cabin expert Kent Craver explained by Boeing.
You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect the sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders, with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, what a profound impact on the export performance of the US or Europe could impact.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing Quet CHT so more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus says.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers could opted for closer arrangement, which go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that, from an economic point of view is the Airbus offer from the threat of the 777-driven," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world passenger jet sellers bear even tape measure, the establishment of the competition after expending.
Even if they extol the convenience, all manufacturers offer but also jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus A350, with 10 seater series, has sold but say none.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and was offered for some Jets wide seats in the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but the wave of 777X-sales could distract.
Veganism is, according to dictionaries the vegetarianism, but differs from that in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers.
Milk, cheese, eggs, alongside the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one might ask, but on closer inspection, the vegan nutrition world through a considerable ingenuity.
"Sandwich spreads are very popular," Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealanders living vegan, in waters it is (almost) everything he needs to live. "I asked my diet in 1997 and was" vegetarians.
At the turn of the next step was then and I was vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial normal leather.
He acknowledged that it is also in other everyday needs no animal products.
First and foremost is his vegan an ethics.
"I don't want that animals have to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of hinterherzutrauern burgers, Rühreiern or rubber bears the vegan, quickly discovered a new products, rose the enthusiasm.
"It is a double bonus, Proctor said today," is actually his vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset. "Back the assumption that blend with the diet, the choice of dining options, Proctor has more on the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to the smoking," Proctor to a settlement.
And a: "Certain tastes are not pin on the animal."
It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.
"You can also produce the same effect in other ways," illustrates the vegan.
At a barbecue Proctor brings, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
He looks at a balanced and varied diet, which is supposed to taste first proper.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that he had not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I am not a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.
"My blood values are well, I let myself often check," says Proctor.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics.
"As animals are fed with animal feed, instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat in the freezer purchases of vitamin B12 share is high," finds Proctor.
For Vegans, there is also the possibility to take the products in the form of tablets.
"My B12-values are in order," he explains.
Wide paths to Proctor, the food supply is not go.
Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I think on the ground.
Only now and I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but as it is" ordinary "finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought.
"In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not sometimes produce better results," Proctor said.
Margarine instead of butter, a bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws.
Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment.
It has dynamic when you boil it together, has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise, however, are as different as the people themselves," Proctor said.
Of course, he was also shown skepticism.
My food tastes you?
"Shall I now feel bad because I drank milk?" - on such issues, we must act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I reject the people do not, I am part of this society," Proctor would end no enclaves.
And more precisely in the everyday world seems to be not so vegan foreign suspect - and the vegan not restricted in everyday life, as commonly believed.
Even fast food is allowed.
There are French fries everywhere!
"Many travel stores offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor said.
In a pizzeria he is avoiding on pasta dishes, or everything just order a pizza without cheese, a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan everything was" much more difficult to make the New Zealanders can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, they point out."
"If enough demands come, they are probably inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim, or the café bird.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one veganes dish on the menu.
Basically, for all are vegan dishes.
Everyone can eat them, so they are precisely the opposite of exclusivity.
"Meat dishes are not exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, the largest proportion of" to make impossible from the outset, Proctor said.
But the shopping vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand, which also contain additives in animal peanuts and its donors, it seems to comply with the ethics to leave with so many hurdles and quickly fall of courage.
Not only so Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients, but the food is also buried detergents.
"Gradually, it developed a scanner and you know the signs and logos to respect" It is sometimes has to do better than small steps or to stumble, "says Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral Remus, which proposes to raise awareness.
Perhaps he can't quite that one of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits.
Bavaria's first defeat won despite optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euro League could diminish the FC Bayern Munich Basketballern the huge optimism.
"No one can forbid us to believe in it, even against the best team in Europe over the last two years," summing Bayern coach Sveti Lav Pesic after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday evening at Fulham ease title Piraeus.
We have sent the message: In Munich basketball exists.
In her first third appearance in Europe's premier class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but in the crucial stages were simply not enough clarified.
The guests first managed the feat, a 15-point gap 13 minutes before closing in a leadership change before Piraeus was turning the game again.
"We are incredibly fought back against the two Euro League champion, but then again careless mistakes made," said Bayern-professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.

New anti-nicotine vaccine could be the pleasure in smoking experiences
Scientists have an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun at the smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime against nicotine addiction.
Before tests on humans further tests are needed, which could still take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can even help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods are available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine-containing antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker no nicotine-high.
In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against a "break" would have taken, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have achieved their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science translational medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said a future vaccine could, for people if he is sure to be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
It is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
"You know that if they begin to smoke it, because of the nicotine vaccine, no more pleasure, and that helps them to give up the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that it still further research is needed.

Egypt's first freely elected president sworn
Mohammed Morsi places the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and took the succession of Hosni Mubarak, who was expelled from office 16 months ago.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi, the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and in an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people, the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its inception in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government had been targeted.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic, so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually bustling streets, the city centre with the southern suburbs.
When the Brotherhood uncharismatisches "spare tire" mocked his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he wanted to express itself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those presented to the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 from the year against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt" is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state, in a blue suit with a red tie clad Morsi told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, where he took the oath of office.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habachtstellung.
The military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
He was on his arrival of hundreds of people in the main auditorium of the university, chanting "The army and the people are welcomed a hand."
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University has developed in the 1970s to a stronghold of Islamist groups of students.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising last year at the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council of the hunted leader from office.
But, with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament, he defers to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer Hubert Wermters history with the male Cäcilia is almost twice as long as those of the tart, where he was formally honored.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colours of his male office on the stage.
Even after 60 years of singing with the now well more than cherished choir still great fun.
Wermter was also active in the club, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his club loyalty, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - as the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a bishop Gebhard Prince signed a letter.
His fellow singers gave him the document of the German Choral Association and an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the ceremony was the 31st autumn festival in familiar tracks: MGV betra, the songs wreath Stetten salt, the singer Baisingen department and the local music club, the fully loaded, each had a colorful mix of various choirs and singing styles, which had about 400 visitors.
The MGV full Mari narrow opened with atmospheric songs like "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, their brothers."
Her honor singer Hubert Wermter they prepared to honor a small serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "state song."
The male betra also classical choir sang songs like "hunter campaign" by Julius Wengert, "far, far away" by Hubert "as well as the folk song" When you go through the valley. "
The songs wreath salt Stetten provided with his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulse choir" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folk way "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Monsanto Gus in foreign countries, the "impulse chorus" while also drew back to foreign languages: "LIBE Ratio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to her program.
The singer department of the Baisinger sports club came with "What a Schwob?" By Hans ein and Robert Papperts "beer song" back into domestic realms where the full Mari-Musikverein provided the musical conclusion.
For children, there was a small side programme - "grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led to a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were well above the lunch.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to up to 100 dollars to demand from passengers who want to stow away on their flight hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda to calculate, even though the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bag under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it charged 25 dollars if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate.
Frontier-spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 introducing to move travelers, in the run-up to the payment.
"We do not want to charge this amount," she said.
Airlines began in 2008 to demand for the first and second checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to evade them, therefore, have plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee was not really trying to make money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which had clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, will not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, under certain circumstances should carry a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley said that the site of Frontier and the self-service check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier only enters into force in the summer, there is an exact date yet.
Passengers often ranting about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines are keen to return to it.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover after years of losses, the cost of air travel.
Most are so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for hand luggage and, later, the giant Air, a low-cost carriers.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit annually bring 50 million US dollars.
Sorensen, who previously held a senior position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, where passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee, the company would face.
"The boarding process was one of the most fluid, which, in my career, I have experienced in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricated."
Frontier spirit is also the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, which would keep all can and will be filled with free coffee.
Water is still free of charge.
Us Airways tried briefly in 2008 to demand for soft drinks, it made money, but reversed seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company.
Frontiers step to charge fees for hand luggage if passengers don't buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on their own website should be directed.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
It provides an incentive for all societies, passengers to buy directly from them rather than moving through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone in this area, however, most.
In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency, only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles have been cut again to 25 percent of the flight.
A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1,000 miles brings customers, therefore, only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book solely with the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking, and the company is losing money.
The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., released.
Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in a tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled Ringer mats in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was on 11 January in an upright set mat found behind the gallery in the school gym.

"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Thesis Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed that he had died just as it had concluded the sheriff.
"They are of the opinion that it lacks any logic, against the laws of physics, as well as against the common sense goes," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be covered up to protect the person or persons who were responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to learning in school and came back in a body bag," he commented.

My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy would interpret the fact that Johnson was on the consequences of a "post-related choking" died.
A second autopsy, however, gave a different cause of death, Moore.
"There are a number of issues that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct the investigation.

John Kerry said in an unprecedented acknowledgement that the US spy is "inappropriate" gone too far
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs by saying that the spy had gone in certain cases inappropriate "too far."
The foreign minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama bore the responsibility to ensure that you have switched on "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden, the NSA's spying activities on public.
The leaked information is the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the president and I and others in the government learned of some things that are almost by autopilot expired, simply because the ability to do so, which is still in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, dating back to September 11."
He then acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spy had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, this inappropriate has gone too far."
The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation to ensure that no one needs to have the feeling that this abuse.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good, and were saved by its surveillance operations are many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is keen to kill people to blow up into the air and attacking governments.
So what would happen if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?

Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe, the concerns about the alleged American espionage to disperse and Europeans of the need to convince the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the United States, as the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs, said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others said, and was concerned about their threats, the frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency on anti-terror organizations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States, the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism to remain on board," said Murphy, who is sitting as a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and is working for European affairs, in an interview in Washington.
Moreover, I go to Europe, make it clear that in the fight against terrorism, we must continue to work together, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA millions of telephone data was collected in Europe, have relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service this week, said the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata, collected by NATO allies and with the United States had been exchanged.
Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and monitored up to 34 other heads of state in the world.

While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve relations, he said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that the European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs that they themselves used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs and protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones," the spy, Murphy.
Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry over the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest with parental leave
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in his plans to leave because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the assertion when he wanted to wipe off the table issues, whether it was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes will be cut or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers may have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott personally by the laws would benefit.
"He is a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they will leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission said Palmer with 53 votes ahead after the recount officially to the winner of the Sunshine Coast-seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process for the vote count, so that he can go faster.
Tony third daughters Frances and Bridget.
These elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have a system where you marches that enter data into a computer, and then immediately votes at 6: 30 p.m. in the evening is the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils with marking the ballot papers.
Using them, because then you can wipe out the results if they do not like one?
Today vote with pencils is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic voting and recently published a joint proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that an international airport belong to his policy on the Sunshine Coast, and that he will take his new post "very seriously."
A public office, it was about the service to the public.
"We strive for no reward except the history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
ESA decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects, which they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found.
Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or go to discover billion planets and thus perhaps alien life?
These issues, the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For her program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of the European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas on the table, five of which have come into the final round.
Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee should fall.
A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, which is to find the missions of the programme initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit their stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances life can there be?
Following this issue, is expected to start in 2017, the space telescope "royal dynasty," with the 500 known planetary systems are being investigated in our neighbourhood.
The options are limited, however, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments astronomers could map erdähnliche planet and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers" so: Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity.
As the solar system works?
This question will ultimately be light on what conditions are there for the emergence of life.
An important part of the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these events can be investigated as an example.
The Solar Orbiter "Esa has already a mission of the M-Class (there is the budget at about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is expected to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa sees the first of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is designed to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede KALLISTO.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions, and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid.
Perhaps deviations that could show the physicists on the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature can be combined.
How the universe was created and what it is?
13.7 billion years ago, our universe was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the familiar material from the stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
So far, the researchers do not know what were valid physical laws in the first split second of the Big Bang - measuring CMB, providing dark matter and dark energy.
"Euclid" has the Esa here already approved an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process left.
The best chances for a permit as L-mission, according to many experts "E-Lisa," an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Some physicists changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not yet proven.
Elisa that could create, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space.
It could prove contrary to plant on earth, gravitational waves that were created in the Big Bang, and so provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which, among other things, is to study black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," the planet is to detect and investigate erdähnliche.
Already retired include proposals for the samples-returning from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as to the solar physics.
CDC release allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies published by children in schools.
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued, as the number of school children with food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States, has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased, according to the CDC, between 1997 and 2007 by 18 percent.
The guidelines provide information for schools to the faculty and staff should be handled raise awareness of food allergies, and as with children who are allergic reactions.
It also recommended that schools have еще stock - the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most widely used - to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction to meet.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep еще easier stock.
The report also included a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is whether it" or "My tongue tickles."
Firefighters called to the rescue of a Hündchens that trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-dog Ruby was after a minor traffic accident gone
Three days later, she was discovered by a pedestrian in the quarry in their predicament
Firefighters are roped in rock wall and rescued the dog before the safe death
The firefighters managed to bring a dog in security, which trapped on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-dog Ruby was after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon running and survived three days alone, on Wednesday, before they were rescued from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, Ruby in reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had searched desperately for their missing dog and cries in social networks, while she was personally after the minor traffic accident in the quarry.
At around 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a pedestrian who said his dog, the Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high (in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and rope to rescue Ruby, who was then transported in a Hundebox upwards.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue teams, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
She was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
There was no muscle during their rescue - as she was frozen stiff.
But now it is her well.
Then she has eaten a couple of dogs.
This was a very unusual deployment.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue teams, said: "Ruby had a giant luck."
There is the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to a veterinarian for the investigation, but said nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "When watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor.
The vet said if the exhaustion has become too big and it would collapse, they would probably crashed.
The firefighters have done a great job.
It was very brave what they have done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall, but they remained above."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where they were.
U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" discovered the drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States have a "super-tunnel investigators" for drug smuggling discovered and shut down.
As the US Customs told, was the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Thus, three suspects were arrested, seized eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had been taken, according to the information not yet in use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can get away by digging under the radar," said the general prosecutor of the US District Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy said: "If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-running fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug-related crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year to complete.
The railway track was designed in such a way that electrically powered cars could be deployed there.
On the Mexican side of the access is located in a building, which is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimetres wide.
In doing so, he would have been well suited to encourage illegal immigration to the US.
Two of the suspects were in connection with the cocaine-Fund arrested.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it further said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off by now, Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego said.
You would do everything to get into the United States.
The detainees, no details have been announced, at least one is Mexicans, it said.
You have to reckon with prison sentences of up to 10 years.
Obama's withdrawal in the health policy
After intense criticism yesterday, President Obama made a U-turn on his oft-repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep them."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of resignation, the Republicans over the president in recent days that he had misled the American public.
Yesterday, Obama watered down its original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals Obama those Americans who have received such messages urged, to shop around on the open market, according to a new insurance.
Most people could be a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than projected.
"You get a better offer," he said.
The government described it as a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance, looking for another rate because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say directly to these Americans: You deserve better," said Liu's finely at a hearing before the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Liu's finely for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is responsible, said that the launch of the online platform since October "abysmal" is gone.
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This quote from a disgruntled finely Liu's one behind her seated consultant at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican House Billy Long from Missouri, whether they should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing Long finely Liu's repeatedly embarrassed with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily abandoned on a government-sponsored insurance to complete a tariff on Health Care .gov, whom she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Parents can choose from inter-sexual children "gender vague"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but will "vague" or "not" on the birth certificate.
The goal of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they will have no hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to fight against the discrimination of sexual beings.
An inter-sexual person, according to BBC years later said: "I am neither man nor woman.
I remain a patchwork that was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children comes every year, either as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the inter-sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was Inter-sexually.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts advise in the US, one should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before it decides - if any - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has focused on the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sound for a good cause."
-sexual children constitute an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have for life-threatening diseases that make a surgical procedure, but most children do not need it, he said.
We can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then wait to see how the identity is developing.
The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very closely.
No one knows why it is happening.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people to distinguish, for their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were in junior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, Inter-sexual, and transgender people face in the workplace and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the image of men and boys now have a special camp.
Now it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents, male, female or "third sex."
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first "gender-free" person acknowledged after a court, the lifelong maintenance of a "unspecified" gender status was granted.
German identity cards have alongside M and W, a third allocation in the future, X for Inter sexually, the Ministry of Interior.
In neighboring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US Catholic Online website has also voted against the German law, claiming: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone, it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned to a sex.
"The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you know the sex of their child," she told the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, known as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine regarded the sex as something that you could wipe out and then build new.
But now the ethical foundations are questioned an operation, now known as the gender identity is complex, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with their assigned gender.
"In the middle of the 20th century, one called it a" psychiatric emergency, "Drescher said.
If such a child was born, one called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that the sex was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as whether a person regard themselves as male or female.
But in one under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not, however," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still physicians who practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations have come to the public, who are "not happy" with the outcome.
For example, when Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born male XY chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So its external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and that something was amiss knew, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I have been sterilised in my birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation, he has become barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project that inter-sexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "for stamping and stigmatised" could encourage.
"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to", "she explained.
We fear that favours interventions.
We think it would be better to give the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because it allows adults, "the recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a war in which one should force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, supports a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authority" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.
The target because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Today, Katy 29 and is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.
Although it is barren, but hopes to get through adoption or a surrogate mother to a child.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they "male" or "female" write.
In this way, everything is fine, you take the child and loves it.
We have a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.
And we must not rush to make an operation that can no longer be reversed.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that concerns parents because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child determines the sex, which is more suited to him - and this is wonderful.
As a result, children will be able to make the decision themselves.
Excellent mastered the
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea," Horst Janson is cut to the body.
Janson itself is an old hand in his profession, the acting.
The old man Santiago, no one can fool the fishing.
So, the two complement each other really great.
It feels almost to the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, the fishermen young Manolo talks.
If Santiago is subdued tired of life on the chair, that is when Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a character role that Janson handles well.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and eventually through his knowledge and his will to win the battle against the fish.
Janson is in many respects as the only actors on the stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues are no moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water, are so real that the audience forget that the sea is blue lights out water bottles.
Director Jens Hassel man leaves the old man in the boat to act before the fishing village.
In the course of the show, he is the most active scene into the light: The factory of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, with their songs and her beautiful voice, admiring the attitudes of Cuba.
The four musicians to play Cuba's rhythm and at the same time, are guests of the bar.
Looking for ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis made the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous lovers.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and Chinese scientists could convince to produce the protein artificially.
The ice cream responds to eat with the tongue, making the pH in the protein and increased the glowing.
Chris says that the union would agree to the warmth in the mouth and lights - the more you licks, the lighter it is.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein in the ice cream reacts with the tongue in a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful PowerBook.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
His experimental company based in Bristol, is renowned for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That in itself is impossible because of the refraction, which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are produced by Chinese scientists artificially
Edwin: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical discussion forum
The next World discussion forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the castle is the subject of "To hell with the hell - theological reflections on today's dealings with the last things."
Advisor professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical discussion forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches Salem, of Salem and the culture ministry Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to pursue in the forum of the question of how people embrace the "last things" after death.
If the people "in the last few centuries of them knew too much and relied on those images of heaven and hell," which still shape our ideas, the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for completion by a certain embarrassment or even silence in question.
"The big hope has been driven Christians and Christians by religion criticism marks," the speaker said.
"You have provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation point seem to be lost to us."
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: "But the key challenge remains the bane of death."
This is the question for those longing, "the dreams that everything will be good in the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, graduated from 1982 to 1989 Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She graduated in 1997 for Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for fundamental theology and Ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute for Catholic theology at the University of Kassel.
Nonetheless, the fair's answer on wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important discovery that man can do," said the philosopher Soeren Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to achieve at least the wedding ceremony, a special exhibition in the domain in nonetheless was now.
Major providers represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has returned.
That starts with the wedding dresses.
White is essential, best covered in cream.
The often gerüschten and embroidery marked clothes are closed, often with a veil, on the other hand, they go down the back and often end up in tow.
Since the controversy, however, as Stefanie Koch stressed by the fashion house dresses Muller.

Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's patents, demands on Thursday, an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company in the bankruptcy auction of Nortel was outbid by him.
Rock star, the consortium that Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion purchase, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rock star is located in the community ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents affect technology, which put on the Internet searches in accordance with relevant advertising, according to the complaint, which is the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and rock star were not immediately available.
Samsung, HTC and Huawei produce mobile phones that use Google's Android operating system, which stands in sharp competition on the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave an initial bid more than $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and offered last 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel's patents have been outbid by rock star, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that is also part of Motorola's library of patents was motivated.
"Although Google has failed in his attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents to auction the patents, Google and continues to hurt," according to the complaint.
Rock star demands a high level of damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement was deliberately, the accusation.
Frankfurt parking fees are to rise sharply
Parking at Frankfurt could soon be sensitive more expensive.
The magistrate advises the city this morning on a template of Verkehrsdezernent Stefan Majer (Green).
So the parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
But this should not raise the prices, but the time interval of park watches and parking ticket machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city must then decide.
The retail committee of the Chamber of Commerce Frankfurt for the "is not a good idea."
The park just before the deal was "a significant advantage for smaller retailers."
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase is long overdue after two decades "entirely appropriate and actually."
The public transport will also be more expensive.
After oil prices are up to $96 per barrel
The price of oil has fallen even further on Friday, after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector is growing.
The benchmark crude oil for delivery in December had fallen by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 14 cents to $96,24 per barrel.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy of the United States said on Wednesday, the US offer last week have increased by 4.1 million barrels.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in the Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it was reached in the previous quarter at its lowest level in two decades.
The variety of Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, fell on the ICE exchange in London by 26 cents to $108,58 per barrel.
The disposable society thinks not
The night was long, loud music and the mood is good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and rear seat of the hunger is apparent.
Clearly, for one or two cocktail and champagne may be responsible.
What is being closer than chilled to the next drive-in to drive to get a little bit to go?
I admit that I am happy with it when it late at night or early in the morning to fast food-fetching.
A couple of French fries and a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed.
But on the way home are the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern.
What is missing one that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window throws?!
Especially at weekends discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
The people are too stupid to take the bags home or to the nearest dustbin?
It is not just that the paper stuff, the landscape.
Bags have also been concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents.
So what is said "disposable society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If you travel frequently in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know, as a back seat after by celebrated nights can be: Clothes, bottles and other garbage there.
There are a few bags would make more or less but also nix - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to eat on the remains of other rumtrampeln.
Already I can see the day coming when the removal of the cities and municipalities and running - and the fast food chains for their bags to demand deposit.
Milk and egg-alternatives at a glance
Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pürierter tofu cream with plants, for example, is a Quark replacement.
Another of vegetarians Federal calls for Weltvegantag on November 1.
The vegetarian Federal Germany proposes to mark World Vegan Day on November 1, a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure Flora margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt will be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, Hafer-, almond and rice milk can be used.
Premium-plants replace conventional whipped cream.
There are also eggs herbal alternatives.
Half a crumpled, ripe banana, for example, an egg can replace as a binder in a cake.
Even 50 grams or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water for them.
Soft doughs instead of egg are mineral water, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three Esslöffeln.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose.
According to the vegan Vebu around 800 000 people currently live in Germany, so a vegan.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money, the decaying highway system repair, and believe the solution in a small black box on the dashboard of every car.
The devices, each mileage record and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states, the antiquated system of financing American roads to review.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups, argue that the government of the small boxes to record the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven to use - and then use the information to calculate tax modest.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns.
But while in Congress could not agree on a course of action, several states are not waiting any longer.
You are looking at how they can over the next ten years to switch to a system in which drivers per-mile danger pay.
Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring, already tested.
This really is a must-have for our country.
"There is nothing that we will only use it," Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government processes said, which is planning a record of driven miles on all California motorists in the state in 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes, the Americans pay at the pump, broke.
But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state-run petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has increased for 20 years.
Politicians dare not at high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.
"The gasoline tax" is simply not sustainable, Lee Munnich, an expert on business law at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently 500 cars equipped with tachographs, a mile-based payment system is to be tested.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change is to be achieved.
But the Republican Bill Shuster made from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also said that he see it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are pleased with the idea to allow drivers to pay zurückgelegter route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, representing the people who need in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or travel to the city.
Several states and cities are still on their own in this direction.
The most active Oregon, which currently 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country is mobilizing.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering such a also.
Illinois, it is testing limited with trucks.
And the I-95-coalition, to which the transport ministries from 17 states on the east coast, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how one could introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.
The people wanted it.
When the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It is relatively easy to turn the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, which the state can capture the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, the public would be some.
The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small startup company called True mileage in California.
The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal, in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the miles driven to pay.
But the devices are tested for road planners are interesting, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," Ryan Morrison, managing director of True mileage said.
In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with motorists to give a series of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee, based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.
Others hope that the concept of a suspicious public sale by providing the equipment with more functions than with little.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which can also pay parking fees to be paid only for driving distances insurance must be collected and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers will be able to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," says a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether the pay per mile over all the talk is not only a huge distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the area of the San Francisco Bay for officials said, the Congress, the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund can simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for an operation, even if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do that hundreds of millions, of drivers about their privacy, and many other things.
Bad-Dürr home: A dream comes true for the
The importance of the city and the football club, the official inauguration ceremony forfeited to the artificial turf field, despite the cold weather and rain.
A more pleasing ceremony had wanted all last Saturday, but Peter wanted to play.
It had a disadvantage those who came without an umbrella or such a could hold for any reason.
It was the musicians who rounded up the ceremony, as many speakers.
Wet was so the FC-chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
His gratitude was led by Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had worked for the implementation of the project, the local council, the participating companies and association members who tabled.
Here, in particular, Lothar hero, Paul wheat Egger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioner relocated 400 square tiles for the new routes.
This remarkable voluntary commitment, the provincial deputy Karl Rombach acknowledged.
Further greeting words urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the southern regional football association, Kayan opportunity, and Friedrich Knorr spoke for the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth department at the club.
Mayor Klumpp pointed out that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn, the original lawns afflicted so that he could not be used.
Already 15 years ago, there was the first thought to solve the problem than has been thought to the construction of a third place at the site of the football clubs or secondary school at Salinensee.
Both have been discarded.
Six years ago, thoughts on the creation of an artificial turf sports field in what was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago, when the club took over the lease Schabelstube at a cost of EUR 100 000 pledged for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
Together, the council decided in October 2012, the acquisition of the remaining 356 million euros of the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp took.
The construction of the 68 times 108 metre artificial turf pitch took place on June 4.
During the three months of construction were 3,000 cubic meters of earth, half for the creation of a dirt-bike route was used.

Snowden, with Germany in terms of US surveillance to "cooperate"
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US Secret Service, said that he was willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag, if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander, no answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Stroebele met with Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum, with him to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday by Stroebele media in Berlin, he writes: "Even if the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive my government treats, a dissenting opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political expression with punishment, in which no defense is possible."
To tell the truth is not a crime. "
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community to persuade the American government could be to drop the charges against him.
The US Justice Department trial includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk with German representatives, then we can find ways to allow that."
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA had intercepted the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if it were possible, "without compromising him and ruining the relationship with the United States completely."
Stroebele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Stroebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor Snowden could not return to Russia, if he leave the country.
If Snowden des in Germany, then he will need an assurance that he was "sure" there, the Member.
Snowden said in his letter that he would be subjected to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven from his home.
However, he was "touched by the global response to" my act of political expression.
People around the world, as well as senior politicians, including in the United States, described the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive monitoring system as a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation has been resolved."
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration, calling for peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, they have their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and exchanged the crowd on Thursday in Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
A notorious rebel movement RENAMO, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa was once in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country back case back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years, could investment of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, ENI of Italy and Anadarko from the United States into the country.
The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and RENAMO are blaming each other for the tensions.
RENAMO claims that the government had provoked the recent clashes, as they had attacked on 17 October, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked RENAMO-bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government gives RENAMO, the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as a "loser" who "wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions of the government."
Both FRELIMO and RENAMO stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga quoted with the words, RENAMO to give the peace agreement in 1992.
To the FT, he explained that he meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and" seriously, Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide," says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an ailing movement's attempt to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Shrink Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, a former RENAMO member, founded Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), likely will improve in the elections.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He wants a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he wants no peace because he will not give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity RENAMO, but it has disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, Beira is, however, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after RENAMO announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.
RENAMO, the international community "wanted to warn that" things are not going well in Mozambique, Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government nor Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company says, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the future of the country and the government is responsible for the president and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Nobody interest RENAMO and FRELIMO, they simply want" just peace and usable roads, he said.
Hans Jacob moves again in FREIHOF
100 years ago, Henry Hans Jacob has taken his service in Haslach, on Sunday, his last years in the "FREIHOF" were alive.
The many spectators were impressed by the highly entertaining scenes.

And then the game started scenes, Alois Krafczyk highlighted once again in his famed role as a great son of the city.
Style, he drove with the "Black Forest Zweispänner and foxes" by Erich Becherer from mills.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann showed it incredibly well into the role of the sister -like oasis and awarded her extraordinary life with facial expressions and gestures.
Among the various game scenarios, the mills Bacher farmers played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded the performance.
On the awarding of honorary citizen Haslachs Mayor Heinz Winkler was then the honour of representing the former incumbent Hättich along with a part of the city council of his visit.
Then the singer made an appearance Dreikönig-, led by Hans Jacob, "Oh, as well as youth memories of my own three kings are alive again."
With their song "O Infant Jesus" breaking the audience in the FREIHOF like the stork tags with their children read "challenges, challenges."
His criticism of the official church Hans Jacob had also expressed his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the effects of industrialization, or the impact of the war.

Chinese newspaper should be reformed to call "
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded on the front page of the release of a reporter who had been charged with defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen admitted later on television that he had accepted bribes to forge reports on a part of state-owned company.
Now, the New Express will be subjected to a "comprehensive Rektifizierung," said the regulator.
The "Rektifizierunganordnung" was issued by the authority for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, between September 2012 and August 2013, several inaccurate reports of the listed companies posted zoom Lion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided to impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to deprive him of his reporter license. "
"We have also instructed the Yang Cheng Evening News Group to carry out a full Rektifizierung of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant authorities in the New Express and the leadership team of the New Express to check."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, where he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoom Lion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have zoom Lion damaged as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the trust of the public," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it in the first place, because I was on money and fame.
I realized that I have done wrong.
In the wake of Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they had failed to verify the reports.
Various known suspects have recently placed on television confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced to force despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been banned, someone to blame themselves.

The crowning conclusion is a visit to the church supper.
There, the lead participants get the story told by the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a Catholic area through and through.
Last but not least, the views of Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg semi-Ritter created Supper paintings in the church.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
At the meeting point changes - half-hour leadership is at 3 p.m. on the nuclear basement museum.

Mick Jagger said that he had never turned on Katy Perry, when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, said the pop star, she had as a backing singer at Jaggers song "Old such" Die Hard in 2004.
Perry said that she had with the gun at dinner eaten, and that he has "angebaggert me when I was 18."
She added: "It is a long time ago and he was very kind to me."
In a statement, a representative said Jaggers, 70, on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made overtures to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe they had confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who in the Rolling-Stones tour this year had a guest appearance.
Her new album, "Prism" landed on the first attempt at No. 1 this week.
NSA says, an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site
The shadow of National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had crippled their public Web site a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed online.
"NSA.gov tonight was unavailable for several hours, as during a scheduled update an internal error," explained the spy agency in a message sent via e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outage was executed by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) has been caused, is not true.
In the early evening hours spent online server sites noticed that the NSA website at least six hours was not available and this will continue for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA to ABC News had declared that the sensitive internal network of the authority was "compromised in any way."
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman.
At least one group of said was, the NSA website with a DDoS-attack crippled.
In such attacks, the target site is awash with page until the servers are overloaded and the site will collapse.
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The super-secret NSA, whose nickname once No search Agency (No such authority) was now finds himself in the bright light of the public and sees itself in recent months after the reported revelations about their extensive surveillance program at home and abroad under severe criticism - a result of the secret NSA data from disaffected former NSA employee Edward Snowden stolen and published.
The growing controversy over the secret police fired on initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a deliberate Cyperoperation.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence analyst Edward Snowden could in the US Spähaffäre in his Russian asylum claims.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General's Office could either ask questions in writing or the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
The agency Interfax reported, citing unidentified named circles who are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved between the state, it said.
The Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case," he loses his refugee status, the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened, the extradition, it said
Children should receive myths and legends as "role models for life" taught, an author says.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and, in some cases, too dirty," to be taught in schools, so Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" age just works pleaded.
"I think it is wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have suggested that for 20 years as a plan.
He added that authors and teachers who were "overly didactic," children "would completely shut down," because the messages in entertaining stories "undercurrent" would be conveyed.
Crossley-Holland, the Bible has been translated from the turning point and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British folk tales, said: "You can follow certain intentions, but we should keep them in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
It has to be presented subliminally, be revealed by the history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show rather than telling.
They thought that travel agencies are a thing of the past, thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to defy the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the full year and expects to record earnings from holiday makers in Australia and Britain.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before tax of between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305-315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, it means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290,4 million dollars in 2011 / 12.
As managing director Graham Turner announced Flight Centre, in the first half of eight percent gain and reported a strong start in the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable, and some of them are" on the right track toward record annual income before interest and taxes, he said.
In Australia and Britain, which are typically belong to our strongest result winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, making up for a slightly weaker market for business trips.
Similarly, it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Britain, while the business customers also spent less.
The US business rebounded against the seasonally weaker first half, for the third year in a row, a gain for the full year is expected.
The shares of Flight Centre yesterday rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.

Post hardly unloads on Sunday
"Many people will have noticed it yet, for the red points Sunday Lee storage are still in various post boxes of the core city and neighbourhoods, but you read the small print on the yellow boxes of Post AG, one finds that the collection on Sundays and public holidays is no longer," with the FDP shares.
A question of the FDP have confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays will just before the post office building in the Ernst-Ludwig-Strasse 36 and Jacob-Müller-Straße 1 in huts field emptied.
Whether even Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten, will be answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and political spokesman for the FDP, Fritz tubes Beck, wants to hook here.
The Sunday Lee is currently in appointment post an important postal service.
"This thin this business despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, radical and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, group and city association chairman of the Liberal support, his colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the collection times" surreptitiously here will be changed or deleted.
Citizens of the post is miles away.
"At least" must be emptied the post boxes in the quarters Neuschloß and rose again on Sunday, Bittner and tubes Beck unison.
The core city of tariffs, especially mobile citizens must have a postbox on Sunday, Lee also within walking distance.
Beck asked tubes in the city parliament, whether the city government plans talks with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with water.
His knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday in Hofheim Lee.
Her party has called for privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.

Haslach: Scepticism is increasingly confident
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, will change in the ministry unit Haslach (SE) mission.
Then there is only a single parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting of the councils from Haslach, years later, mills, fishing stream, Alpine and catfish Chen health prepared on Saturday to the changes.
Because nothing is more in the fundamental decisions to change the diocese and the parish councils to implement them as well.
In the course of the day, it was very clear: The skepticism about the new is tentatively but increasingly a confidence.
The ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council filed the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main official of the ministry teams.
Regional dean George Schmitt explained in a presentation of the revised guidelines for ministry units in the diocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach forms as a parish in the future, a public body that enters the rights and obligations of the past six individual parishes.
There will be only a single parish council and a foundation board, where the pastor force office is represented.
In every parish at least two elected members are to be represented in the six parishes so-called community teams will be formed on the ground.
Their task will be to promote the religious life in the village.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish considerable conversation needs showed.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets remain in the parishes earmarked.
By contrast, the liabilities go to the whole community.
Particularly in view of the large planned investments, whose commitment to make all parishes, there have been major concerns.
"In the past has been invested in projects that could be managed by individual parishes alone," Haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prince Bach relativism.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbarian Knight, the chairman of the board at the ministry unit Schutterwald-Munich.
In 2006, they had to be "One, five remain" and noted that it is not so simple.
The bodies of the Haslacher ministry unit were then to answer the questions on the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the local teams.
The compositions are specified in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish council Michael Pleasant from Steinach presented the new logo of the ministry unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT-measure, but still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, in the budget for 2012, a stamp tax at a rate of 7% had imposed on homes that cost more than two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers, the apartments as a company and not as individuals.

Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of legislation against the circumventing one can hardly claim that high-value properties are taxed too low, despite the impact of the old county tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors cautious about buying property in London, or prevent owners to sell," he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market after prices - in London's affluent southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, gave rise to a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London had a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were from an emerging "overshadowed" domestic market, where the southwestern part of the city, the North (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a survey by Savills.

The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.
The revelation is the surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark John and get healthy man on the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president Topberater "extensive group meetings and opinion polls at the end of 2011" had carried out to find out whether the appearance of Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election better if he let fall Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book carefully traces the history of efforts from senior officials of the campaign and the White House to exchange names of former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers, the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" is claimed, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden, despite their "close, personal relationship" before it finally decided against such a move after the data showed that the Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama."
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and this was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
We must remember that the president had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN said that the re-election of considerable effort has been made during the campaign to find out whether such a move is paid in relation to the ballot box.
"In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said on CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he does not believe that the president of the possible change was "aware" that the former chief of staff, admitted that it was "possible" that Obama did not know about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings have reached Obama's desk.
Martin Cooper, whether he seriously think asked Obama knew nothing of the inquiries about whether we should let Biden in the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
Local council welcomes sound budget
Whenever it comes to City Council meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in oven cheeks-Schönach is well stocked and debt already knows the administration no longer since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can be recorded in this sense as an unqualified success.
This was during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Roth mouth explained that the administration budget has been with around 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget bed with some 1.8 million euros, about one million euros over the approach.
Thanks to the surplus was mainly higher business tax revenues and the share of income tax.
The capital budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the proposed EUR 1.5 million last year, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million.
"This is due largely to the higher feed from the administrative budget," says Roth.
As for the financial year 2012 are made less investment than planned, the reserves feeding is higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by about EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Roth mouth and her team for the good work.
"So you don't shake a work" simply from the sleeve, Gerster praised overlooking the annual financial statements.
He and the local councils were visibly on the good figures.

Desperate cry of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He said that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes
Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
Currently, I read a terribly sad book.
It is a book which I have believed that it would be sad council during the second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
In the evening, when I'm finished with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and rob a talk the breath.
The election was a landslide victory and intelligence spokesman being considered to lead the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
That changed when Obama into office in 2008, he had approval values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is taken from a dream.
It is hard to remember this optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made my voice for the first time, in fact, something has changed.
But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things, which Obama has achieved, the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced city of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan obstruction tactics have tilted too many efforts that our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after countless times, the Obama administration has defended with colleagues and friends, I am with my statement try at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy could not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency data about the private lives of Americans and why be punished whistleblowers who disclose government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media were "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And it cannot excuse jüngstens's inability to draft in more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a simple website.
I don't know if it is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have to understand that the government could contradict the work of her previous political campaigns.
Obviously, this is not a predictable course Abgeordnetenamt, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre-shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I have chosen Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not define its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would meet the hope that we have heard for so long.
But with the sinking of the ratings for Obama to less than 45% this week is a return to the year 2008 through this book has become even harder.
It is the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air makes me.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has dealt a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to" rediscover our magic, he said.
We need to remember who we are. "
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.

The electricity is more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the director of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne bias, opposite the SUEDKURIER confirmed, on a four-person family Pfullendorfer 70 to 90 euros per year in additional costs.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of so-called EEG levy of 5,277 at 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is set in October every year from the four operators of the major power lines.
They put them out of the Energiewende excess costs, which they can raise through a levy on the price of electricity.
The city Pfullendorf works are the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company was in its forecasts, even from a higher levy, like Jörg-Arne bias.
Now the specific pay should be calculated before the Stadtwerke next week could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
"We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x from" bias, with the number rather close to the 2 cents will lie.
Josef Winkler writes for more than 30 years, the plight of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the silence, the tendency to brute force and blunt sexuality, cornering and instability, has described the poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer, theater texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher arranges for his performance "storms on the tongue tip," which is now visible in the garage X on St. Peter's Square, a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker about combines elements from the autobiografisch-novel "The Serf" (1987) with prose miniatures from "corpse, his family belauernd" (2003).
The largely emptied stage - important props: A zerknautschtes sofa, kopuliert on hints and masturbating, the eight-member ensemble hangelt through the text material.
The director Fresacher seems to trust the text.
The 70-minute performance obscures the template with a plethora of directing incursions, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
Above all, the actresses come off in the sometimes rather dubious scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, bathed with his head under water, getackert with their gowns to the wall.
Sandwiched in cellophane or bodice they workshops to dangerously high others through the staging, either they are monologisieren loudly or completely silent on the stage floor.
The text conveys to the hard way, however.
The best moments of the evening, when it is sung - from Deep Purple to popular-song.
Not until the end of the show is shot on something to rest, and Winkler's after just absurd humor to bang.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giant
The chances of the league of athletic-increase Ludwig Burger Bundesliga accounts have risen.

The basketball-project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible Nachrückerplatz.

An initial sigh of relief from Ludwigsburg, however, was not to hear.
"We do not look at the wild card, as long as it is clear that Düsseldorf receives no license," said Neckar-giant-boss Alexander because of our newspaper.
Until May 23 upstart Düsseldorf Basket can still file papers with the Court of Arbitration and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, the Rhine countries was denied the license but twice.
The arbitration is the last resort.
