The parliament did not support an amendment to liberate Timoshenko
The Parliament of Ukraine has pushed back today the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Penal code in which there is condemned the leader of the opposition Yulia Timoshenko.
The modification minister would open the doors for the release from prison of exfirstly, but the parliamentarians pushed back the proposal to reduce the sorrow for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the supposed signature of an agreement with Russia disadvantageously for Ukraine on natural gas buy.
The judgment is still not firm, the court of appeal has the obligation to check it in December.
Timoshenko proved to be convinced that it was a question of a political revenge of the diet, and even in Occident there have arisen doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal from which there was moving back the paragraph 365 of the Penal code with which minister was condemned to ex-firstly was supported by 147 deputies in the voting.
For its approval 226 votes were needed.
The victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar the-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is already no war.
It stays for defines who the winner is
Since it is already a custom in the region, the Islamist ones gained the elections, but now it is a question of elucidating if it talks each other of moderate or radical
The National Council of Transition has made to come into force the traditional law, the sharía, which already in certain way we know.
Libya will turn in a country without crime, because the hand will cut the thieves.
The women can already be forgetting to become emancipated and the apostates waiting for its execution and this way successively.
Instead of for the person of the dictator, the society consisted of warlike tribes, will join for the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that we do not prune ourselves to imagine and that certainly we cannot.
Nevertheless, our form of life is neither the nor only one objectively the best and, probably, it was not convenient, on the other hand, for the already mentioned Libyans.
The true thing is that it does not stop being surprised that the Islamic combatants were accepting been grateful the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, it was not directing the attacks of the NATO an American, but big general is Allah, whose nobility they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are looked in Libya, Occident is not between them.
We are caught in a shooting of which the Islamist ones and our politicians make use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without there being guarantees to obtain benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya in a military way.
In this case, to the places a problem does not suppose them to expel the "crossed ones"
But, without occupation: will they obtain the oil companies to be done by the alone Libyan black gold with good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it can be that finally Occident could presume to protect the human rights.
Whenever the followers of the sharía do not cross us.

Daily menu of an obese child: it has not for breakfast and has sausages for dinner
More than one third of the children with ages understood between 9 and 13 years has problems of excess weight, where the excess weight affects 9 % of the school population and the obesity to 5 %.
The obese children come mostly from families with a life style that is not healthy, as it gets rid of current investigations.
It turns to demonstrate what is the importance of the ambience where it grows in confidence for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
In the table, the obsessed children feed, for example, of embedded at least on the frequency double that the family children with normal weight.
To have dinner, more than 19 % of the obese ones had had chips for dinner the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "The obesity is not a coincidence".
In the children's families with excess weight there does not exist habit of going in for sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15 % of the children answered that its parents, at least once per week, find time for the physical exercise.
Survey realized to 900 children
The survey was realized at the end of last school year and there took part in the same one almost 900 children of Basic education of the whole Czechia.
It was already the second edition of the program of "The obesity of es a coincidence", that there supports the Company of General Sanitary Insurance and the company Unilever.
Till now, more than 12 thousand children have taken part in the project from the 4th one up to the 8th course.
A suitable diet and enough exercise in family there are determinant factors, which the number of children makes diminish significantly with excess weight and even an obesity.
"Only half of the polled children has answered that have five daily meals as the diet: I have breakfast, have lunch, meal, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", he gathers one of the results from the survey.
Without breakfast but with sausage to have dinner
The specialists warn that, in a healthy development, there are important, also, the details, which also count, as for example to have a fixed hour for the breakfast in family.
In Czechia, nevertheless, only 23 % of the students' families has breakfast at the same hour.
In most of the families, each one has breakfast only.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10 % of the hearths nothing has been for breakfast.
The breakfast is, nevertheless, the base of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children the insane chips are consumed by a lot of more frequency.
Almost they all - independently of the weight - drink every day sweet refreshments (70 %).
For general norm they go in for sport more than 40 % of the polled children, nevertheless, bring in its parents this result it diminishes at least of the half, only 15 %.
Make your diet to yourself
The following phase of the study made possible that the elected lads (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) were creating their own diets from all the possible offers as its tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of the Czech children in ages understood between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy feeding, are much removed from the ideal thing."
Between its favorite food there are the pasta, the meat and the sweets
"There is especially alarming the popularity of the sweet refreshments", it is warned in the final report of the study.
As main meal gains the garland the pasta and the bird meat follows him closely.
Practically, the children always push the vegetable and the taste back for the fish and the vegetable is very low.
I change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that the children are ready to change its food habits if they receive the just information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who refilled the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "The obesity it is not a coincidence", an important change happened in many cases in favor of the beginning of a healthy feeding", it signs up in the results of the study.
There attracts attention, for example, the relative thing to the sweet refreshments, where many children would begin preferring the normal and current water.
The children also would choose with more frequency in the questionnaire the meat of bird and the fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet meal and the derivatives of flour.
The stylist has to be also a good psychologist, support the professionals
In the introductory article, How do the stylists learn, either I complained a little of that the initial lessons either they were loaded enough.
It had not even idea of how that one would go.
Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress problematic personages and, also, a seminar on how it works in the world of the spectacle.
And it will be worse.
The closer are the final examinations, the more information and practical tasks wait for us
And although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, already a pin does not fit.
We are time have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how dressing the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And this way it is the majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a figure stylized without the suitable curves and someone suffers excess weight.
The stylist has to can smooth optically a few wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us certain tricks on how making to emphasize the women's body of the type of Jennifer López, of breasts and enormous hips but narrow waist and at the same time not to dress it in a too challenging way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or the pants do not adapt themselves, it is worth while making sew at least a piece of extra cloth to measurement.
Undoubtedly they will not repent, because the clothes that sits perfectly are unpayable.
With a skirt to measurement it will be sorry better than with one who not of to move, getting up, dances in the waist, etc.
The stylized body one can be allowed to dress clothes in creases, adornments, embroideries or drapeados.
There are certainly many types of diverse informations and of bodies, so I am satisfied that I have of the whole week to clear up in my head all this information.
And even this way, I am afraid that with the assigned task, already I have more than in abundance.
Every participant in the course has been assigned by two famous persons, to whom he will have to design two wardrobes: one for the day and other for the night.
It is necessary to bear in mind the current aspect, the fashionable style that adapts the person in question.
It has had me to "dress" Miranda Kerr, perhaps know it of the campaign of Victoria's Secret.
I shout inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have fattened approximately hundred kilos (please, bear in mind the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gómez.
The garments we have to cut them away of the magazines or look for them in Internet and to print them, later to prepare them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as it is called to the finished result, expresses also our personal style and our relation with the graphic design.
It is important also to think about the graphic part of the fashion design.
The stylist, therefore, does not dress only physically, but also it deals, for example, with the products pages in the magazines (of concrete topics, like tendencies, purses, overcoats, etc.).
About all this there spoke to us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this stays already for Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
Three invited specialists cheered the Saturday conference up with informations especially type of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorn ý, the fashionable designer Jakub Polanka and the fashionable photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded to us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to extract party to this.
And a good stylist can work with the same garment of diverse forms.
The changeability is, in this case, fundamental.
This way, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can dress itself to the classic thing in jeans and T-shirt, but also it serves to dress the naked body in heel shoes and to photograph it as if it was in fact a garment.
Or it is enough to roll up it and raise the neck to obtain a completely different image.
"Play with it", he insisted to us.
What more I value is the following advice: "To begin working, it is necessary that first you know all the rules".
"Then you can already break them", said Jakub.
Finally I have left clear why we memorize all these formulae, what gets together with what, why, if then it turns out that in the fashionable magazines we are proved different.
That without speaking about the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation of the one that he tries to photograph.
This way, for a fashionable history that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), it is necessary to have fifteen prepared, ready to use, at least.
And as well as the photos the clothes work in combination with other pledges, all of them different from those who are used in the reality.
All this is necessary to bear it in mind at the time of designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn ý made sure us that alone they suppose the image and the style, in many cases, half of the success.
It is enough to look to Madonna, who is not precisely an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have done of her a world star.
In Czechia, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Up to the famous personages also they find it useless (my skills are enough to me, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
And when someone asks us for our services, it is necessary to bear in mind that it is very probable that they indicate us a size very different from his real (minor).
Then only it stays guglear and to find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the topic, if a certain celebrity has fattened / slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted us in that it is not enough to the stylist to face in the fashion, but it has to understand of outfit.
During its work, especially it is necessary to communicate with the people whom it dresses, therefore fundamental being is a good psychologist.
He can value the people, is not done of less, defends its opinions.
"When a director hires you so that you classify the wardrobe and complete it with nice pledges, you cannot take and throw everything what existed and say: "huy what horror"".
"Find at least a pair of things that you could consider and recommend so that someone could put them", says Mario.
He also showed us himself that everything the labor exchange must fit in the call "placovka", that is to say.
This one notices about the waist and all the necessary hardware is had there.
There are objects like scissors, like scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There is also thread of nylon (that serves to the stylist during the meeting of photos of such products that purses or caps), special tweezers of harnessing of pledges ahead, if it is be major (the pins and another type of harnessings are not allowed, since they might damage the textile), or a seam game.
We not to have left in the passive listening and to put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photos meetings in the study, in a flat surface, it was possible to damage the sole and very much even more the exterior.
And we did not do any more that to cover and to cover.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors not to damage them for accident.
So it was necessary to be very skillful.
Mario has made me happy on having praised my work without reservations.
The truth is that these skills are not given me very well.
This is alone a small part of everything to those that we have listened during the whole weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that to devote myself to the fashion design at a professional level is not a way of rose, but it gives me exactly equally what the people say.
En Necesidad de Velocidad: La Carrera se compite por toda América.
Critique
A trip, at first unconcerned, is complicated because of a series of improper oversights of a routine trip during the tomorrow shift.
Up to a point it became possible to cover the expectations, but it does not serve as anything, if, in fact, nothing was trying to become extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added to the title, already woke up big expectations before its premiere.
It was promising that it would give new airs to the ancient saga of careers Need for Speed and, immediately after the showed, it appears like a game that should not end up by being again an action genre without much ado.
Also we feel curious for knowing how there would stay the inserted scenes, where the main personage descends from the car and walks along its own foot.
Since it usually happens in the series of NFS, the results do not change big thing with regard to what we were waiting for ourselves.
There are careers that can be considered acceptable, but in the entire calculation points get lost because of absurd mistakes, which have already appearing in the series for years.
In fact there cannot even be named errors, but it is a question rather of the incomprehensible lack of appetite of the programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
One introduces you in a history, which protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, it is offered him to take part in an illegal career for the whole America.
You sit down to the frill on the coast west, in San Francisco, and your mission is to come the first ones to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route splits into ten stages and, then, into more than fifty careers.
Of it it is deduced that every career takes place for a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which turn out to be quite diverse and interesting.
This way, one has not even vaguely the sensation that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments turn out to be even agreeable at sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is not anything of another world.
But the walk along the desert, the autumnal scenery or the high covered mountains of snow produce a very agreeable visual effect.
Also, the careers diversify occasionally for an atypical element.
This way, for example, in the desert you are a sand thunderstorm that diminishes the visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains it is necessary to be careful so that an avalanche does not bury you.
According to that, each of the careers is very well developed.
Only there is a pair of models, but with that it is enough.
During a moment, you try to pass to a demanded rivals quantity (the normal thing in a classic career), later you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel waits for you against only one adversary.
In the middle of all this there appear sometimes the police, which does not do but to make difficult moreover the things.
The sceneries are the innovation out of the car.
Interactive animations appear when Jack, in most cases, has to escape of someone and you have to help it, always touching the just button in the just moment.
Nothing complicated.
It turns out to be surprising, nevertheless, that there are enough less sceneries in the game of for what it would be necessary to wait (in particular there is only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the already mentioned context, it is one of the elements that do that the game turns out to be more interesting.
The conduction model continues the traces of the previous episodes.
That means that to today it is already not a big thing, but it is not possible to affirm that it should be bad.
If you look for a realistic simulation, already you can look in another part.
But to a career conceived with enough action this conduction style is convenient for him enough, although we will be able to find something better between the games of the competition.
So far, quite in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
In contrast to the correct of the models of conduction, already the same does not happen with the collisions.
Of games of this type it is not necessary to hope that it should recreate distortions and collisions complicated, but de facto before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, after the car does a very exact or circular overtaking with a normal traffic, only there are light rubbings, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up by doing uncontrolled twirls.
Or it even finishes completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reseteo system, big problems do not arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The reseteos are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or leave of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point in the track.
Nevertheless, in every career only he gets ready of five reseteos available.
If you all consume them, you have to begin the career again from the beginning.
So it is only a help in case something is not fine, but it is not much of giving credit.
Sometimes, the reseteo does not even help, only it helps the given memory stage being learned.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts recur in different places.
For example, it is necessary to enter some curves in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you are always in some place "civil" vehicles with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth ones or come five minutes earlier or later.
This does of being furious especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent passes without problems, but when you come, you must turn or brake.
It is equal when you come, because it is programmed why the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nostril.
The adversaries have also one more advantage.
During the whole game you will come to places where, without bearing in mind the moment, the same adversary will always move forward you in the same place.
Also this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which turns out to be even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at the price that is.
When it goes in front of you, you are made difficult by the vision of the cars that come straight ahead, so at first you can do mush the car.
It is possible to understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that of course I disappointed you at once.
And it is a sorrow, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is entertained and with action, so that often it is not possible to continue to the detail what happens not where.
And really it does not matter, if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the career so that the boredom does not fit, or any other thing.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the careers.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline fountains next to the highway, because exactly there you have to change car, although in the majority of the cases it will be enough to you what you have.
The cars split into three categories.
The sports ones are adapted for urban areas, the American strong cars for the straight freeways and the exotic supersports ones for a technical conduction, for example, for mountain highways with curves.
Also main narrative thread also appears a parallel challenges thread, that is to say, there are careers in concrete places that you will know for the histories.
Here you will obtain not alone medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves so much for the challenges as the stories.
On having reached the top level, the driver several possibilities are opened to him, starting by the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, it has connected a function Autolog in line, which compares your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other community functions.
One of the elements most difficult of understanding is how the last career is done in the history.
With the car you come up to the tunnel of the meter (pass), where you start running in the dark for the routes (pass).
The speedometer marks between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) to you and, suddenly, behind the convoy of the meter comes to you and one takes you ahead without much ado.
In the writing of course we will have a discussion on this for several days, if during the programming of the game none thought even a little or if the authors really take us as a fools' panda.
The technical part of the game is not extraordinary at all, but at least the general visual effects turn out to be in most cases agreeable, sometimes even haughty.
Since what sorrow that, in the tensest moments the image quality diminishes and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This affects especially to the accidents where it has involved many participants, when the quality of continuous image is already not valid.
The audio is well and the sound-track is a tastes question.
In order that it is from the taste to most of the juvenile group, the sound-track belongs to the category "each of its father and of its mother", but it is possible to be supposed that nobody would buy the alone game for its music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is so quite confused.
If the game was avoiding absolutely dumb errors, we would have ours problems in affirming that The Run is the best game of NFS of last years.
It gives the sensation that the game is not concluded.
The diversion is assured, but prepare you because the errors will strike you in the eyes with the force of a few searchlights of airport.

The ambassadress before the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a negativistas reputation and Eurosceptic.
"The agreement of Lisbon has affected significantly to the balance between the individual institutions"
"He was not waiting for me that an all-out war was mounted".
"It will last five, six years, before the situation becomes stable a little, calms down and the new players get accustomed to its new roles", this way the Czech ambassadress began with conviction its conference in the faculty of Right before the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously its motto "egg white and openly on Europe", that said already in the first part of its conference, when it managed to describe every organ of the EU and its relations with such a precision and clarity, since it would be the envy of many lecturers of the faculty of Right of U. Carolina.
Vicenová also considered the work of of the new permanent president of the European Advice, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing the criticism arises, that if it is insipid, a gray official, capable of assuming any roll, but I have to say that it made all disconcerted, because it assumes its rolls to the perfection".
"He is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has the clearest vision of where the EU must go".
The representative's new position of the Foreign policy and Safety is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? To what number can I call it?". It is a question so of an important step towards the unification and the clarification of of the political union facing the States like China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit us the Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has dealt also with the agenda it continued, it continues and it will continue the European Advice in the next future.
The presidency two-year ago-old Czech was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emergent economic crisis, solved the crisis of the gas and organized a summit for the Oriental Association.
The fall of the government in that moment was identified like a very negative aspect, which it affected seriously to Czechia.
The Czech representation in the EU has for the time being many commitments.
In words of the ambassadress: "a good clamor", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is talking each other now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic, much more complicated situation.
If the budget is simpler and effective: what sectors will have priority, what countries will receive major support and which less? This is something that will be present in the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassadress remembered also its main mottoes, with which it came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The true thing is that I do not like the ugly abbreviations, the foreign words or the slangs that the people do not understand".
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels there do not invent really the cucumbers the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of diverse sizes or that nobody is going to prohibit us the Olomouc cheese?".
Also he tries to extract more profit of the ambience of the EU and bring more Czech citizens over to the European institutions.
The Europe of the speeds waits for us
According to the ambassadress, the Czechs have reputation of Eurosceptic and the people perceive rather the negative aspects that the positives.
Also, he was sorry about the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is of multitude of factors, like the modesty of our candidates, its incapability to write motivation messages, but also small support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it emphasized the force and the collaboration of the Group of Visegrad.
"Believe to me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and me a Slovak approaches, a Frenchman next to me says to me:" What, already have you stayed, those of the Group of Visegrad?", and it is seen that it does not do any grace to him".
In the future, according to Vicenová, new regulations wait for the EU durísimas of budgetary politics for the Member states.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of two speeds, if they are not any more, in Europe, any more than the new one of "the European Federation".
"We have countries in the Euroarea and countries out of the Euroarea".
"We have the space Schengen and have also the procedure of reinforced cooperation".
"It was said for the first time that only there should cooperate the countries that they want and that not, that remain out".
"These procedures will be increasingly and they will reinforce the Europe of two speeds", is hoped Vicenová.
In this sense, also he emphasized the role of Czechia and of Herman van Rompuy in the application of the beginning, according to which all the topics that they affect to the totality of the EU must be debated between the member states, not only between the members of the Euroarea.
Historia de marca:
The innovator IBM initiates its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that was defining with big precision the strategy of IBM, the most approximate it would be "a long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, nevertheless, they have already passed hundred years from its foundation.
The base of this character largoplacista it was put by the first chief of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already minted the motto of which many problems of the world have solution if the people are ready to think.
Its motto "Think!" it turned into its stamp, concerning which there will be constructed the life of the future giant (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the base of a culture of carefully elevated company.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement in direction of the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for hundred years for that reason, because it stayed faithful to its basic beginning, but without being afraid of the changes around.
That has allowed us, for our first century, to be transformed by the technology, the business and the society.
We hope to prosper moreover in our second century", he affirmed during its anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 30s, worried about the care of its personnel like the Baťa businessman in Czechia (the IBM personnel belonged to the first American workers who enjoyed full holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that was rewarding the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains his IBM in the relation with the client.
Already from the beginning the company could discover talents (to the being one of the world companies first in finishing with any type of discrimination, could choose without problems).
In the line of the strategy antidiscrimination is the current plan of IBM, with which a woman will replace Palmisano the next year: Virginia Rometty.
She goes already being employed thirty years at IBM, where he has been a sales manager, marketing and strategies.
During the last years IBM has taken part of the called virtual meetings, rain of ideas in line, from which they arise infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not of surprising that ideas remain, since at the signature almost half a million persons is employed.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides to the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained an institution concept more that of technological company", affirms the economist teacher of Harvard Business School and authoress of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology", there specifies George Colony of the counsel Forrester Research.
As the proper company says that a difference exists between entering the business and creating straight a business.
IBM - or "Big Green" - as it is known in the USA unceremoniously because of its logo, one has turned into last hundred years in one of major companies of the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technological company (it develops so much teams like programs, infrastructures and services web accommodation inside a wide range of services, which go from servants up to nanotechnology).
It shows the biggest number of patents of all the North American technological companies and five of its personnel have received the Nobel Prize.
Between its inventions there are the cash dispenser, the cards of payment, the financial exchanges, the bar codes and the diskettes.
IBM will invoice this year 220 billion dollars. This year has turned into the second technological signature for capitalization of market (the first one is Apple), when it overcame for the first time in 1996 Microsoft.
Looking at the future
Not all the products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of the clients and the moment (IBM did not bet for its own operating system, OS/2, services in line Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).
"If its business is based in advancing, one cannot anchor emotionally in the past", was admitting Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why, IBM has no problems in constructing its bases in other platforms (and the same way, if they do not work, it leaves them).
And it the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which basically is supported and always exclusively falls down with Windows.
Future technology
Concerning sales, IBM devotes itself especially to services, of which approximately a fifth part they are of programs and another country house of teams.
In spite of everything, in 1990 the teams were still representing more than half of the quota of the providers.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold assets of low yield for an entire value for 15 billion dollars. During in the same period, he has invested 58 billion dollars in the buy of technology of future.
The investments have continued from 2008, when for the first time the modern world financial crisis was evident.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the big economic crisis of 29 increased the investments.
It seems that till now the company IBM has been able to get over the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM from the beginning of the year 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120 %, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
The IBM currency is to change everything, except its value.
It is possible to hope, then, that when it avenges the following crisis, this flexible giant will last.
History of IBM: from the cutter of cheeses up to the spatial flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in the year 1924 - originally it was a question of a mark used in the divisions of Canada and South America.
The base that gave place to the IBM birth arises from the merger of four companies that go back to the decade of 1880.
It was possessing inventions as the famous "clock of recording", that allows to control the entry and exit of the personnel.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided at its advice supervisor.
Flint recorded the chief of a company of the competition, Thomas J. Watson, so that it was helping it with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson keep on being the strong basis on which the corporate culture and identity are sustained).
Watson directed the company until the year 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, it started with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, from cutters of meat and cheese up to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the invoicing doubled in 9 million dollars and the big expansion of the company started by the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, almost after forty years occupying the chair of the chief, was replaced by its son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began being employed at the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first computer language.
In the 60s the personnel and the computers of IBM helped the NASA to guide the flights to the space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM was developed by the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.
The outstanding figures "pecés", that restored the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computers production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which for his part, acquired the part of consultancy of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering a finished advice and services of high extra cost.
The strategy that has paid IBM these last three years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is to say, "a more intelligent planet".
Its target is to make a more rational use of the technology, although the areas have not been planned yet the circumstances have not even been improved, for example, in the relative thing to the transport and the administration of cities.
For the sector of the commerce, IBM presented not long ago the platform "Smart Commerce" that allows to the retailers to manage the finished commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a division in the Czechoslovakia of then, the first country that had it in the Central and Oriental Europe.
Today here, the IBM ČR produces also the strategic center of outsourcing in Brno.
The head office for Central and Oriental Europe has it is in Prague. Also here there is a team of investigation of world reputation that works with the speech recognition.
Rychtářová about its unfaithful husband:
Iveta, remain to this donkey, which I already do not want!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said: it was finished!
After its husband Josef Rychtá ř had turned (53) into the only protector of Iveta Barto ová (45), but also its lover, Darina kept on having the hope that Josef was waking up of its pink sleep and it would return to house.
Nevertheless he is already not going to wait and has established clear rules for the life in the future.
"Pepe can return to house, but already not like my couple", told Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová received during the summer Barto ové in its house, it could not even imagine how its marriage would finish.
In spite of the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even declared publicly that it loved it.
With the time, Darina resigned himself, seemingly he accepted the relation of its husband and even said goodbye of him forever.
ř it does not import for Rychytá with whom its wife goes to bed.
If one day Rychtá ř was breaking with Barto ová, its wife would not wait for it at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if the rest of its life wants to live in our house, nobody will throw it".
"But here he would live not already like my dear and old donkey that was wrong, but like a man whom certain bonds join to me", said Rychtářová and added that it had already come off its husband and was insisting only on the mutual respect.
Till now it is not important for Josef that woman has closed the door of behind.
"I accept the decision of my wife".
"I will be with Iveta and there is no possible change".
"My wife established this like a marriage on the role and I respect it".
"The company continues in force, I do the house arrangements, take care of the garden, the hearth, do the buys".
"Darina and I speak to ourselves with normality, the only thing is that we do not share bed, said Rychtá ř.
If Rychtářová was finding a new love, he would not be opposed.
"We do not sleep together and I am not interested in it, where she does not even go not if it has some fiancé.
I already know that it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I assume all the responsibility", Josef concludes.
The worst vices of the women: Also do they refer to you?
If you ask the men to be capable of quoting some typical vices of the women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women: do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where there are quoted certain feminine vices that manage to make to boil the blood to the males?
To go shopping
Does he reproach him to its orange average that has dependence on the buys?
Does a trapito have to be bought at least in week?
Does he like buying often in the reductions?
Then in its case it is possible to be said that to go shopping has turned into a vice.
Some women realize that they should pacify its passion for the buys, at least a little.
But to see: what woman might resist the temptation of walking without much ado along the clothes shops, of looking for quite exact pledges and later be proved all of them in the changing room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most of the women going shopping is a pastime, for the men it can turn practically into a hell.
Only remember how many times he has already said to its couple that better he should wait for it in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am not I too fat?"
"He would need to slim at least five kilos: should it begin doing exercise?"
"Really do you like?"
Him do not these phrases sound?
To what yes?
Then she is one of these women obsessed with its aspect.
It is not that you should allow looking after, but many men are allergic to listen to its couple to complain all the time of its physical aspect.
The strong sex also agrees in that the more the frequency of the complaints increases, the more annoying become the women.
The order and the cleanliness first of all
It is like an infinite merry-go-round.
To clean the windows, to spend the hoover, to wash the soil, to dust, to wash the bathtub and all that at least two times per week.
Does he reproach its couple who has trodden on the clean soil with a dirty foot, its children who have made a newly cleaned wash-basin and shelves dirty with glass doors that so much was difficult to him to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and that the order and the cleanliness of course should not occupy to be essential in the family.
This inoffensive cleanliness desire might threaten its relations and the familiar well-being.
To make unpleasant comments
"The secondhand briefs are left by the dirty clothes."
"You want to put yourself also tomorrow these secondhand socks"
"The wet rag is not left in the soil!"
If you do these cometarios to its couple more times a day, know that this way it will manage to extract it of its pigeonholes.
Naturally. You do not mean badly at all, he wants only to achieve that everything is in order.
Perhaps, if the men knew this, the women for his part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnies and gossip
There go to some women also the calumnies, the gossip, but also the affronts and the conspiracy against someone.
The women concentrate on the relations, that's why they like speaking together about things of the guy who, where, with who, how and why.
Perhaps sometimes a small and inoffensive piece of gossip escapes from each of us.
With the hand in the heart, this is own of almost all the women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who are not controlled, which like to tattle and do it often, they despise all and turn out to be dangerous for those who surround them, especially in a feminine labor team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with its assistance to conquer Philadelphia
The forward of hockey Jaromír Jágr took part on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assistance that brought the victory on Philadelphia 5:3 in the court of Carolina and it puts the Czech players again in the avant-garde of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux made use of the move of the 39-year-old star, and gave one more step and he was declared a better player of the party.
Two assistance was awarded in the party and also the partner of Jágr, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr affirmed before the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a big night.
"Already before the party he had said to him that it would do triplete".
"It was anticipating it".
"Sometimes there look like ambushes", told Jágr, after its performance was giving a goal to Giroux, immediately after the first trallazo of the Flyers.
A little bit later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech track.
Voráček was done by the disc behind the goal of the Hurricanes and moved it between the circles up to Maxim Talbot, who scored goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr it scored the third goal, after its shot was slipping in for the quarter of the goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him".
"I do not mean that he is the best player of the court, but undoubtedly it is between the best three", he considered Jágr to its head office.
"It would never have happened to me that at the end of my career it was going to play with a sportsman like him".
"I am much satisfied of it".
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my partners were playing for me, and that now produces results", adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and after new of Dwyer, of penalty, up to putting itself to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they finished overcome in number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field".
"It cleared the disc, I took speed and Read went away towards the most remote part".
"I tried to succeed in finding him to the disc and I am satisfied because I obtained it", Voráček was describing the last goal of the party as he lived through it.
Engañe su victoria, Filadelfia se ah puesto en cabeza de la Conferencia Este.
The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav Š paček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third it moved back for an injury in the top part of the body.
Not only a player lost the Canadiens with a lot of experience in defense, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomá Plekanec could not make use of one of the shots.
More about that the points lost to the local trainer the large number of injured persons was sorry in the last line, and to play the alone party with five defenses.
"That is bad".
"We play the alone party with a veteran player, the rest they were new".
"Anyway, but the fact is that against that it is not possible to do anything, we have to fight with it", said Jacques Martin.
"So much to rotate the players turned against us, we could not resist it".
"We had to simplify even more the game, extract the disc of our field".
"And this way we leave hollows", told one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who made end like that to a series of defeats that five parties already lasted.
How have the prices of the trips evolved from 1989
Until 1989 there were in the Czechoslovakia of then only five authorized state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that moment were selling in most cases travel only to the socialistic block, since the trips to Occident were very restricted.
The Czech tourists were going, therefore, of holidays to the beaches of the RDA (German DR), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period understood between 1962 and 1972, when the Yugoslavian diet one could travel to Yugoslavia, nevertheless, later he inclined towards the west and the trips of the Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A big paradox of the socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialistic block (or, also to the Checoeslovacos) were not allowed to travel free and individually not even for the socialistic countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
The agencies of trip were offering in those times also trips to the West, but one had to put himself to the tail with a sleeping bag and spend this way the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Nevertheless not everything was gained.
The called "promise of change" that was the condition for the trips to the West, was not granting the "people to itself politically slightly trustworthy", that this way could not travel by no means.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a currency freely convertible and, without change guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to Occident.
The majority of the Czechs was spending its holidays in its own country, therefore there was a big number of huts and summer houses, which the Czechs were acquiring. This custom still persists.
The way of traveling from the Czechs has suffered from 1989 an authentic revolution.
While until 1989 for us it was the va more to spend the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs did 4,5 million trips of holidays to countries of the whole world.
It turns out to be nna a big paradox, of which today we are already not conscious, the fact that at present favorite, Croatia, until 1989 it was not possible to travel to the destination freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of then.
At the beginning of the 90s the visas exemption was imposed to travel to the nearby States of western Europe, what provoked an enormous wave of visits of short duration, topcoat to Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, for the long time, were not turning out to be full of the excursions on the West, everybody wanted to see it to less for a moment.
For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs were sleeping in the parks in tents, since our income of then was not allowing us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take with it the meal (conserves, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, like that our tourists could, after decades, buy finally freely western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with him also the average wages, what about 1997 provoked an increase in the trips demand.
With the increase of the demand of trips they began the agencies, from 1997 regularly, to prepare the trips using the charter flights connections, what made lower incredibly the prices of the trips compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the passengers volume.
At the end of the 90 of last century, already the Czechs were traveling without visa to almost all the developed country, except the USA, which simplified even more our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of the pos-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when the first direct flight was organized, thanks to an enormous demand, from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
From that year, they divide every year direct charter flights with Czech tourists it was doing distant and warm countries. This winter it will fly away already straight from Czechia to 12 exotic destinations.
Nearly 100 thousand Czechs visit the exotic countries at present a year.
Another interesting moment of this epoch, which symbolizes our pos-revolutionary development, came in the year 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA eliminated the visas for the Czech tourists, with what our country happened to be between the most developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of its holidays abroad (50,3 %) and for the first time in its history, more than 15 thousand Czech crowns have worn out in travels abroad for head, including the expenses in the stay place.
Summoned Ordinary General Assembly to choose the president, who might finish again exactly died.
For almost five months the Czech soccer is without president and it is probable that Ivan's successor Is ek like President of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAÈR), it will not be known not after the call of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that it will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, one still has not come to an agreement on the rules of voting to be continued.
Without the same ones, it will not be possible to vote even to choose between three candidates.
The interested parties to preside at the Czech soccer are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta y Tomá Paclík.
There is ek there resigned from its charge in June not without earlier summoning its companions with the intention of finding a strong person who could deal with the soccer in the future.
Nevertheless, after concluding the age, There is ek, a common candidate untied a controversy between two federations of the association unable to come to an agreement to choose.
It stayed in evidence on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), placed in the quarter praguense of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not only as for the election method.
It did not go over to any consensus not as for whom in the General Assembly he was having a right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From this moment and due to this only point, there took place a partial agreement endorsed also by the recommendation of the Institute of the State and Right, according to which the representation for full powers is not possible.
Nevertheless, the disputes on the electoral code are still open.
Any more light on the situation could already throw not even the Executive board that, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The opinion about the possibility of voting has already changed a pair of times, but the neuralgic point keeps on being the same.
The question is the following one: of what way to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute turns if it is necessary to proceed in accordance with the articles of association or to find another model", says Du an Svoboda, one of three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents the professional soccer.
According to the model proposed in the articles of association, in the third round there will win that candidate who has major percentage of support in the federation to which it will present its candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is ready to come to a commitment so that that candidate could win with a major entire percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian part, nevertheless, imposes the condition of which the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have most of at least two thirds.
"This would take, nevertheless, the sense from him to the two previous rounds and would deny completely the concept of bicameral system", this way it is as Svoboda understands the objections of the part morava, according to which the best thing would be not to touch the order and to vote according to the applicable articles of association.
With the above mentioned, surprisingly, Capture agrees also Paclík, although it is supposed that the electoral regulation established by the articles of association of all the candidates is convenient more for Pelta.
"I would like that it was voted to the maximum in accordance with the articles of association".
"So that no foolery should be invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly", says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is postulated for the first time like candidate and who directs its remarks principally against Pelta.
Pelta keeps on being an optimist.
According to him, in Nymburk he will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future were cooperating in a constructive way.
"All the passions will calm down with the today party of our national team in the European Championship.
"The soccer will be a protagonist again, and this way one will cooperate more to taste" the representative of the Jablonice affirms, that of three candidates it has more experience in management of the soccer, so much at a professional level as regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that one comes to an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not a question of the conflict between Bohemians and moravos, but there are attempts of fitting the rules to their own expediency."
"This can have as a result a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyhow, I hope that the common sense will be imposed", said Rajchl.
It does not stay already a lot of time so that all the parts come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be realized in Montenegro, but: who can know until it begins the party if the team of soccer will be finished?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, between others vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera y Rajchl, has not gone out this morning for technical problems in Prague, an alternative having to be looked to transport to part of the executive board to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, might be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, as they tell, will be celebrated this Wednesday.
To Josef Dobe, Education Secretary, Juventud and Sports, it would like incorporating very much to the parts divided to the most powerful sports organization of the country so that one comes to an agreement.
There is greatly in game: the state subsidies, the credibility of the soccer and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the Czechoslovakian federation of the sport (ÈSTV) that it will try to provide with a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of lotteries Sazka.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because a more suitable candidate does not find.
If the chief of the soccer players of Pilsen, Capture Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who should satisfy all its ideas on the new president of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAÈR), he would not even present himself as a candidate for such an excellent position.
"If there was a suitable person, it would be fighting for her and would not present itself as a candidate for the elections."
"But up to today it was not possible to have found a person like that", said Paclík for the Czech News agency (ÈTK)
What motivates Paclík to be brought in in the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAÈR).
Paclík also specifies that, in case to win, would remain in the charge of alone president until 2013, when there would come the shift of the ordinary General Assembly.
In this charge he would like seeing an expert and good manager who is not too related to the soccer events.
"I have already spoken with some persons whom it might bear in mind".
"For me it was a madness to hear some saying that in this moment at least they want to be identified by the Czech soccer."
"I would like changing this vision", he adds.
What supposedly more annoying to Paclík in this moment is the Pelta relation with the President of the Association of Regional Soccer of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past known as the world like a powerful lobista with aptitude to influence the voting of the delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see seated Pelta in the presidential armchair.
"In case it wins, the current status would be supported and nothing in the soccer will change".
"With the Berbra support, an ambitious businessman, the soccer will extract still less profit", said Paclík.
It mentions also the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta went out unpunished.
"I do not know what prestige to the soccer might bring the Pelta victory."
"And with what eyes will it look for us at the UEFA and the FIFA", said Paclík, which also takes with certain precaution its previous declaration that "would sell the Club Pilsen if Pelta turns into president".
In case of gaining the Thursdays elections, Paclík might raise the cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion he is another candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly of September that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one whom he would follow".
"It is very capable."
"One might imagine it, for example, like chief of the representation".
"but not like manager of an association".
"I do not also put the nostril there where I do not feel capable", added Paclík, which in September caused a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Commission of Umpires presided by Ludek Macel, replaced later with Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that it would dare to manage the association.
It resorts to its capacities of management of the private enterprises, since from last summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who with its support celebrated in May the victory in first division.
"I have force to change some things into the soccer ambience and to contribute to its sure practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbies, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and of appeal, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding its antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínsk ý.
One of the priorities also would be that of consolidating the relation between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic committee, with the help of which he was exercising pressure on the political leaders so that they destine more money to the sport of the taxes of the lottery.
"It is one of the key problems to which it would be necessary to dedicate the new president."
"If the taxes will increase on the gambling games, as the political parties announce it, it would support its arguments, but, frankly, they have to say to us that adónde it is going to stop all this money", it points out.
You prop, Paclík now does not bear in mind even its association with the Club Pilsner, although he affirms himself that the President of the FAČR must be "a not supporter".
Pelta is associated in turn with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"But I do not see sense to the fact of transferring hypocritically my actions of the Club of Pilsen to another person then to return there after one year and a half", said Paclík.
Pelta promised to the FAČR new articles of association that would finish with the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Soccer one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in case of being chosen, it would guarantee that the FAČR had a few new articles of association that were serving definitely to solve, in the future, the controversies as for the electoral regulation.
The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic as for the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and he believes that the pre-electoral conflict might advance towards a solution today with the possible victory of the team of soccer.
Already before the elections not realized in September, Pelta promised to center, in case of being chosen, precisely on the representation and in collecting funds.
He decided to take part in last minute in the last General Assembly, therefore he might be this postponement of two months fine to defend and to present, in a wider context, its ideas on the management of the soccer.
"The people of all the levels deal already with the soccer long ago and hope to meet this Thursday the new President."
"They feel that the hour has come from that someone manages the association", thinks the man who collaborates principally with the Club of Jablonice, but who was employed at the Sparta and at the executive board of the Association.

He is sure that behind the current problems with the elections there is the euphoria that was reigning in the epoch of Ivan Ha ek.
"Regrettably, in the General Assembly of June there were approved the articles of association that were not so perfect as they all were thinking."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we already have a president from September", warned Pelta.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used like decoy to be gained the delegates.
"If they choose me president, I will take it like a personal challenge and I am ready to answer in case this should fail."
"It is a question of beginning, without which we cannot exist", says Pelta.
Also, theoretically, it tries not to get with its opponents.
Already in the past it had warned that one saw collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for its formation in Right, realizing that its opponent would be also its first vice-president.
It was already taking a lot of time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave marionette with head.
"It takes more than one year in the soccer world, and it has already achieved some successes."
"Its attacks but they were shameful and many people remained surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt on its real character", he said to its opponent Pelta, who keeps on being faithful to the declarations announced already in September.
Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, its knowledge of the soccer, from the lowest competitions up to the Superiors.
The last one should be a shop window of promotion of the soccer.
"Also, it would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result from the scandal of corruption of last year."
"Immediately later I would interfere in the negotiations with the public sector and the private one, to assure that there should be enough money for all the soccer", said two months ago to the ČTK the 46-year-old candidate.
Next also it promised that its appointment as president of the soccer would not endure any personal modification of the staff.
"It would have to know first the tasks of every employee", he said referring to Strahov where, after a long lawlessness period, an understandable nervousness reigns.
In spite of the current catastrophic stages that are predicted before the next General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only disagreement point will be how to vote in the third round, undoubtedly we will manage to overcome it.
"The soccer needs credibility, which will recover only if finally it has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta keeps on being an optimist.
Rajchl promises, that under its leadership, the FAČR would begin working with desire.
If in the fourth General Assembly current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl goes out elected as new president of the Czech Association of Soccer, many people would prove to be of course spiteful.
Rajchl promises that, in case of being chosen, one would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematical change and do that the members of the executive board are responsible for every area of the soccer individually.
Also he promises to solve the case of the Bohemians, improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, obtain more money for the soccer and continue with the work initiated by the previous president Ivan, There is ek.
"Like president, I would like devoting myself completely to the soccer".
"From the international contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA up to the selection, happening for the professional soccer or the training of young soccer players of high performance."
"With this I do not mean that it would make it quite alone", said Rajchl in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competitions of the executive board in such a way that every member could devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that the soccer could, in each of these segments, go forward with very much impulse".
"Many people probably will not like this, because it will mean to begin working very hard and not only criticize the work of the others", it added.
Due to the criticism ambience in the soccer movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not presenting itself again as a candidate.
"They all know, that I work 20 daily hours."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will not be the people behind me who will prevent me and will hinder to every step", he told this way the motives of its indecision.
"Many people have said to me that I must not give up, because then the others would give up also".
"It is a question of having faith not to retire this way, without much ado", he said.
As they say, he is motivated also to continue the work that started already with Ha ek.
"During these two years, there ended a big part of the work that I do not want that now it gets lost".
"There exist processes that had been begun and that will have its effect inside a pair of years and I would not like that anybody stops them", he announced worried by the fact that, if they should choose another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association might be like again it was before the epoch of Ha ek.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not capable of maintaining.
"Behind him there are especially all those people who would deal with the soccer so that a privilege was alone for a few elected ones."
"A heap of things one can reproach me, but not the fact that I am in favor of someone."
"Attempt to be a target."
"I want to do a soccer for all, because only this way they all will feel good and not only elected", said Rajchl.
It pushes back also the idea that alone would be Bohemian the president.
"Although some persons try to affirm the opposite, I have in mind to do the maximum thing for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division in a Czech part and in another morava, whose winners would go to the first division".
"The current situation would not happen in the one that we have alone three teams of Moravia, what represents a problem for the players moravos young", said Rajchl.
Although to the battle of the presidential elections there added Capture Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl does not stop believing in its possibilities of being elected.
"I am still sorry to have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and which knows that behind me there are clear successes", said Rajchl, whose successes comprise the saving of a few tens million crowns of disadvantageous contracts, the negotiations of television contracts and the negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, he admits its part of fault in which the federation should not be close.
And while proclamation that Pelta "it is discredited to recover the confidence in the Czech soccer", thinks another rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who yes has something that to offer to the soccer.
"Nobody can deny that it did a big work for the Pilsen that year".
"In case it should be chosen, probably it will continue what there already began Ivan Ha ek and it would not change in a significant way the staff of the personnel into the committees."
"I do not want to use that in my favor", he evaluates this way its rivals Rajchl.
The nicest swimming pools of Europe
I jump to the blue
por Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible optics, sumptuous baths in Budapest: The one who visits Europe can live through its blue marvel, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest its legs tired in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder realized an investigation trip during last year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in its baggage, a swimsuit.
Knocked down of backs on the water, it was looking at the artistic dome on top, was swimming towards the marble cherubs, which were waiting for it in the rim of the swimming pool and was astonished before the modernist covered swimming pool restored meticulously.
He liked the bath, was taking note in its notebook at the moment of all the interesting details on the style and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools this way and it presents them in its recent book "Badefreuden": the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historical palaces of the bath in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
It realized its "trip for the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" for 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of the culture of the bath.
He does not want to have anything in common with the sport, says Meder, only the water is different.
Only it bothers him that the fans of the bath have to be content with blue tiles and stench to chlorine, while the fans to be covered can breathe the fascinating smell of the forests of firs or listen to the happy warbles of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the swimming pools have always to be so ugly", affirms this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I began to collect nice swimming pools."
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The splash in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The well-being factor in the swimming pools is so big because they attend to all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strains, the covered swimming pools can be a real gift for the sight: "Instead of soil, in the baths a water surface is had."
"On one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colors, the springboards.
The book with photos in small format "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages very interesting information on the architecture and the art history in the historical oases of the well-being, but, principally, it gives desire of jumping to the blue.
Meder, the swimming pools collector discovers the copies emphasized in its investigations in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths like the bath of Széchenyi of Budapest, of 100 years, the waters meet nitrates in a singular cavity kárstica (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a few spa, which swimming pools are of alkaline waters and meet in a building form of bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular conference: While the whole city puts the eyes in the roofed swimming pool of Zurick, it is possible to look at Arlberb covered of snow, from the exterior swimming pool of a bath in St. Anthony, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which it is possible to observe the practice in the ski tracks.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary waits for the clients in Längenfeld: The cathedral of the water of Ötztal looks like an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
Of three open sources it raises steam in winter, while of fund the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
To Meder, the collector of swimming pools, it was not invading the smell of chlorine in all the swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell to sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the pest to diesel oil is so strong that the people are thinking about having come to a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and which slime sticks to the skin on having entered the swimming pool, an enjoyment of the well-being of a special way.
Iris Meder also was disappointed in a place in its search of nice places for the bath, when he wanted to visit open swimming pools and baths of the sun in the Czech Luhatschowitz bath, met a blocked area.
The bath of 1902 of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked across dilapidated at windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, it saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
The decline was resisting in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three construction phases after themselves; not only elements can be discovered neorománicos of times of its construction in 1844, if not also an Arab entrance hall of style Alhambra, added in 1900.
From its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because he is a native of the Black Forest.
"It has merit great to fuse different architectural styles in such a fantastic unit", affirms Meder.
In a palace like that the immersion in the thermal swimming pool seemingly does not have a lot of importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of the raw material
For Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank resign from its business with agricultural raw material?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has entrusted a group of work to verify the consequences of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the chief of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburgo,
For the citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, it does not seem acceptable to 84 per cent of the Germans about that the banks speculate with the agricultural raw material like the wheat or the corn.
Two thirds of the interrogated persons claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions move back from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest of the world.
This is the result of a survey for order of the consumer society Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch in the middle of October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the bags of global raw material make raise the prices, and the banks load with the responsibility of the world problem of the famine.
The campaign of the defender of the consumer speaks in particular to Josef Ackermann, the director of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similar.
Originally, the bets on raw material were thought to protect the merchants of the oscillations of the prices.
The main experts agree in that the players have been uncoupled of the offers and demands, and extract profit of the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism of different form that the American competitors: It promised to check the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information of ON-LINE SPIEGEL, a group of international work is checking the claims of the report of Foodwatch.
The analysis must be finished at the end of year, then the results will appear to the board of Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation of how handling the matter.
At the end of January, the direction of the bank will report of the consequences.
In the end there might happen a reduction of the business of the raw material, or enclosed its entire abandonment.
Ackermann intenta arreglar su imagen.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but he reaffirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "The bets at increasing food prices show of way especially drastic how the merciless banks harm at present the public well-being."
Ackermann is like the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must annul all the investments of its portfolio in those that the money puts in game for bets of food prices", affirmed Bode.
"It does not matter if Ackermann treats the topic of the people who spends famine or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The Ackermann examination turns out to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the chief of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving its position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the president of the directorate will change something different from not planned into the council of administration.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation he can perfect its image.
And he needs that scarcely possible losses matter for him, with that its successor will deal.
Two thirds would annul the investment in raw material
Foodwatch strains in keeping the pressure high on the manager.
Until now, more than 30.000 Net users have taken part in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa had asked 1.001 persons on November 7 and 8.
Scarcely 10 per cent considered to be legitimate that Deutsche Bank should offer investments in those who were betting the prices of the food.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences on having discovered that its bank was taking part in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would annul all the investments of which there goes out money of the agrarian speculation.
43 per cent would dissuade a bank like that to its acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after reflecting, annulling its account and would change to another institute.
The house 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
For Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture history with ups and downs and a happy end, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 obtained awards, it was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and crumbled.
Now it is re-opened like exhibitions house.
The architecture of modern postgerra excites, the clear forms, the entrance halls of crystal, the brave curves and the new building materials typical of the thought on the technical progress, for what, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer obtained then the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction considers up to the actuality a contemporary milestone of the architecture.
It did the architect so well-known that also he constructed the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW more the adjacent building smoothed in Munich, he happened to be internationally an acquaintance.
Its pavilion designed like a temporary construction for exhibitions got up after the universal exhibition in Schweizer Garten along with the station of the south of Vienna, reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, it was called the "house 20".
The building was adapted but he was lacking the spaces and technology adapted for a museum; without any wall to hang art, not a good ambience.
In spite of it it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new hearth.
The building is empty from 2001 and droops increasingly.
At present, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now it calls it "a house 21" and it will be used in the future as contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday evening the museum was inaugurated belvedere, to that the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the gallery belvedere Austrian from 2007, achieved a renewal.
Husslein-Arco, doctor of art history with a considerable career, between other things, artistic skater on ice in its youth, later in Sotheby, the museum Guggenheim and governing founder of the modern art museum of Salzburg, realized the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.
With the exception of the contemporary art, there are exhibited the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation homónima, there should be a snack bar and a bookstore and also construct him an office block.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best election to do it.
Not only because it reformed in a sensitive way the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, it extended it and the contest was awarded, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and immense place", in which he was contemplating "almost all the weekends" the exhibitions.
It knew the project and the problem of the building, which eliminated with its transfer Vienna in its change of use with generosity and facility.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "a devourer of energy", said Krischanitz.
There changed the profile of the windows of the crystal front, the crystal roof installed to itself an insulating crystal reinforced with fiberglass and remplazó for a crystal of special safety.
The thermal bridges and the beams of steel were reinforced or remplazaron and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two cellars were used for the new use, a panel of light lowered between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is identical with ancient tones mahogany and protected against the oxidation.
And the movies room is exactly as it was earlier.
And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a low budget.
"Often it had to find material that was good, cheap and also it will please to the monuments protection office", affirms Krischanitz and warns of a rough soil in the cellar.
In spite of all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building stays flexible and light.
It of the pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, affirmed not long ago Krischanitz, a typical "chance appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture like that is "always in the wrong place" and that's why he wanted "to wake up the suitable conscience".
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, a town-planning stroke of luck has happened. The completely new one and planned "quarter of the base station", with housings and offices, is along with Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: The house 21 might receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of Berlin temporary art and, as it is heard, he negotiates with the city on a nearby place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a bundle of winter crisis that amounts to millions
The company has designed a plan of crisis, which would avoid the breakdowns of the trains in winter.
The number of personnel must double.
What costs millions.
In the struggle against the breakdowns and debts of the trains caused in the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent in this year more than 70 million euros, according to a journalistic reportage.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal plan of crisis of the group, of the investments foreseen until 2005 of a whole of about 300 million euros.
For what it is still necessary to obtain a better availability of the vehicles and of the railroad network with an extreme time.
Between other things, it is planned to turn the internal and external personnel to 16.000 positions to withdraw the snow of the routes and of the platforms.
The target is to clean the platforms of snow and ice for the functioning and 90 per cent of the needles necessary for the functioning within a period of four at five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and debts in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and the industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the travelers' transport, since, between other things, he lacked reservations before adverse meteorological conditions.
Many new regional trains take years waiting for an authorization of the railroad federal bureau.
Also there is a delay in the delivery of the trains of high speed.
Deutsche Bahn works from years in verifying the axes of the trains of high speed often in the workshop, after a train of high speed was suffering the break of an axis at the base station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the USA.
After the tumult on the president Josef Ackerman, a new problem of the USA appears, Deutsche Bank must pay there a millionaire fine.
As if the problems were not sufficient for Deutche Bank, its past in the USA acquires the giant of the sector, the Institute of Frankfurt pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to finish the contests due to the failure of five big cooperatives of credit during the financial crisis.
It is a question of the sale of mortgage qualifications.
The regulatory one of financial markets NCUA reproaches to many big banks to induce to the credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such qualifications lost its value during the financial crisis and they drag to the banks to the depths.
"We are satisfied of being able to clarify the topic without the parts having to come to the courts", said a spokesman of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also is applied to Citigroup, which forced a payment for 20,5 million dollars.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the credit cooperatives of the USA and she gives support in case of failure to protect the clients' investments.
The NCUA tries to restore the caused losses of millions.
The agreements at present closed are its first type.
The regulator also had asked for accounts to other big banks and in begun summer suits against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of the doubtful mortgage qualifications, they talk each other of the called values endorsed by mortgages.
These base on credits housing.
When the real estate bubble of the USA exploded in 2007, it led to the perdition to many financial institutions.
In September, 2008, in the icy point of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened some years ago, at present there blows a wind complicated for the American banks.
The investors and the examination have begun countless processes to receive indemnifications or to sanction absences.
The Federal Agency of Financing of Housing (FHFA in its initials in English) has produced the biggest demands quantity.
He reproaches to 18 big international banks of that two American state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made use of the business of the mortgages in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Also Deutsche Bank has a demand of the FHFA, talks each other business at the price of 14,2 billion dollars of the year 2005 to 2007.
The examination demands that the Institute of Frankfurt should answer of "the substantial losses", without naming an exact number.
Deutsche Bank pushed the debts back like groundless and told that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes with 10 billions to IBM
The guru of the finance, Buffett, invests strongly in the company of Information technologies IBM.
From March he has acquired actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
Till now the big American investor Warren Buffett has always declared to invest neither in companies of computers nor Information technologies since the prognoses of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But he has read the commercial IBM report and changed its opinion on investing in the sector.
It should have understood very much before IBM it offers especially services and tries computers systems for the departments of Information technologies of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be an honor.
Therefore, the Information technologies primitive one must call "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed at present in the broadcasting station of economy CNBC that has acquired actions of IBM for a value of 10,7 thousands of million dollars from March.
Its investments Berkshire Hathaway has promoted with it one of the biggest shareholders of IBM with a participation of 5,5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM did not know till now anything of the commitment.
It praised to the direction that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They have done a brilliant work", affirmed Buffett on the strategy.
IBM established for some time the lucrative services of Information technologies as the functioning of computer centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful teams for companies.
Buffett avoided the companies of technology up to the date.
He said that only he was investing in companies which business it was understanding.
On the contrary, Buffett made the most of the opportunity in a train of goods, in a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway possesses close to approximately 80 proper branches, as well as part of the whole series of big consortiums like Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, of 81 years, took charge of the textile small enterprise Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and, with wise investments, it extended it up to turning it into one of the most valuable companies of the world.
Nevertheless, its life style is humble.
That's why it is an idol for innumerable investors of the whole world.
Its rapid and infallible sense to gain money has provided to him the by-name of "oracle of Omaha".
After discovering the investment of Buffett, the actions of IBM in bag, they raised an one per cent.
"The blue giant", as one knows to IBM, has a value in bag of more than 220 billion dollars and appears, together with Apple and Microsoft, between the most valuable companies of technology of the world.
No engañe Microsoft, afirmó Buffett, ningún quiere colaborar.
Bill Gates, its founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat materializes
After the discovery of "the cell of Zwickau", the Turkish mass media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper speaks about a "bloody ideology" that returns to reavivarse.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between the year 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin one has reacted fearfully and worry before this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin it returns a bogey that was considered dead some time ago, from the offenses with form of fires in Mölln in November, 1992 and in Solingen in May, 1993, any more violence episodes had not happened with background of extreme right against Turks.
Nevertheless, one has never questioned that in Germany xenophobia exists.
The network extreme right-winger discovered reveals a magnitude which dimensions were not, not much less, foreseeable.
"Does it turn to reavivarse the bloody ideology?", it titles the edition for Internet of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights on the contrary that one of the authors of the crime was an informant of the Federal bureau of Defense of the Constitution and extreme right-winger proves to be worried why the German authorities can be involved in the marshland.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted reasonably, the weekend remembered the victims of the racist violence with a wakefulness before the Door of Brandenburgo.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German and Turkish politicians Turk - German reflected in a solemn act of fifty on anniversary of the agreement.
The coexistence put itself in scene with happy colors, like a history with happy end.
The information came to some Turkish means like a slap: "The German gift for fifty anniversary", he says the title of an article in the Turkish platform of Internet "Credit X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German emission "Hürriyet" does not insist on planning this mental connection either.
"It begins to smell badly", he says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It highlights that the murdered ones were persons who were paying its taxes and they did an important contribution with its work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Germans' Internet forums of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its later success in the searches they are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that suspects have not looked for the German authorities very much earlier in the circle of the ultraright one.
Someone proves to be the less rhetorical as for the drastic means: "From now on here it gets lost, the immigrants have left the only the self-defense and the armament".
"This will be the best self-defense".
"The internal peace of Germany depends hard on the quality of the clarification and of the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network"., writes "Selen".
What means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the offenses of Mölln and Solingen will clear up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been recorded in the German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that the suspicion and the distance can end in the violence.
The attacks sharpen the feeling of group of the Turkish part.
Not to repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press there was criticized then principally the shortcoming of the German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the Mölln survivors.
After the offense with form of fire of Solingen he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, its Secretary of State, replaced it in the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in its speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with the taxes.
It remains clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its taxes.
The current information of the Turkish means shows it again deep that is, since then, the suspicion of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a wide explanation and of a revaluation of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, this time frank words need.
The bank of the scandal of the lake of Zurick
The riskiest bank of Europe is neither in Italy nor France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost entered bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then one slid of a crisis the following one.
Now German directs it.
It was sure that Axel Weber had not thought it.
After its spectacular game of the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 it would begin in a new one and almost the same way of spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in its career.
Axel Weber is glad publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and to the UBS for its newly acquired soundness and drops kind remarks on its future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization".
"It makes me happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
In September it remained clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the safety systems of the bank and defrauded 1,7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director-general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the administrative council of the USB was considered to be since then the same way touched, and they all asked: When does Axel Weber come?
It was known that Weber will have to advise to the bank from February, 2012.
And he will take charge of the presidency of the administrative advice in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
Banker is not, rather, a teacher of economy and an adviser and it has had an adaptation period of course necessary.
Suddenly he becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has proves just again that there deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal of Europe" for time.
On one hand, the USB is enormous, till not long ago he was the biggest world manager of goods, and on the other hand, for years, one slides of a scandal the following one.
Not at all, this way it it seems, so proud Swiss bank saves itself him to formerly.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the manager of goods discreet and solid Swiss, but also clever, got together with ambitious targets, also he wanted to be a big number in the investment banks.
On one hand, with 1,6 trillion dollars, the USB manages more money of wealthy clients than any other bank of the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced like investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the ancient banker and later teacher of banking in Zurick for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as shape of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How might I be wrong?"
It was in a big error.
In the year 2007 it went out to the light that something went out very badly in the USB.
In the middle of year, Peter Wuffli, director-general, who till then was considered to be a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The fund of investments of the bank embarked in losses with qualifications of high risk and had to amortize thousands of millions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of neither more nor less than of 13 billion Francs.
For this it thought investors, naturally that some of them were looking contemptuously up to little earlier: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and Arab, so discreet state fund, that its name had never been heard.
This one was alone the first blow.
In April, 2008, it deteriorated.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative advice, in 2006 in the second best full administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October, 2008, it continued the catastrophe, considering its wrong investments, the UBS was in the financial crisis before the failure and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many thousands of millions, the Swiss Confederacy gave six thousands of million Francs for an obligatorily convertible bond, by means of which it was turning into co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was affected, one affirmed the dramatic thing that was this for a small country, if it lodges to so big banks.
Finally the sum of the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more of five times major than the economic results of Switzerland (to see graphic).
"We cannot rescue the UBS again", said Geiger, expert in banking.
The second one joined the first catastrophe.
A few months later, the UBS came to terms in a fiscal conflict with America and proved to be ready to deliver the information of the wealthy clients, which possibly taxes had defrauded with help of the bank.
Also, it approves a number of 780 thousands of million dollars, refund of unjustified benefits of this business with an indemnification for payment.
With it, the UBS confessed to have helped more or less in the tax evasion.
Simultaneously it lost something that had been for ages its capital in the competition for rich clients: the tact aureole.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is already not the same.
To this it continued the resignation of the president of the directorate and of the president of the administrative advice.
And the exodus of the funds of the clients.
This way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investments banking by means of the erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods by means of the help to the tax evasion.
And I joust when I was slightly calmer, just again when it was thought that the UBS was obtaining it again, this unhappy history of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1,7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was going badly.
And this was revealed, evidently, it does not work yet well with the risk management in the investments banking.
"With the case Adoboli one shows that the risk control panel has changed too many little", affirms Martin Janssen, teacher of economy and finance in the Bank Institute of the University of Zurick.
The financial director of a big German bank also is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the risk control panel".
Therefore there arose the idea of the precaution, with which the Swiss bankers were presenting before themselves for time, to be the guards of the biggest goods of the world: no too big risk, on the other hand, the safety of the money wants to fail to another side of the Alpine republic.
The safety deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unbreakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The head office of the UBS in Zurick does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little major.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main head office in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurick, which goes from the base station straight to the lake of Zurick, framed by the covered summits of snow of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest of Europe.
Here jewelry shops are like Tiffany`s between Swiss traditional business like the confectionery Sprüngli.
Here the Swiss banks reside for years: from the national bank, happening for the palace of Credit Suisse, up to the elitarios banks deprived like Julius Bär.
One enters the room of reception of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, ahead are big leather armchairs, along with the logo of the bank there is a big sign to indicate the "safety".
The UBS knows for what the client looks here: Safety.
Two big Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, in some moment have displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as thinks the president of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read its name in the newspaper, after all it does, like all the Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, thinks, principally in the banking of investments, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained area.
There the Swiss did not have anything more that to say.
"And they have got accustomed for the long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investments banking, delivered its first big profit and then the disaster came, no European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk like the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was clear.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven millions decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in its book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
The politicians granted up to 68 thousands of million Francs or approximately 45 thousands of million euros to save to the big bank of the bankruptcy.
How does it occur to them?
One speaks with the Swiss bankers, this way they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June, 1998, two of three big Swiss banks fuse in a powerful consortium.
There arises a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and keeps on growing.
Therefore it served so that two different banks precursors of the UBS were complementing each other: a rich but asleep bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurick and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came in an opportune way with a lot of money, with which they could make to roll a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this increase of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, chief of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, president of that time of the administrative advice.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team", says the expert in banking Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest one, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one that managed to make way from learning in the bank up to the summit."
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli committed probably a decisive error: "He thought that its models were a reality", says Geiger.
"It is a tragic case."
Tragic actor, perhaps.
It is clear: The mistake came before the case.
The personnel of the UBS remembers clearly the managers' meetings, in which Wuffli, the chief of the consortium, was always repeating the same motto: To lower of the throne Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
They were heading the "League Tables", the classifications that then were documenting the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be in the summit.
Some steps went out for him well.
In the operations of currencies and in the negotiation of actions it was in the highest thing.
Nevertheless, the in charge advisers of companies emphasized a weak point: In the business of the international interest, in the language of banking "fixed he uneats", there is an enormous indemnification for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost costs him its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested so much the same bank like one of its funds of high risk created in American investments of high risk.
It transformed into a powerful machine for titularizar American mortgage credits and to sell them next, maintaining certain risks on account proper.
And also, how other banks did he look for the descent for the long time.
"In summer 2007, since the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there", said Geiger, expert in banking.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to go away, since the attempt of ordering turned out to be more complicated of for what they were waiting.
The positions in the UBS turned into seats proyectables and they are insecure up to the actuality.
At present, who directs a big bank, has an almost impossible work.
It must find a strategy for a bank, before which all the logical business models are lost.
Geiger expert in banks, has an idea, to finish the investments banking, to concentrate on the administration of goods, to return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to come that far (yet).
But the investments banking must diminish very much, it is clear at present.
On the following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, only one thought about the 51-year-old Italian - Swiss like a transitory solution, since the bank the bank separated surprisingly of its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he set on himself: It must direct in a permanent way the business of the UBS, he communicated the bank of Zurick on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to be sick to the investment bank to its state in the middle of the nineties.
It suppresses 3.500 positions.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
With what does money want to win?
These are the questions that Axel Weber does insurance to himself at present.
Until now only he says that first he will look for a housing with its wife in Zurick.
The following year.
The fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the American bag

What created skepticism between the American investors: "We are not an island, if not clerks", said Steve Goldman de Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be liberated so quickly of a recession, also there are more weakness signs in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of the investments, only confirmed this precaution, it is not yet clear if Europe is the sufficiently strong thing to do everything necessary to finish the crisis, affirmed in an interview for the CNBC.
That's why, from its point of view it is too prompt to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead of that, it throws for the hut a decade of old beginning and enters the American technological sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the quotation of the actions of the traditional consortium and makes her quote against the tendency on the market at first scarcely a higher percentage.

Intelligent rooks spread in the cities
In many places the rooks are considered to be "problematic birds": there are not expelled these most intelligent animals of the cities for the long time, affirm the experts.
Some like, others want to escape very rapidly from them, the rooks belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate for the filth and the noise of the animals.
Although no way has appeared against the "problematic birds" till now.
The rooks do not go out already of the cities, affirm the experts in the first symposium on rooks in Reading, oriental Friesland.
There the specialists of the whole national territory discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
The ecologists attribute the problems of the cities to the migration of the field of certain protected rooks; the chemical applications in the agriculture finish visibly with the traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, the increasing building and the fall of trees that lodge them make the life of the birds difficult.
The rooks are protected.
There are big colonies with more than 600 reproductive couples in Soest, Westfalia, between others, in the northwest, between others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Reading.
There in 2005 a controversial project jumped to the negative holders of the press to kill in mass to the rooks of the district.
The critics have qualified the hunting of the animals by means of pitfalls for birds and the murder with sticks as especially brutally.
"Expelling them and banishing them in a normal way nothing is obtained" Werner Klöver showed, urbanista and landscape painter of Reading.
To shoot with water to the nests or to throw the trees are usually not wished consequences, affirms also Manfred Kaiser, expert in environment of Lahr, Baden-Wurttemberg.
"The animals turn aside, the big dividen colonies and distribute in other places."
To banish them only is imaginable like exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we already do not catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, thinks Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Reading.
A combination is possible of banishing the animals of sensitive residential areas and baits so that they settle again in other places.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist does publicity in against in order to that one treats the animals of a completely different form: "The best thing is that we can bear a peak in the face with composure."
Jürgens cofounded in Schleswig-Holstein the education circuit on the rooks of Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by the tourists.
Jürgens also takes its own opinion about the criticism as the noise of the birds: "All sound forms of communication, they have much that to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only schists make use of the resources to gain access to morsels, if not that make hardware to use them like resources.
Recently, ethologists of the University of Cambridge verified in four rooks up to where the intelligence of the birds comes.
In an experiment, the birds learned with rapidity that they had to drop a stone on a platform this way to reach a moth larva.
Without very much training, they recognized with determination the size and the form that had to have the stone to fall down on the platform.
In the second essay, the crafty rooks had to solve a complicated problem.
The investigators placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not come to its detainee with the peak.
But the investigators left a wire piece to them.
With that four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the knob of the pipe.
Three of the cuatros rooks obtained it in the first attempt.

Massacre at personal level
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate history about the First World war, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the type that can do that to one him the soul falls down to the feet.
Are here some councils of performance: Start gently this page and her turn into its mark pages.
It will go so far as to meet very well these persons in the novelistic story of mister Englund, and this dramatis personae will work like its GPS, a lighthouse during these a few moments in which, like one of its men and women, he is confused and abandoned in the fog of the war.
Mister Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
Also he is the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which the Nobel Prize of Literature grants.
What he has written here is a slightly current book, which it describes, correctly, as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some notable names, important agreements or famous battles; practically there are no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what it happened, he tells, as "a book about how it happened". It treats about "feelings, impressions, experiences and the states of humor".
"The beauty and the pain of the battle "combines the experiences in times ordinary of war of more or less 20 men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, drivers of ambulance and administrative.
Some of these persons will turn into heroes.
Some of them will turn into war prisoners, or its members will lose, they will go crazy or die.
Its lives blink here like sails votivas lit in a church; the new some are added to the miscellany while others go out.
The book of mister Englund is a deviation of the books of standard history.
It is also a correction to the notion of that the First World war was only the baneful trenches war in the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" it moves of expert form across other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the oriental front, Mesopotamia, Africa of the East.
To the soldiers in this book they the beehives fall down above; one spends the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse-tse are a difficult problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
The war there floods the lives of these persons as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina who stinks to cordite.
When the gunfire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children: do you remain or flee?
Anyway: who comes?
Almost nobody understands what it is spending, not even why this war has been to fight.
"Lack of facts", observes mister Englund, "it has been refilled by guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of the conspiracy, sleep, nightmares and rumors".
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" it follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the fleet of open sea.
Its histories have been obtained in most cases of memoirs, letters and another material already published previously.
The explanations of its lives can be frightening or touching, but they are fuller of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of mister Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and of managing them with what there is.
About counting the history of a German schoolgirl he says: "Substitutes, throughout substitutes".
"Substitute of coffee, false aluminum, gum of imitation, blindfolds of role, wooden buttons."
He keeps on speaking about the meal sucedánea in Germany.
It describes "meat done from rice cooked and pressed in fat of ram (and finished off with a made false wooden bone); made tobacco of roots and peeling of dry potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There is, he observes, "837 authorized substitutes of the meat in the sausages production, 511 registered substitutes of the coffee".
Some histories are about the honor and the value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards the savagery and shows about the war: "You feel that, after everything, this is for what the men are conceived and not to sit down in armchairs with a cigaret and a whisky, the newspaper of the evening or a best seller, and to claim that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind this stuffy and trimmed front."
On the other hand a British soldier realizes that probably he will die, and that nobody will find out or it will be important for him.
"Once one resigns himself the thought of sacrificing itself, one would like thinking that it might happen in front of the public", he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar "to a reprobate being strangulated secretly".
Other remarks are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has turned increasingly into an economic competition", writes mister Englund, "a war between factories".
A new species reflects the arrival of what he calls "in the bestiary of the young century: The killer in mass eloquent and convinced ideologically with clothes of good dressmaking that he executes its butcher's shop while he is sitting behind an office".
The people behave in unforeseen ways; there is so much ignoble behavior as heroically.
Mister Englund speaks about the soldiers who tried to take actively a prostitutes' venereal disease as way of evading the service in the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this one can see the commerce of pus gonocócico, that the soldiers buy and daub with it its genitals with the hope to finish in the hospital", he writes.
"Those that are truly desperate rub it on its eyes, what often gives place to a blindness of for life."
In this translation from the Swedish done by Peter Graves, the prose of agile but not extravagant mister Englund, it is adapted perfectly to its human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to "untied exceptionally uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
The people begin asking why its leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World war often have been indirect, like The Big War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Without innovation in the front of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of integral histories.
The volume of mister Englund joins a slightly conventional pantheon.
Its book has one of the most devastating ends that I can remember in a work of not fiction.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if it had come from its book, started of between your fingers this dramatis personae page, and had burned it with a match.
After a step in false previous, an assault planned to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them taking helmets antidisturbances.
It was chosen the night from Monday until Tuesday because the park Zuccotti would be more empty.
The operation stayed secretly safe for a few officials of high status, saying initially to the others that they were joining an exercise.
The inspector of police officer Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, its presence was underlining how the operation was becoming infested with challenges for the police officer department.
There could not recur the episodes of recent weeks, like the pulverization of spray pepper on the demonstrators, infringing the norms of the department and creating a thunderstorm of public friendliness towards the "okupas".
And by it the police operation to clear the park demonstrators' Zuccotti was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves seeing as the occupations had developed in other cities.
A simulacrum of major catastrophe took place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the called disorders training - anti-terrorist measurements that were implying mobilizing quickly a big number of officials of police officer - Manhattan centred on the Lower.
The last training meeting was on Monday night, in the side of Manhattan of the river East.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, that they referred to the mission only like "an exercise".
"To few polis that I know that they were called for this, they did not say to them that it was to enter the park Zuccotti", said the person, who spoke about anonymous form.
"The only persons who knew that they were going to enter the park Zuccotti were in the highest levels of the department."
A reason for the secretismo was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, a few agents wanted to clear the park, but they desisted when hundreds of demonstrators arose before time after having heard about the plans.
The Tuesday operation implied agents of several police units, including special forces of the whole municipal district - tens mobile agents that usually usually flooded the quarters with high delinquency index.
Mister Kelly said that many people, like those who travel every day to the work, they had been going and coming from the park during the day, doing of 1 a.m. a good hour to enter.
"It was adapted to do it when the least number of persons was in the park", he said.
Trucks of the Unit of Emergency services with foci and loudspeakers were congregating in the crossing of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, close to the bridge of Manhattan, before going out.
The lights and the prerecorded messages that were resounding from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
The agents of community matters went to the park with its light blue windscreens, many demonstrators simply gathered its things and went away.
No shop touched up to her 1:45 a.m., said the police, there having time the demonstrators to gather its belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to bring in if it was necessary to do detentions in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman chief of the Department of Police officer, said that it was for its safety.
But many journalists said that one tried to prevent from seeing the police entering action in the park, and that they had been treated sudden by the agents.
Mister Browne said that the television outside broadcast units in Church Street, along the western rim of the park, could capture images.
As the police were moving towards the west across the dense jumble of personal belongings of the demonstrators, including baggage and garbage bags of role and of plastic crammed with clothes, teams of the Department of Cleanliness followed them, gathering what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images in Internet some time after.
A central group of demonstrators took positions close to the kitchen area of the camp, close to the center of the park.
Some of them did a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Concerning approximately 10 persons in the epicenter of the camp candaron between them for the arms.
And two persons were chained to trees, said mister Kelly.
The agents of the emergency service were called to cut the padlocks.
They did not do arrests to themselves in the park even more or less 3:30 a.m., said mister Kelly.
The clearing operation was finished approximately 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mister Browne said that approximately 142 persons were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests went for "alteration of the public order and resistance to the authority", he said.
The agent of higher status in the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the chief of the department, the uniformed top official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the detectives' chief of the department, also was there.
Mister Kelly, while it was present, "it was not directing the operations", said mister Browne.
The second group of agents was waiting along the oriental side of Broadway, between the streets Liberty and Cedar, in case they should enter.
Barricades rose in the street Cortlandt, a block to the north of the park, and in the street Pine, a block on the south.
From these positions, the police were seen extending the enclosed perimeter beyond the park Zuccotti.
In a given moment, a series of agents, many of them with shields, was seen pushing the people towards out.
There were approximately 28 persons in the north perimeter.
Some of the noisiest action of the night took place to the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. a.m., to the south of the street Pine, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a car of police officer, and others were seen removing the air of the wheels of a van of police officer.
In a given moment, a plywood piece went out flying from the multitude.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The trade union of workpeople of support will demand the city for the dismissals
The trade union that represents hundreds of workpeople of school support who lost its work places last month glides to demand the city on Wednesday, alleging that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to its disproportionate impact on the schools that attend to poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the trade union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two assistants of the school, the coordinators of parents and other personnel who were between worse full of the city lost its work on October 7, in a movement that the trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for its denial to allow, last spring, the access on the part of the city a health care fund in charge of groups of work to close its budgetary breach.
The municipal authorities have denied categorically this accusation.
In a hearing in the Town hall last month, the educational adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dismissals were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Advice counter-attacked saying to him that in the budget it was specifying nothing that the members of the personnel of support of the school would be dismissed.
Officials of the municipal district 37 said that they presented the claim in writing, warning to the Department of Education that it would be demanded. A press conference will be celebrated on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and to the Department of Education of the city like accused, and account with eight fired persons as claimants, all of them black or Latin women, as most of the assistants who lost its work places.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore it could not make comments about its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the trade union has centred on the number of dismissals in the schools of poor areas of the city to support a claim for unjust dealing, saying that more assistants lost the poor schools, since they had been subsidized insufficiently of chronic form.
It is indicated that although there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in the schools in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost its work places in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx.
Bearing in mind the loss of five of eight assistants used by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in the poverty, the demand says, "This is not a quarter of wealthy parents who could collect funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.D. The budget of the district 36 diminished in 3,26 per cent this year, and also it lost money when the city changed the form that calculates the additional financing for every registration for student poor in the schools.
The trade union also affirms that the directors of secondary schools can have been cheated by the language in a memorandum that authorizes the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memorandum was using the "excessive" word to describe the action, although "surplus" describes with major frequency the act of moving a teacher of the payroll of a school to a labor exchange, which salaries are paid for the central office.
"Sixty six parents coordinators were dismissed", he says the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus".
Completed mission, the Congress prepared to come to an agreement on Libya
It seems that finally republican and democratic in the Acropolis they are ready to agree about something related with the raising in Libya.
Quite what was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and murdered and the participation of the United States came to its end.
On Tuesday, the Committee of Foreign affairs of the Senate is going to consider a resolution sponsored by the president John Kerry (democrat for Massachusetts), together with senators John McCain (republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for its successful rebellion and to the troops of the USA for its "valor".
"This resolution is to honor the brave ones of Libya, on having begun to reconstruct its country", said Kerry.
"It is an affirmation of two-party support for its democratic aspirations."
The language can seem inoffensive, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy till now.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting between themselves and with the White House on the writing of a series of resolutions to approve or to push back the role of the military men of the USA in the mission of the NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the limited use of military forces of the USA in Libya.
The law project was defeated in the Chamber by a wide two-party margin, and that never gone so far as to be voted in the Senate.
But the same day in which the law project was pushed back in the Chamber, the camera also pushed back a measurement that would have cut the funds away for the American operations in Libya.
That one left the mission of the USA in a species of legislative purgatory - with the Congress the sufficiently annoying thing as to criticize the handling on the part of Obama of the mission, but not so angered as in fact to reap the grass under its feet.
Next, the indecision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli came across of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered on October 20.
The mission of the NATO ended officially on October 31.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee of Foreign affairs "congratulates the people of Libya on its tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to be liberated themselves" and "it praises the men and women of the Armed forces of the United States and its associates of the coalition who took part in military operations to protect the people of Libya for its extraordinary valor and professionalism".
Also "the national interest of the United States declares the resolution in a successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in Libya."
Will gain the new measurement the finished support of the commission of Foreign affairs, or will divide the legislators as it did the project of law of June?
The last version was pushed back by senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main republican of the committee.
The spokesman of Place said Monday that had not seen yet the final version of the new project of law.
To another side of the Acropolis, the Chamber is going to vote for this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the republican conferees and some democrats.
The measurement sponsored by the republican Bob Goodlatte (republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic in fact, that achieves a voting of the whole assembly in the Chamber or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful until now to make its amendments come to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
That of Goodlatte is alone one of 68 constitutional amendments that have got in this Congress, which a wide range of topics includes.
Someone are duplicated - the same law project is proposed both in the Chamber and in the Senate - and others with light changes between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance only in the Chamber, and another fistful that "will control the federal expense."
Some of these projects of law also are identical between themselves, but there give to its sponsors - especially republican beginners who think about how to refine its résumés - the opportunity to boast about that they were the "authors" of the above mentioned measurement.
The Law of Control of Budget, which was approved in August, needed that both the Chamber and the Senate were voting for an amendment of the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of not binding resolution that supports the idea of this amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of orders that the Congressmen can fulfill, while the representative José E. Mountain (democrat for New York), he wants to remove the limit of two orders for the presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democrat for Illinois) he has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to a quality education and sanitary attention, between other topics.
An amendment that prohibits the homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the flags fire.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of the federal laws if they are pushed back by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiasts who have been the members at the time of proposing amendments, are not moving to a rhythm more rapid than in the previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 modifications, and presented 66 in the 110th one.
The rhythm is unacceptable compared to that of the decade of 1990, when the members were presenting regularly more than 150 amendments every two years, according to numbers provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they were not very successful of that time of what they have it now.
The last amendment that added to itself - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Struck but not defeated," Giffords speaks in its first interview in TV from the shooting
Ten months after a gunman was shooting him at close range in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrat by Arizona) appeared in the national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway "The sun will go out tomorrow" and said that he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to the Congress.
In its appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords was fighting to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back of the damages caused by a bullet that fractured the skull and perforated the left side of its brain, and that happened from the front up to the back of its head.
Three months ago, it returned for surprise to the Chamber to express its triumphant vote in the agreement of the debt roof.
In its first television interview from the shooting of January, which killed six and hurt 13, Giffords he smiled, laughed and sang - and described its recovery as "difficultly".
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, Giffords, of 41 years, he answered: "Enough good".
The interview with Giffords and its husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, it was a part of a special program of "20/20" of an hour of duration, which expressed eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A history of courage and hope".
The special program was analyzing the Giffords recovery from the shooting of January 8.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, it is seen in its hospital bed, with the shaved head and a long scar crossing its front.
She can only maintain one or two straight fingers, while its husband the soul.
Months later, Giffords sat in a wheelchair is seen while the therapists teach him how realizing simple actions.
A head movement.
A gathering of the lips.
And then, its first word: "What".
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "toast", a change request in its breakfast menu.
Videos spread by ABC show that the music played a central role in the Giffords recovery: The conferee is seen singing together with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" of Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours ago of therapy every day, he said that he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Its husband said that he was reading to Giffords an article about the newspaper about the murder of March 12 when she detained it to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is stopped in a prison of Missouri and is being medicated by the force while he waits for judgment.
"Mucha gente murió", le dijo Giffords Sawyer.
"I last, last, last."
Kelly said to Sawyer that in a moment of the recovery of its wife, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So, I said to him, "'Gabby, you have not been defeated,'" said Kelly.
"Only you have been struck.
And you are going to go out of this, and are going to recover and are going to turn with more force that never."
The troops make to feel more a pity that I respect
The event was a gala of Wall Street that collected million dollars for the veterans without hearth in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on the powerlessness, the frustration and the loss.
In this moment, several hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aviators and infantes of marina popped in in its positions concerning him.
The multitude of tag stood up and they applauded.
"The men and women were considered to be heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring funds collection.
A military official of high status in the gala, also acquaintance like the president of that time of the Joint staff, admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops of a different way.
"They showed them like a species of orphan child", wrote the official in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
That had them.
But it was not a respect, really. It was a pity.
The distinctly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relation that admirer has empowered of the military men and an often distant American public, sometimes.
It shows itself to the troops with praises for its sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public increasingly acts as if those uniformed were making him sad.
"We are not victims by no means", said the brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon it will set off towards Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way of which some of them show its support is to put ourselves to us in the role of helpless souls."
The topic is a very sensitive topic for the military leaders, who do not want to look like ungrateful persons or in disagreement with the public to whom they serve.
Also they realize that the anger which there faced the troops that returned in the last years of the war of Vietnam was much worse.
As result, most of the conversations about a pity are carried out in silence and privately between the war veterans.
After its two children returned of fighting with the Infantry of Marina, the retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the people apart from the military men would consider to be its service from two perspectives.
Some of them would look at them with a fear feeling because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "angry and violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, which fought in Iraq and returned to a work of high level of the government in Washington.
During its employment search, he said, felt that some interviewers had asked him thinly if it would be capable of lasting under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after its combat tour.
"When you speak about your service, you need to face to the negative impressions", remembered Cancian it being told to its children.
The military worry arises, partly, from the American indifference towards the wars.
The achievements in the field of battle are chosen rarely for the praise on the part of a country that has familiarity small with the military men and sees few direct benefits of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, like nation, already do not value the military heroism of ways that were completely common in the Second World war", said the retired general lieutenant David Barno, who commanded the troops of the USA in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praises of the politicians and of the public center to a great extent on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours that they have supported, the number of friends who have lost or the scope of its injuries.
The army confronts an increasing pressure to finish with the violation
This week, a historical hearing will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army as its supposed passivity before the violation.
If not, hundreds of claimants are organizing themselves for the following one.
Soldier of the first Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she says that it was violated by a partner.
It was an October, 2008, and it was going on returning to its barracks in the Air base Miramar, to the north of San Diego, after the dinner with a friend when it met a companion who was taking a bundle of 12 canisters of beer.
He asked him if he could join her in its room to have a drink.
"A sign of alarm sounded", says Lyman.
Nevertheless, the native of Texas left aside its worry.
I thought, no, it has 19.
"It is of Texas", he says.
"I hope he had listened to my instincts."
To a few minutes of entering the Lyman room, the man him approached behind, throwing it down and violating it, it alleges.
This week, November 18, Lyman and another 27 current and ancient members of the military personnel wait nervously for a judicial decision in a historical judgment that will be celebrated in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand that they have interposed against the exsecretary of Defender Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to judgment.
The demand alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the violation generalized between the military men, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, A.D., the demand was implying initially 17 claimants, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them affirm that they were violated or attacked sexually by its partners, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or giving justice adapted after the supposed aggressions.
Burke says that it goes for the biggest page of the army, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a structure upside-down", he says.
"Who are the persons who are in conditions to eradicate the culture of the countermeasures? The high command."
Burke also says that from February, nearly 400 more survivors have got in touch with her, many of which might be a report of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the claimants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, for this way saying it, it is going to present several cases, of being necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The team of the defense for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal district attorney Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to reject the case.
The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defense - essentially, that the military men cannot be demanded by current or ancient soldiers for the injuries suffered in the armed forces.
For a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damages suffered by the personnel in active service.
"The alleged damages are a part of the military service of the claimants", they say the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to make comments for this article.
The things have changed from the 50s.
While they it is still officially prohibited to serve in combat to the women, this distinction is only a face-value: The modern wars rarely have the lines of the front clear.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women welded are redeeming more and more important roles, especially to come to the local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women welded have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the army also to modernize, says Burke.
She is not alone in its struggle, and another three demands are in march, in addition to his.
In the faculty of Right of yale, the Clinic of Juridical Services for Veterans it is preparing a case against four main military academies for supposedly promoting a misogynous ambience.
On the other hand, the organization without lucre fortitude Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army who centers on the diagnoses of "disorder of the personality" assigned to the victims of violation in order to give to them high of the service - a common event, according to the activists, like Anu Bhagwati of the Network of Women's Action in Service, a group of human rights.
Its group presented a demand in December against the Veterans' Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the form in which he handles the benefits claims for the persons who say to have been attacked sexually in the service.
Nine law projects have appeared separately in the Congress on the part of a two-party miscellany of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3.158 denounced sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual assault and Answer of the Department of Defense.
Nevertheless, the aggressions are significantly infra denounced, and for the proper estimations of the Pentagon, which he codes in approximately 13,5 per cent of 19000 dear incidents that took place this year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution indexes: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases denounced in the army it went to judgment - the half than in the system of civil justice.
The claimants in case of Burke, describe its attacks as only the first one of a series of traumas.
In case of Lyman, it denounced the supposed violation of the military police less than one hour after it happened.
This night, he says, asked him to tell the details of its violation 11 times different to a multitude of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She surrendered to a violation kit, and the blood of its aggressor - of a cut in its arm - was found in its bed.
Six months later, in April, 2009, Lyman was present at a hearing before a judge, during which one asked him about that it should have sexual intercourse with its fiancé the day of the attack.
Six persons declared like personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally absolved.
"I remember the day in which the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought that it me was going to go to the work - I was shouting from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I went out, I remember that I said to my control official, ""This was not its judgment. This was my judgment".
To Lyman it was ordained to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a disorder of the personality, what made her not suitable for the service.
In January, 2010 it was excused of the service under terms less - que-honorables, what prevents him from receiving any benefit.
If the case presented by Lyman and its partners of demand continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, teacher of Right in the faculty of Right George Washington.
Nevertheless, it points out, "In my opinion, they should be capable of going forward".
What intervenes between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I have been a permanent critic of the Doctrine Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and dissuasion that raises the responsibility.
And he adds: "The probabilities are hard against them... but it is important for them to try it."
These things only change when the good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not go for its way, Burke pleaded of the claimants, will put to the tail its other hundreds of claimants for future cases.
"We are going to keep on fighting against the army in this topic until the reform takes place", he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How are the investigators studying you in Facebook
Before turning into the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply different type that was airing its points of view anti-immigration in line.
On Monday, Breivik, who allowed to have realized a slaughter in Norway in July, which stopped 77 dead persons, faced its first public judicial hearing.
While Breivik can have acted as alone, it was far from being alone in the cyberspace: There had happened most of the time that preceded its attack opposite to its computer, chatting with some of the million about nationalists who support to the groups of rights in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the investigators wanted to know more about these persons.
But: how to find them?
Easy - you have only to enter Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to come to them", says Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently on the European digital populism for the British center of studies LET'S GIVE.
The consignment of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the investigators might use simply the publicity tool to determine its demographic characteristics wished with a scientific precision - the way that the sellers have been using for years.
The team of Bartlett found half a million fans of the groups of rights in the whole Europe and then they directed announcements to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or product of diet, the announcements were inviting the users to complete a survey about that he was asking of its educational level, attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future.
On having come across Facebook, Bartlett and its companions were capable of studying more than 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - everything without to go out of the office.
"It is a completely new way of doing an investigation", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not completely surprising: The followers in line of the groups of rights tend to be young people, men and angered by the immigration.
Nevertheless, in a draft species, "those that combine its activism in line with the activism out of line are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than that that they remain behind the screen of the computer".
The DEMOS work is alone an example of how Facebook is turning into a new and important tool in hands of the scientists.
Research centers, medical investigators and political scientists are using the place to study everything, from problems of health to social tendencies as they express in "I like", messages to themselves in the walls and updates of the state.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, "supernova of information" of Facebook a heyday of the investigation is generating it, it impelling the number of academic works with the name of the place in the title up to almost 800 % in the last five years.
For some investigators, the Facebook beauty is that he allows you to study the persons whom you could not approach with a folder in the street.
"Earlier, when you were trying to poll persons of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go across the party, and they would never allow you the access", says Bartlett.
"Facebook elimina todo eso - vas un ellos directamente."
Others say that the place might provide a way of identifying and of tackling the problems of social health.
A recent study realized by doctor Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its companions, thought that the university students who spoke about its drunkenness exploits in Facebook had a significantly major risk of having problems with the drink that the students who remained in silence on the topic.
Dark-haired person suggests that the partners of the students, such as the residential advisers, might control the place and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of the state with its drunkenness.
"You cannot treat a problem if you cannot diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, the coauthor of Dark-haired person and the director of the health Center, Behavior and Child development in the Institute of Infantile Investigation of Seattle, said the Washington Post.
"We have found a way of identifying children in risk who otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook also is "puncturing" constantly its own population to obtain information.
The Team of Information of the place has prepared statistics on the state of the relation and the Day of San Valentín, the expectation of electoral participation to half of the legislative period of 2010, and an index of Felicidad Nacional (principally using the information to which it is possible to gain access - defenders of the digital freedom long ago who support that the place should put at the disposal of others its large number of information for the investigation).
Nevertheless, the Facebook users know that the place is watching them, they liked or not - the sacrifice for being able to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometers of distance is to allow the place to mine your personal information.
But: what raisin when the Facebook users spend to be part of a survey that they do not even know?
While the investigators have quite definite guidelines on how gathering its information out of line, in line it is a bar free for all.
"I do not believe that many of the users have thought at least about the fact that an investigator might be examining its profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a study of 2006 that it carried out with the public walls of students' Facebook.
"In what was concerning them, it was only between they and its friends."
Then is the question of the methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee of which a this investigation topic being completely honest.
In Facebook, it is impossible to know that it departs from the information of the profile of a user and from the messages of the wall they are true.
"Lo que juega a los dados en Facebook y lo que haces fuera Dos de hijo de Facebook cosas completamente diferentes", juega a los dados Selwyn.
That's why, in spite of its years like investigator of the technology, Selwyn believes that a paperclip and a pen keep on being the best hardware of investigation that nobody could use.
"There is no substitute to enter the real world and to speak with the real people", he says.
"The social research supposes that it is on the social thing - and a heap of the social thing still happens out of line."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik does its first public appearance in the court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of two attacks that killed 77 persons in Norway this summer, has described himself as a combatant of the "resistance" during its first public appearance in the court of Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian movement of resistance and in the Gentlemen Templarios de Noruega", he said before a full room with 500 persons.
"I am opposed to the court, since it received the order of the organizations that support the ideology of the hate and because it supports the multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because "he did not want to give to Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform so that it expresses its points of view".
For the same reason one refused to allow to Breivik, that it brought a speech written with advance, to speak to the relatives of its victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to maintain to low Breivik care for 12 more weeks, prohibited him the access to the mass media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control on all the visits and the mail for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims were present at the hearing.
Some of them came with the hope to look at Breivik at the eyes, others to confirm that he is imprisoned under key.
They all helped with the target to advance towards the conclusion.
"I thought that it seemed cold and inhuman", said an Utoya survivor to the broadcasting station ​​ Norwegian NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step pass after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik stayed calmed and professional along the hearing and looked at the journalists and at the survivors at the eyes when it entered and went out of the building.
In spite of the strange notion of Breivik of being a part of a movement of major "resistance", the judge determined that he is not a mental patient, and said that there are no proofs that it was acting with accomplices.
It is possible that it consoles some that the attacks of July 22 seem to be a work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not smooth automatically the pain and the confusion that the whole nation still feels.
"I would like that it was looking like a monster, but it it does not seem", said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it it seemed."
7 lessons of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, they show themselves in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some of them who compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of the technology like the Big Modern Inventor.
But what the Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview to Jobs recently re-discovered to the one that has dusted like advance of a series of special projections on the biggest markets this week, it is how much understood this creative mind about the commercial processes and flows of work of the products.
He was undoubtedly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but also it was a meticulous organizer and a yonki of the flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives were suffering "an illness that he consists of thinking that a big idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] there is an enormous work quantity between a big idea and a big product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the series of television The Triumph of the Nerds (The victory of the idiots) on the dawns of the personal computer, and it sat down during more than one hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
In this moment 10 years had happened scantly since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and it was already employed intensely at its new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of Internet.
While a small part of the interview of Cringely was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during its transport.
It was only after the Jobs death that a finished copy was discovered in VHS in the garage of the director.
This material of file, lightly re-edited, is the base of Steve Jobs: The lost interview, of 68 minutes, that this Wednesday and Thursday comes to the movies Landmark.
For someone known for hating the interviews in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly ready to exhibit its technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points along the interview, there are big silences between the questions and the answers - from 10 until 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is hefting clearly its thoughts, looking for precision.
Also there are moments in which the Jobs perfectionism goes out to the surface, where it seems impatient due to the Cringely questions, pushing him to go more rapid towards the topics or arguments of major importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what sees that other companies are right and evil, and it offers its own vision of the future of the computer science.
A thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the career of Jobs, but there is slightly raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer at the edge of the nobility.
He has a vision of as they can and must be the things.
Not, much after explain everything in detail here, it was and it did it.
A rapid summary of seven notable sequences of The lost interview:
On how did a business learn to go:
"Throughout the years in the business, I was always asking:" "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give to you of invariable form are: "Oh, that is alone the way as it is done".
Nobody knows why it does what it does, in the business nobody thinks about the things very deeply.
This is what I found.
Jobs takes to the detail its efforts to simplify the Apple accounting.
Disconcerted by the form in the costs were registering - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done roughly of good cooper, and that then was fitting with a "variable" - there developed an automated factory that he was assuring that they might determine the commercial costs to the detail.
On the prank to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he constructed himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that the telephone company was allowing to the people hackear efficiently and to do long-distance calls free.
He has written himself extensively about the device, but the Jobs euphoria, here on having described the Blue Box as an act of empoderamiento, is contagious.
It describes how it and Wozniak proved the box by means of the use of a public phone, doing a call, and then getting connected from an AT network and T to other one, while it was creating a ringlet with the biggest possible satellites quantity.
"We were wrapping the things about the world a half a dozen of times and you were shouting across the public phone and it was returning a minute later to the public phone of the door of nearby", says Jobs with a snigger.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could construct something ourselves that it might control thousands of million dollars in infrastructure in the whole world."
We two, we did not know very much, but we could construct a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple had ever existed without her.
Jobs keeps on describing a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost leave, calling the Vatican across the Blue Box in half of the night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while it was doing its best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the catholic hierarchy were summoned in half of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two exploded in guffaws just before the very same Pope was woken up to go to answer the phone.
On falling in love with the technology (and the sale by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, in the hunting for spare parts to construct a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and did a call to him.
Shortly after its phone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs obtained an employment of part-time summer in Hewlett-Packard.
"This was a notable influence on me, it was the only company that it had seen at this age and was forming my vision of what was a company and well that they were treating its personnel."
Jobs turned later into one of the personnel of HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where it saw "the first never done table computer".
It was so big as a suitcase, it had a small screen of cathode pipe, and I fell in love with him.
It would obtain a trip up to HP as adolescent and would lose the time with this machine and would write programs for her.
On improvising the innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in its career, since he devoted himself to sell a fistful of basic badges, a client asked him if it could mount the whole team.
Working with only 30 credit days, it had to find out the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while it was in Apple, he remembers the struggles which it faced in the development of a mouse of computer:
"I remember to have dramatic arguments... they were shouting to me that they would be needed five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I got fed up and went away out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could construct for 15 dollars and that was completely trustworthy.
On the big companies losing force:
Long before he was leading the Apple renaissance, Jobs proféticamente foresaw the form in which many leaders of the industry would stumble in its vision, and would lose the control of its market share.
"Say that you are employed at IBM or Xerox, therefore you do copiers and better printers: and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, for what the company is not more successful.
The selling departments and marketing increase the success, therefore there are this class of persons those that there end up directing the companies and the persons in charge of the products they are expelled from the forum for the decision making.
The genius of the products who led to this monopoly position rots through the fault of persons who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
This is what it spent in Xerox...
Xerox might have taken possession of the whole computer industry.
Its size might have been ten times, it might have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of the victory.
On the innovation as artistic expression:
"There is an enormous work quantity between a big idea and a big product... as the big idea evolves, changes and grows."
It is learned very much about the details of the same one.
There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that you cannot do that they do the electrons, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to maintain 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - them to fit all simultaneously...
In the end everything comes down to the taste - stoops to trying to exhibit you perhaps that a team of human beings has done, and then to try to adapt these things to which you are doing.
Picasso was saying that the good artists copy, the big artists steal.
We have never had shame about stealing big ideas.
What partly it made big to the Macintosh was that the persons who were employed at him were musical, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who by chance were the best computer scientists of the world.
If it was not for the computer science, it might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the rivals of the law of health care while the court accepts the case
The day that the Supreme Court met in private to examine the question politically controversial if Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas would accept the challenge to the law of health care of the president Obama, two of its magistrates, they were entertained in a dinner sponsored by the lawyers' signature that will exhibit the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study meticulously the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a demand presented by 26 states defying the entire reform of the health care approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a war-cry for the conservative activists in the whole country.
The magistrates agreed to admit to step the demand and, in fact, one waits for a historical unproved statement of 5 hours and a half for March, and the result probably will muddy moreover the presidential career of 2012, which will be in full climax at the moment when the decision of the court is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will allege that the law must be rejected will be probably Paul Clement, who served like general district attorney of the USA during the government of George W. Bush.
The lawyers' signature of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozens of companies that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that takes many years dedicated to the defender of the conservative juridical beginning.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents to one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., that has an enormous financial interest in the result of the litigation.
The dinner was celebrated in a hotel of Washington, some hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
Between the assistants there was, between others, Mitch McConnell, the most important republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the law of health care.
The special guests in the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is not new at all: Two judges have been present at events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it is not anything that between in conflict with the ethical norms.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the low federal magistrates.
If they it were not, one might be said that they would fall down under the Code Canon 4C, that says: "A judge can be present at events to collect funds of organizations related to the law and others, although the judge cannot be an orator, a guest of honor, or appear in the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawyers' buffets in the case, as well as to a company with an enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm the ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of the ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several magistrates that the court respects for the same rules that are applied to all the federal judges", said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were entertained in a collection of funds of gala with lawyers who have hanging cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in the funds collection for this event undermines any impartiality demand, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have showed little interest in the criticism that say that they mix too easily the activity of the court with the agenda impelled by groups like the Federalist Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is an out-standing conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives argue that the magistrada is Helen Kagan, which has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked like general lawyer of the administration Obama when the first legal challenges appeared to the law in the court of the first instance.
Its critics have pressed so that Kagan abstains from seeing the case, saying that it was too much involved in defending the law as now to be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication of which it is going to do it.
Boeing receives a record order for 18 billion dollars
The airline Emirates asks 20 for 50 planes of double corridor Boeing 777, with option more.
Boeing also sells six planes Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, an operation valued for more than billion dollars.
Rarely it is a news when a company obtains an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of planes Boeing Co. and the price of sale for 50 planes it amounts to a record for 18 billion dollars.
It is so big as the place from which Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold-mine in growth of future orders of planes.
In a study announced Monday, the company of Chicago thinks that during the next 20 years the airlines in Middle East will need 2.520 planes for value 450 billion dollars.
Boeing announced during the weekend its biggest order of the history for commercial planes for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 of double corridor.
The successful order came from the airline Emirates in Dubái.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, what would raise the price of entire sale to 26 billion dollars, announced Boeing in the Aeronautical Lounge of Dubái 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked for six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which it presumes of a fuel saving and a few services for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six of them is more than billion dollars.
"This has clearly an enormous positive effect for Boeing", said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these clients in particular is very strong."
Many airlines of Middle East are a property of its producing nations of oil.
Therefore, not only they have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in the prices of the fuel - in general harmful to the air lines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is gaining money with the increase of the oil price.
That is important because they have less probabilities that other airlines of canceling or delaying the flight orders when the prices of the fuel increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection", he said.
The order of the Emirates hardens the Boeing leadership on the market of planes of wide fuselage and helps to maintain to streak the attempt of its rival Airbus SAS of invading its domain with the passengers' plane A350.
The Boeing victory in the fair of the air takes place four months after Airbus was saying that it was going to delay the début of the biggest A350, that competes straight with 777-300ER.
It delayed the début to add more impulse after the clients were demanding an increase of the useful load and of the status.
The actions of Boeing Co raised a 1,5 % up to 67,94 dollars.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the voting of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderón affirms that the drug traffickers helped its opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
The sister of the president Felipe Calderón seems to have lost its candidacy to governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she affirmed Monday that the drug traffickers helped to incline the career in favor of one of its opponents.
The preliminary results gave the front part in the career for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the whole electoral process and, especially yesterday, it is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country", said Luisa Maria Calderón in a radio interview one day after the Sunday voting.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workpeople... They took possession of the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico during seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
Nevertheless, it is the staging of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI has the hope to gain the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overcome nearly margin Caldron, who had led the surveys before the elections.
Caldron, a candidate of the conservative Partido de Acción Nacional of its brother, or BREAD, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of lefts for the Party Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which at present occupies the governor's charge, stayed in the third place, a big defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exmayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied ties with the drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for the long time for cárteles of the drug specialized in marijuana, heroine and metanfetaminas.
It is the native state of the president Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to take the military offensive directed against the traffickers in December, 2006.
Nevertheless the violence has persisted.
A mayor of the BREAD was murdered one week before the elections while it was doing campaign for Luisa Maria Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidacies for fear.
Although for the PRI, for unpleasant that the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help to impel the party.
The man who is supposed will represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, he congratulated Vallejo and said: "I believe that this victory should be very encouraging, facing the next year".
The BAsD urges Asia to help to rescue to the euroarea
The Asian Bank of Development (BAsD) has called India and China so that they prepare themselves to help to rescue to the euroarea of its crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term recession that there would prevent the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asian Bank of Development with head office in Manila, said that two big economies of more rapid growth of the world had to "do all the possible" already to accelerate the recovery of the economic block out across the International Monetary Fund or straight across bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe of an "impartial" way and said that the financial assistance of Asia together with the leadership and European resources they would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We are all together in this."
"So anyone that could help to Europe to go out of the crisis is useful", there said Financial Times to in an interview in the frame of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a point, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, to be for all the means."
The European monetary union has turned out to be seriously undermined by a crisis of sovereign debt in the last months.
In the last days, the costs of indebtedness of Italy have gone off dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears of that it could push to the world economy to the recession and has generated called so that the main emergent economies join to help to the euroarea to find a solution.
Mister Nag predicted that any support of Asia would be canalized across the IMF, but he said that the bilateral assistance - like the buy of the bonds of the fund of rescue of the EU, the European Fund of financial stability - was offering a major bargaining power for the Asian associates of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian minister of Commerce, said that "the India is going to do all the possible" to help to the euroarea since its own economy now was suffering the fall of the exports and the depletion of the earnings of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants that the euroarea keeps on being unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges and have to maintain a high growth level."
"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because: where do we find employment for tens million our young men and women."
Others argue that the economies in development as India have no responsibility in helping the rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, teacher of the University of Brown in the USA, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the help to Europe for the billions two hundred thousand persons of the India, of which even 800 millions live with nearly 2 dollars a day or less.
"In some moment they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and take a vacation to the beaches and that will not like", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why the reservations of the India had to be used to maintain the numerous ones and quite stipendiary workpeople of the Greek public sector, in companies jobs badly administrated, and generating of losses like the railroads.
Mister Nag said that the crisis of the euroarea threatens with "important effects in chain" for the whole Asia.
The prognosis of the Asian Bank of Development of 7,5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 faces now the "risks to the fall" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emergent markets needed to do "plans of risk" to be protected from a crisis and significant exits of capital of its economies.
Serious notices of the Pentagon about the possible clippings in defense
The secretary of Defense, León Panetta, warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic clippings of budget that approach might undermine the national security and provoke a financial reaction in chain from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civil chains of assembly.
The Pentagon is already digesting 450 billion dollars of reductions throughout next decade, but now he is afraid of an additional reduction of 600 billions or more in clippings that it can be imminent if the Congress does not manage to come to an agreement on the expense.
"The impact of these clippings would be devastating for the department", said Panetta in a letter to senators John McCain, republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, republican for South Carolina.
He said that the defeat of the Congress to come to an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the called "sequestration", they would give place to 23 per cent of global reductions and a high place to many new projects.
"Such a big clipping, applied this way indiscriminate, would do that most of our naval projects and of construction could not be executed - it is not possible to buy the fourth three parts of a ship or a building - and to damage seriously other modernization efforts", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"Also we would turn out to be forced to separate many of our civil officials of involuntary form and, because the reduction would be imposed by so much rapidity, it is almost sure that we would have to license civil in order to fulfill the target."
"These changes would break the faith with those that they maintain our army and would damage seriously the good disposition."
The clippings with the time would reach to the combat troops, said Panetta.
"Although the financing for war times in the accounts of Operations of risk overseas does not turn out to be straight affected by the sequestration, the efforts of the war would turn out to be affected negatively for the serious disorders in the base budgets", warned Panetta.
"The personnel hiring would diminish, what it would take to debts in the contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"The personnel in payroll would diminish, giving place to debts in the payments to the providers in war time, and the juridical and political support would be discontinuous."
Two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic clippings in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a sequestration in the Department of Defense would provoke a rapid slope of the United States as main military potency of the world."
"We are firmly against this draconian action", said the senators in a joint bulletin on Monday evening when they published the Panetta letter.
"East is not a result with which it is possible to live, and certainly it is not one that we should set ourselves on ourselves."
"The sequestration is a threat for the interests of the national security of the United States, and it is not necessary to be allowed that it happens."
If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify the calls to exempt to the Pentagon of the clippings it is still to see.
Panetta has been more and more frank on the possible clippings, although it came to a work in the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that it was facing difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, the secretary of Defense painted a shaded panorama of what might be ahead - an army with a conch, but not a nucleus.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"Es una brigada pecan balas."
"It is an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It is a role tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers qualified to fulfill the mission", said Panetta in its opening words in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that there suffers the moral fall, the deficient preparation and is not capable of keeping up to date with the opposing potentials."
"In effect, he invites to the aggression..."
In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciates new details of how the reductions "generate important operative risks: he stays on in the time of answer to the crises, conflicts and disasters; it limits severely our aptitude to be opened and compromised previously in the whole world; and he supposes an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest projects of defense it might confront the axe, included those that are already trying on and some only in the first stages of the planning.
The above mentioned list includes the plane of combat F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new due bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new ship of coastal combat and the new combat vehicle in ground that the Army and the Marina need to replace, the humvee.
To stop the development and the additional tests of the F35 might generate approximately 80 billion dollars in savings throughout 10 years, but its followers say that it is the following vital step to improve and to confront the potential threats of China and other rivals.
Like detecting a lie
A glance to the most recent holders indicates how serious and omnipresent are the trick and the lie in the daily life.
The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is occupied exchanging sexual harassment accusations with several women; every part accuses of lying to other one.
The managers of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for supposedly concealing inform that they were saying that a trainer of retired soccer was attacking sexually children.
Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" by an open microphone affirming the president of the USA, Barack Obama, that the Israeli prime minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar.
To lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The conferee for New York and exhibitionist in Internet, Anthony Weiner, disgraced with its denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
Ex-presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in the financing of the campaign related to the concealment of an extramarital relation.
And, again, nobody who was living through it will ever forget the circus mediático untied by the president Bill Clinton on having lied during its second order about its sexual intercourse with Mónica Lewinsky.
The legends are very widespread on the pitfalls in the examinations of the school and the university.
Cases have happened in that the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students in order to be better seen in its yield evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message of which to lie and to cheat are acceptable.
How many trick are we?
In an any day, the studies show that from 10 to 200 times can lie to you in any place.
These sure, many of these lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that the strangers were lying three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
To detect lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charade, where the target is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of the trick is a serious branch of the knowledge based on scientific information obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that realized research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
The liars yes look at the eyes.
Not always they stutter, babble, redden or worry.
It is not possible to conclude either that the liars are difficult to detect or to unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth learning about the structure of the declaration, the microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I spent several years exploring the scientific discoveries on the trick in the vast and always emergent body of the knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of the trick is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps to sail along our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include the hiring, interviews, or the negotiations management.
The good liars have the skill of reading well to the others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and feeling of intuitive form how the others perceive them.
We know for the investigations that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that the men say more "lies faced towards themselves", while the women say more lies "faced towards the others" - normally to protect the feelings of someone - that the married persons lie less often to its couples that the persons who are not married (but the lies that they usually say tend to be "enormous").
Also we know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, the others will feel less guilty on having lied to him.
How to know if someone is lying?
First, I observed the habitual conduct of the subject.
This calls itself "to create a base line".
It helps to provide reference points to measure later the changes.
Observe the position of the subject, laugh and vocal characteristic.
It is better that he knows if someone normally bangs with the foot all the time not to do unjust accusations when it sees the feet rattling in half of the meeting.
Next, look for deceitful, verbal and not verbal groups of behavior.
Consider to these groups of behavior like signs of alarm, not like test of trick.
The persons who cheat can freeze the top part of the body on having tried to remember its history, can aim at its feet towards the door, incline towards an exit, change its position of a significant way or exhibit a "relief postinterviews" - this exaggerated sigh of mitigation and change of position once all the difficult questions have ended.
Often the interrogators make to see falsely that the interview has finished only to look for this mitigation he postinterviews.
Also ready attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson put the paw up to the fund and used last time while he was affirming that its murdered wife was alive, throwing her search at national level.
The persons who cheat also can use a language distanciador: "I had no sexual intercourse with this woman... miss Lewinsky" or to repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a heap of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Good... to tell truth... up to what I... to me to understand."
This does that the answer is a perception instead of a fact and it is often a sign of alert.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to discover the trick it is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid to be killed by the artists of the swindle in its professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the oil pipeline turned away after the threat of the delay of the USA in its approval
Days after Obama's administration was threatening to delay the approval of an oil pipeline planned from Canada up to the Gulf of Mexico - infuriating to the trade unions, while it was pacifying the ecologists - the company that thinks about how to construct the oil pipeline says that it is ready to forward the project it to direct again.
TransCanada said Monday night that will move the oil pipeline planned out of the area unnaturally sensitive of Sandhills in Nebraska, and he trusts that the project will gain the approval.
The company announced the decision in the press conference in the Acropolis of Nebraska.
The manager of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence in that with the time the oil pipeline is approved, although it is true than with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week on the part of the Department of the State from that would delay the decision for a federal permission for the project until there are studied new potential routes that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the aquifer Ogallala, a vast groundwater supply.
"This is a real progress route", said the representative Lee Terry, republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review arranged by the Department of the State is possible that it separates any decision until 2013, after the elections of next year, although the officials denied that the politics was wrapped in the decision.
Obama, in a written declaration last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of the State, and expressed all its support to them.
The oil pipeline, of 1.700 kilometers it would spread from Canada up to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700.000 barrels for day of Alberta's province to the refineries in Texas.
For it, it would be necessary that it was crossing six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the groups of work, which they have bet for the estimation of 20.000 jobs linked to the oil pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska put up against the plan are hefting the legislation to force an alienation of the region of Sandhills and of the aquifer Ogallala, the biggest source of drinking water and of irrigation.
The study of current environmental impact of the Department of the State thought that the alone project was raising limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the power industry said that the general inspector of the department has arranged a test independent from the process of review, centring on two questions.
One is if the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was an adviser of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents an interests conflict for the program.
Other one is if a signature that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate election because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle demanded for supposedly provoking that a child will be sick of fear
A family of New York affirms that the prima donna of the music I dial, Patti LaBelle, he behaved like a madwoman in the foyer of its building of Manhattan, pulling down its small daughter up to the point of which he was sick of fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" scared Genevieve Monk, of 18 months of age, so much that suffered "changes of personality, disorders of the sleep" and "its fear of the strangers increased", says its family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year when the intriguer Kevin Monk, its wife, Roseanna, teacher of garden of infancy, and Genevieve were preparing themselves to go to a familiar trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the foyer of the building of Riverside Boulevard, with its baggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said that it stopped close to the door and put its daughter in the soil for a moment.
"Someone approached behind and said to me:" Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said to him "yes' and went to take it", he said.
LaBelle reminded angered the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "it should not have left its daughter close to the door", said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "I do not have any interest in what you say or think".
It became mad and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
It had a water bottle and it began throwing the water of the bottle on me."
He said that Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Sight what you have done to my daughter", said the mother of the girl.
LaBelle rushed forward towards the mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and had to be contained by its environment and retreat to a motorcar that was waiting for it, said Roseanna Monk.
The kidling was weeping so loudly that he was sick, he added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing of LaBelle, but it did not obtain answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on the events.
The demand looks for not stated damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that it took the case of free form and that the family plans to donate all the money that obtains an association of support to the children with cancer.
"The intention is to do Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct", said Davis.
"This type of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when it speaks to a teacher of garden of infancy that takes in arms a child of 18 months of age."
Climatic adversity braked the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa the unemployment and the informality has increased, it lowered the foreign investment and it contracted the economy
2011 is one year that will be remembered in the Sinaloa economic history, it is a question of the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, autonamed of the change, which generated big expectations with regard to the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, growth is not observed, on the other hand yes a deterioration registers in the main indicators of economic development.
The low February temperatures, in addition to causing millionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of the economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first semester of the year, justified principally by the 31.16 per cent historical fall in the agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
In accordance with the affectations report as the frosts, expressed by the Mexican Advice for the Rural development Sustentable, damages were had in 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 per cent they incurred entire loss and the remainder 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main damaged cultivation was those of vegetables, corn and chick-pea.
The fall in the economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase of the unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the valuation of state unemployment during the first three trimesters of the year observed an intensive growth, since while from January until March 55 thousand 053 sinaloenses were vacated, with a valuation of 4.53 per cent of the Population Económicamente Activa, for the second trimester the valuation happened to be a 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average kept on increasing up to 6.19 per cent, a valuation that in number of persons throws more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed men, an increase with regard to the first semester of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, the director of the faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of the unemployment can be explained by implication, according to the actions that from the public politics have been realized.
"What is seen is a growth of the unemployment that has to do with several factors, between them the loss of liquidity on the market for effects of a restriction of resources for the legislation that was approved in the congress to fight the money wash, already for the people who seizes dollars of an illicit way it is not easy to him that it them works, invests them and should use them in anything", it expressed.
Arrested migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in the unemployment a demographic factor exists also.
"The number of persons that goes away of the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, firstly for the difficulties of entering, and second because entering already they have also many difficulties of finding work, these people are remaining and are demanding work sources here in the state, what does that the unemployment rises", it showed.
Informality
The labor market analysis sinaloense worsens on having considered the high level of informality that prevails between the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the working population at the state are employed without being quote like worker before any social security institution.
In addition to the unemployment and informality, other of the labor backlogs of the state there are the low wages, the entity has the lowest remunerations of the Country, in accordance with the records of the Mexican Institute of the Welfare and the Secretariat of the Work and Social Forecast.
The average monthly revenue of the workpeople sinaloenses was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much underneath of the national average located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the fall of the economic activity and the increase in the unemployment, during 2011 there registers the biggest decrease of the Direct Foreign investment of last 10 years, according to the Treasury Department from January until June of the state IED it added 630 thousand 697 dollars, what represents a 87.74 per cent fall with regard to 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For his part, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the state Government takes into account an entire investment of 17 thousand 280 millions in weight in the year, happened principally of companies of the service industries.
The debt
Before the stage of economic contraction, the Government of the state requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billions in weight, themselves that they would be destined the investment in projects of infrastructure in 18 municipalities, for the purpose of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a total of 2 thousand 600 millions in weight, and until November they have not observed the benefits of the indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the managerial sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés gives sample of an absence of capacity of management of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Industry of the Transformation, expressed that during 2011 one lacked the harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including to the proper Government of the state.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work intensely to recover the area that we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, it was lacking to align the effort of all and especially the already synchronized good march of this new team of Government, we hope that next year should be much better", it expressed.
Economic slowness
Loredo López showed that events as the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is a product of several events, between them the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that the sufficiently rapid thing does not turn round to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable flow level in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing much underneath of the expectations that we had", it mentioned.
To re-define vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Management Confederacy of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it showed that it is needed to prosecute the state towards productive activities of major dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that one has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a program of long term in which there is re-defined the vocation and the economic course of the state, because it is important that one detonates the whole potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has", he said.
I work for doing
The president of the Coparmex emphasized the importance of establishing a vision of future that channels better the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been straining for giving good results in different matters, on the subject of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program develops", it showed.
It pointed out that the current administration has showed advances in its way of leading the public politics.
"There are elements that they allow to say that the Government is more enclosing, I what I can say is that there is made work and I believe that the Government is conscious of that there is work for doing", it expressed.
They condemn it for 8 kg of marijuana
To five years of prison and 100 days of fine a Navolato neighbor was sentenced by the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.

It owes contributions for works
The works of social character contemplated in programs as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants they are in risk of not being concluded or of having serious debts due to the absence of economic resources, pointed out Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
Municipal development manager Social indicated that although till now the work programs have advanced, yes they are in risk on not having fulfilled the Government of the State with the contributions that there correspond to him which add a resource superior to 11 millions in weight in three programs.
It pointed out that in whole the investment in these three programs is almost 50 millions in weight, of which it corresponds to the State 25 per cent and that till now only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, for what the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes current.
"There are almost 12 millions what it has them to contribute and although the year is still to end they have given us not even a fifth one, when from July they should have given us a part", it expressed, "we not to be late have initiated the works and they advance much, but we need the money".
It mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not expire with the contributions that were corresponding to them, therefore to the beginning of the administration the Municipality it had to request a credit to cover more than 7 millions that the state administration did not contribute in that occasion.
"It happened already to us in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic aptitude to take part and the programs kept on walking, and this year we to be able to gain access to these programs had to obtain the resources to cover what made the State hanging", it detailed.
Although there exists the commitment of the state authorities to expire with the delivery of these resources, he mentioned that the request has been done to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, of hurrying the negotiations so that the percentages that correspond to them come as soon as possible.
"There are almost 12 millions what it has them to contribute and although the year is still to end they have given us not even a fifth one".
Court validates "analogical blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogical signs for digitalises is one of the most important changes that has suffered the world in the last years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that interposed the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that moves forward the called "analogical blackout" from 2021 to 2015, after eight votes necessary did not meet to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that the president Felipe Calderón did not excel himself in its attributions on having expressed the decree that details the actions to continue to specify the transition to the terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, it was rejected for not reaching most qualified as eight votes so that the Court was declaring itself on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this one remains current.
The project of judgment, prepared by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the matters of radio and television is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the beginning of hierarchic subordination and of reservation of law.
In favor of the project there voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and own Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives promoted two constitutional controversies to oppose the decree, and on having admitted the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions in him arranged for the digital transition.
The ministers' plenary meeting resolved to reject also the demand interposed by the House of Representatives, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its intervention, the minister president said not to coincide with the arguments of the project, to the effect that the Federal executive one could not structure across general norms the measurements so that the public administration is prepared.
"I do not think either that if it should do it there would fall ill the autonomy of the regulatory organ", and he remembered that the planeación of public politics in strategic areas as the sector of telecommunications they correspond to the Federal executive one, who has for constitutional order, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analogical signs for digitalises is one of the most important changes that has suffered the world in the last years, and it is translated in a better use of the bogey radioeléctrico, a better quality of the sign and more channels.
To postpone the change, it supported, would be to postpone the benefits of the digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "since it includes economic, social, political questions and of national security".
These questions, he emphasized, "they demand the operation of the whole established system, in accordance with the beginning of economic rectory of the State, it includes a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the state Executive".
He remembered that a big number of countries in the whole world has already concluded the digital transition, and has done it across the Executive, despite being provided with highly specializing technical organs.
It is not possible to conclude that the Executive, on having expressed the opposed decree, which invades in some form the sphere of competitions of the Congress, since there is provided in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws expressed by the Legislative one, assured.
They analyze possibility of a count "I vote for vote" in Michoacán
In accordance with the information thrown by the PREP the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is of scarcely 27 per cent, and there are still not taken into account the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 thousand 74 entire minutes.
The possibility of the count "voted for vote" it is a reality as for electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where in accordance with the information thrown by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is of scarcely 27 per cent, and there are still not taken into account the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 thousand 74 entire minutes.
On this matter, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, remembered that a few days ago, only last November 9, the electoral organ approved a series of lineaments in order to harmonize the local norms with the federal reform in electoral matter.
As it will be remembered, Michoacán approved neither its Political Constitution nor its Electoral Code of the State or its Law of Electoral Justice, every time the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before concluding the legal term so that they could come into force in the present electoral process and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the period foreseen in the Law of the Official Newspaper of the State, with the argument that it had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislature and qualified like "invalidly and illegally" vote of chief state to the constitutional reforms, every time it has no right of "sanctioning them or to veto them".
Interviewee concerning the possibility of the "vote for vote", Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal exhibited that thanks to the approval of the corresponding lineaments on the part of the General Council of the IEM there will be possible the achievement of partial and entire inventories of the voting on the part of the local electoral organ.
Thus, the partial votes inventory, of one or more electoral bundles, will be able to happen in the assumptions of which: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there does not exist the record of scrutiny and calculation in the records of the pigeonhole or do not act in power of the president of the same one; or, when there exist errors or clear alterations of the minutes.
Also, the entire inventory of the voting received in all the pigeonholes of the election will be able to be realized when there exists indication of which the difference between the winning supposed candidate of the election of which it is a question and the one that has obtained the second place in the voting, it is equal or less to a percentage point; any time to the beginning of the meeting there exists the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that postulated the second one of the special candidates.
The entire inventory of the voting also will be able to realize if, on having finished the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the candidate supposedly winning and located secondly it is equal or less to a percentage point, any time there exists the express request of the representative of the political party which candidate stayed secondly, he married in which there will be excluded the electoral bundles that have been an object of partial inventory.
It is necessary to mention that in the above mentioned situation there is the election of Morelia, where in accordance with the PREP the difference between the first one and the second place is of scarcely 0.16 per cent, although without taking into account the votes of 129 of 923 entire minutes.
Its last wish

The new Italian government will form on Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that it has placed to this country at the edge of the economic disaster
The designated Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has put in danger the whole euroarea.
A bulletin of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that a Government can form.
One hopes that it should present an office composed mostly by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the charge.
Monti said that it will present to the president the result of its conversations with the political parties in its attempt for forming a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the aptitude of our country to overcome this difficult phase", said the European ex-commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not say of explicit form that it will be able to form a government but the tone of its comments they indicated that the obstacles have excelled themselves.
The "frame is delineated however", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less of the normal thing, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has impelled the costs of its debt at untenable levels.
The new administration directed by the European ex-commissioner Monti must approve a hard bundle of austerity demanded by the European leaders to recover the struck confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti so that fast, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian bonds BTP to 10 years over 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland turned out to be forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the management Italian Confindustria, said to the press after meeting Monti: "We said that we would support very much this government".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy goes out of this emergency situation.
The possibilities of success of Monti turned out to be impelled of considerable form by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the teacher Monti are destined to have a good result", he said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the party of centroderecha.
The support of the PDL, the biggest party of Italy, is significant because till now many of its members had been opposed to the majority Government technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably there will be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts might provoke a new and devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure on having warned that a Monti defeat would be a disaster.
Monti initiated on Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and managerial groups, as well as with youth organizations and of women.
It will finish its meetings round on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Neapolitan, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in answer to the crisis.
After a brief breather at the end of last week, when it remained clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have returned now at critical levels between the suspense if the new prime minister will be successful.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt for 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euroarea.
Monti has said that its government should last up to the next elections, foreseen for 2013, despite the widespread predictions on which the politicians only he will have time to apply the reforms before moving forward the elections.
Monti has said that he would like including politicians in its office, but the big parties insist that it must be formed only by technical staff, an indication of its objections before a process forced by the financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that the mutual desconfianzas and the disagreements entity the parties are complicating the attempt of including political figures.
The rubbing of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Rican ones
Of 22 called soccer players of Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
From the alone side of Costa Rica one of 22 summoned ones came to 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if the 22 summoned ones by both countries are compared for the today friendly one, at 3:05 p. m., in the National Stadium of San Jose.
While the world champions and of Europe, number one of the monthly ranquin of the FIFA, they take into account a wide games record class interselections A, the alone Tricolor possesses the defender Michael Umaña like the only one that has 50 international parties.
The above mentioned number reached it the previous Friday in the party against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish soccer players who play in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the League Premier of England, maintain a year an intense activity in championships of league and domestic glass, and shocks of high level in European glasses as Champions League.
Him the experience joins the previous thing with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifying rounds of the Euroglass and the World cup of soccer.
The Costa Rican soccer players, on the contrary, possess an international rubbing limited in an area, like the Concacaf, that the FIFA is considered to be that of lower level.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection belongs to the archer Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exdoorman Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral frill of the Barcelona, possesses 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by the UEFA along with other centenaries of the Iberian team, said Zubizarreta with 126 and the battering-ram of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary number Carles Puyol is, with 97 games.
They follow him Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
Of the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umaña, they are the side lefthander Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After there, only five overcame 30 parties: Keilor Plain mountains with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain there appear Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Of the national side, with less than 30 presences, they appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not approach at 20 a.m.
While alone Nacho Moreal has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar possesses only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson does not make debut yet.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 reveilles, continued by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more so many people with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie y Parks.
Quintet included to the country in its tour of celebration of two decades of trajectory
"To go to Costa Rica is a made sleep reality"
In exclusive interview with Alive, the bassist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday, in the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band makes sure that for them also it will be to turn in fact the sleep of touching in the country.
This way it was assured by the bassist and charter member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusive with Alive, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour of celebration of two decades of work and on Sunday, the 20th it will do its only scale in Central America.
This day m will appear in the National Stadium, from 7:30 p., along with the band angelina The X and the nationals of The Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, which finished transcription is in The Nation in Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, a made sleep is a reality that Pearl Jam is going to touch in Costa Rica: are they conscious of what its fans are living?
To go to Costa Rica is a made sleep reality for us also.
This is scarcely our second time in South and Central America and till now it has been grand.
I have been in Costa Rica alone once and of holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I believe that we are going to be able to remain a few days there.
So it thrills to us to take our music there.
I wonder it because a devotion species exists towards the band, the fans live with intensity through the previous days.
What do they say to its most fervent followers?
Thanks for remaining next to us across all these years.
It took to us almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica; thanks for having waited so much and we are sorry that so much time has taken us in coming even there.
Some people even already refer to its concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does he add that a little of pressure to its visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we have touched during the last 21 years happened during the last pair of weeks.
We touch a pair of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope that that should have put us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we are very eager touch there.
We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is between the best of the world.
How was it that they discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfear?
We have many friends who are surfeadores and I have a big friend who lives in Tamarind and the waves there are incredible.
My friends were always going away to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, there are big places for surfear; like that it was how we find out, by means of the people who loves the surfing.
On having seen the tour, they have come delivering enormous shows with many songs.
What have they planned for its presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have touched there earlier ever, then we do not have any restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good songs variety; we will try to touch a pair of songs of every album and to give to our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
To what does this owe?
I believe that it is partially because we have nine discs and can touch more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs to touch every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take moment of not touching, that keeps us focused and also it keeps us astonished because he reminds to us the reasons for which we liked these songs and which it was possible to have forgotten to us.
That does that the show is more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that also it turns it more interesting for the people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
On having looked behind: is it difficult to believe everything what they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us I imagine that we would be in a big band of rock and to have done it for more than 20 years it does that it seems like a sleep.
We keep on counting our blessings and it thrills to us much that we could keep on doing music together.
We all love and we like to create music.
We are lucky to go to places of the world to which we always wanted to go.
The things might not be better for us.
What did mean for you having been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be a part of this group of big bands.
Amigos de Somos muy de la gente de Soundgarden, Mudhoney y Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something slightly common.
Occasionally, a band of a city arises, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands go out at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and honored of being a part of the group of Seattle.
We still touch with some of them occasionally.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we are lucky to be still friends of all of them and it honors us to be a part of this sound of Seattle that arose.
Also it is very strange that a band as that of you stays close and with the same members therefore time.
Yes, four of us we have we are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) us joined 13 years ago, which, himself, is a lot of more time of that many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all are lucky to be still alive and, in second, we all worry for the others.
We all are very nearby friends and, thanks to that, also there have been opened musical avenues that give freedom to each one of experimenting.
We entrust ourselves some to others with the music of each one and it might not be better.
Your relation with the word reputation has not been simple; nevertheless, thanks to its success, they could have done what they want.
How do they find a balance?
To since we have been growing, it has been easier to find a balance.
We insure ourselves of that not to be too much of tour because it is easy to fall down in this game of the big multitudes and of the people who loves your music.
While one should remember that the people are there for the music, that reminds to you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without taking a fancy for being a famous person and a rock to be star, something that none of us really is interested in.
How does remember its another project Mother Love Bone?
I believe that we write very good songs and at first it was something grand.
We were a band for almost three years and we never published a disc until after Andy (Andrew Woods) was dying.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so much and the most important thing is that we are still very friendly of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the incredible person that Andy was and how it was making me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to speak about music and soccer and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we miss it.
The national band The Robertas will be the manager of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know its work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why they chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent to us videos with several proposals and this was the band that more we liked, so we are eager see what can offer The Robertas in alive and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter in alive?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings it and I believe that it does it with the first thing that occurs to him.
How downward, what are its influences?
They are so many people.
Dentro de los juegos de cartas que se yo ocurren están Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, Fulano de tal, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They are so many people that he might speak the whole evening on the bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam achieved to keep the grunge excellent in spite of not being already a fashion?
I believe that all of us always feel a little disconnected of the word grunge.
When I think about her, he reminds to me the bands that I mentioned earlier, how Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who arose at the same time, and, if there is relevancy now, I believe that it is something wonderful because it is musical that he is worth while listening and bands like Mudhoney they are doing now better music that never.
At first, its music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
To what does this change owe?
It is interesting because I believe that there is a pair of songs in the new album that perhaps seem more light, but also there are songs, like The End or Just Breathe that they consider to be very dark songs although they can dream little prints.
With both, when Ed touched them to me, I cried when I listened to them and there are deeply dark songs.
I believe that when you grow and there is some trauma in your life and one loses a relative or a friend, these things begin influencing your art and your music and these two songs, undoubtedly, represent that for me.
Also, I believe that it is possible to be a happy person and nevertheless to be able to do music that is dark.

At 15.30 hours the police went up to 35 of the street of Mont-ral, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed that four persons were gaining access to the building.
The four were detained in the moment.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide with the opportunity of the call beyond polemics on fees
The municipal contest on 16 doors re-opens the debate on the Collserola role in Barcelona
Amediados of the 80, in full climax of already extinct Corporación Metropolitana of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a few satirical posters of promotion of Collserola.
The leaflet was defining the mountain as the big park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, he was accompanying himself of a comparison, in numbers, on Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was located again, in the imaginary one of many, like the top limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few ones that do not face in the axis north - south but there arrives (mountain) - below (sea).
The qualification of Collserola like nature reserve redounds to this idea.
La referencia ya ninguna era Parque Central Yellowstone sino, engañe los jabalís papel en el-del oso Yogui.
In these one was until, in September, the town hall summoned a megacompetition composed by 16 contests for some other doors of access to Collserola.
A door sends to the idea of park, undoubtedly.
Or that or someone tries to put doors to the field.
The question goes out alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The contest, so much for its slope merely organizational as since he supposes of reflection on the city it is the conversation topic between all the architects of Barcelona.
A topic is almost already an appellant whom to give hand when two members of this ancient caste of chosen are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives cause, exactly, for one of few coincidences between what three architects of Barcelona think, and university teachers, that they have presented before themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is opportune.
For Roldán, after the coastal front is tackled "it becomes necessary" to debate on "the front of mountain", every time the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to depart from the base of which the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Between other things for its big accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", pronounces himself the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" shuts a "lexical pitfall" up: it is not necessary to think about them "like the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of a few areas where it is necessary to act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the town-planning world, qualifies the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Derivative dangers of "uncertain that is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80 and that it had in the area of the Forum "its singing of the swan".
The first fear is the proper delimitation of a few borders on where it is possible to construct.
"To limit something is already to fix the following step", that is to say, its I exceed.
"It is necessary to think about new town-planning instruments, of planning, because the current ones [in reference to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] they can give cause for authentic disasters".
More surrounded to the question, Mòdol thinks that, simplifying, the slope vallesana of Collserola "it can be understood like a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a question merely topographic.
Mòdol remembers that there exists already a work done by Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall down in broken sack", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its union of intervening in this project "from the first moment".
And moreover, it understands that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that allows to the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if it is this technical profile the one that must lead the multidisciplinary teams (it aims at "the whole wise move") that have had to create: "The architects we should be alone a tool".
Bayonne hints that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest a global Collserola vision is missing: "Mountain - sea have summoned 16 transverse contests - he says - in the sense, but there does not exist a longitudinal reading, which it sees and the area deals with its set".
It provokes, at least in its case, which has chosen to take part in 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door of nearby.
In its opinion, of course, the town hall should guarantee that the stripe immediately superior to the Round of Dalt should foresee, in all its extension, an area of equipments that was carrying a soft transition out between the city and the green thing.
Casino excuses Jonás Larrazábal and it will go out freely
After 72 days of rooting, the legal proxy of the Casino Network granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was following him for supposed blackmails
After prisoner remains 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will go out at large after that the legal proxy of the Casino Network will grant him the pardon before Judged Segundo Penal of District, which continues a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the offense to the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Network, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photos and videos in which supposedly Manuel Jonás was demanding from him the payment of an economic quota so that the town hall of Monterrey should allow the clandestine operation of the house of bets.
After the public denunciation, the state Lawyer's office opened a penal process against the brother of the mayor panista and on September 2 it was stopped and established for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Attorney General 3 in Hereditary Crimes, was moved to the House of Rooting 1 located in the Ancient Quarter of the capital of the State.
In this place there remained during 49 following days to there was dictated the second restriction order after which the agent of the Attorney General was rejecting the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19 there was moved to the Cadereyta penalty supposedly for blackmailing with one million and a half pesos the owners of the Casino Network; nevertheless, only it remained a few hours in the prison of medium-sized safety since death threats existed in its against.
The authorities allowed him to continue the judgment interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás of the Heron.
On October 25 apprehension order was turned by the secretary of Judged Segundo Penal of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that to almost two months of inquiries enough tests were verified to determine the Jonás guilt, such as the cashing of 1.5 millions in weight to the representatives of the house of bets in exchange for allowing the operation of the same one.
This Monday, the legal Casino proxy Network, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came before the juzgador José Luis Pecina to request the pardon for the brother of the royal mayor; therefore in the next hours it might recover its freedom.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the Attorney General assigned to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the associates the bets house it was the one that granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the records 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and from now on any claim will not be able to appear concerning the process that was following him; in addition to that damage repair will not be demanded from him I do not even punish.
After the hearing to the legal proxy of the house of bets, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordained.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved up to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolás of the Heron to notify Jonás who has been excused legally and its records will be filed.
Also it will notify it of the order of immediate freedom that the judge expressed.
Secretary Dionysius Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where there lost the life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more persons
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results thrown on the accident where there lost the life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more persons, indicate that the helicopter was overawed in a direct way on the area in finished structural integrity, without the pilot c try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysius Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that, before detaching the airship, the pilot stated that the climate conditions were adapted to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the area, the sails had contact with trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
Also he informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, for what was provided with the necessary requests to transport to the personnel.
Also, he said that in the investigations done in the area of the impact the pieces appearance is not brought in the area.
"In a search it are informed that there are no pieces or components of the ship in another place, the impact appeared of structural form.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it was relying on with requests adapted for trasportar to the passengers.
The area presents a slope of seven grades to 30 inclination grades.
For the time being, the secretary made sure that it is a priority to be provided with the results earlier possible; nevertheless, the investigation can last several months, it even could reach one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, director-general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, made sure that at the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential staff was operating in cruise speed and that this happened in an ascending soft area.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal operation of cruise at the moment of the impact", it expressed.
In the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, enumerated six element excellent in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aeronautical normatividad the flight was realized under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the area.
Conditions meteorological:
The reports in the AICM were locating conditions adapted to the blast-off, the same way as it advances the airship towards the neighboring area between the DF and the State of Mexico cloudiness layers were appearing to low height.
Chosen routes:
It is probable that for the cloudiness conditions the crew has looked for an area of less elevation and major visibility towards the Cuernavaca vale.
Place of the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last record of the airship of the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration in the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of remains of the airship in a limited area:
The available information until now they allow to suppose that the impact happened in a straight trajectory and of side.
The boss of dispersion of remains of the airship they allow to suppose that the helicopter was overawed in the area in conditions of structural integrity.
There has not been detected evidence of fire or explosion:
In the place of the catastrophe they continue without revealing evidences to him in the remains of the ship of any type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that it could have had multiple contacts with the area.
During the field works pieces of the airship have been to an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet on the average level of the sea, the area presents a slope that goes from seven grades up to 30 grades of inclination.
The photos show the sequence in which most likely it was dismantled along the above mentioned trip.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts in the area.
After the meticulous search in an area wider than the cordoned off place, about the accident, dispersed pieces of the airship have not been, what strengthens the presumption of which the impact appeared in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
An investigation directs the Welfare to discover the gene of the obesity in children and young people; it is supported in specialists of the IPN
The Mexican Institute of the Welfare (IMSS) announced that it directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in children and young, named protocol 'Genetics of the obesity of the infancy and the adolescence', that will allow to rely on with scoreboards associated with the excess weight.
In a bulletin, the chief of the Unit of Medical research in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical center XXIst Century, Miguel Cruz López, told that there integrated a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutriólogos and social workers.
The above mentioned team is supported by specialists and pupils of postgraduate course of the National Institute of Public health (INSP) and of the Research center and of Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic school (IPN).
In the investigation one invites to inform the population be or not a rightful claimant, to come to the taking part sports units of the IMSS in the Vale of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, every Saturday from 8:00.
He emphasized that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (the State of West Mexico) and that from October 8, the activity is carried out in the Sports Unit Nezahualcóyolt (the State of Mexico Faces).
Once there is fulfilled the target to assemble 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independence (south of the Federal district) and finally in the Sports Unit them Reside (to the north of the Federal district).
He told that the intention of this investigation is to know the components and the importance of the genetics with regard to the development of the obesity and to identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prepare the illnesses appearance chronically degenerative.
After the World Day of the Diabetes was celebrated this November 14, he added that the target is to assemble three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the assent and supervision of its parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on feeding.
Also one will ask them on the physical activity and precedents heredofamiliares of illnesses, with the intention of avoiding factors of risk that unleash sufferings as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
There detailed that every Saturday there are applied to all the participants anthropometric measurements (weight, it carves, waist circumference), it takes of blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglicéridos, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one thinks about how to identify genes that collaborate to the infantile obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation obeys the worry of the professionals of the health for the alarming increase of weight in the minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 they pointed out that in only six years there was an increase, in case of the children, 77 per cent in obesity, and of the 47 per cent girls; in excess weight terms also a dramatic ascent was observed', stood out the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated that the justification for the search of the scoreboards is sustained in that the population of the country differs from others for its genetic history.
He informed that in average, the Mexican has 65 Indian per cent of heredity American, 30 per cent African European and five per cent and this condition is reflected in the genes that collaborate to diabetes and excess weight.
He told that in a general way, the genetics of the obesity is translated in the incapability to burn the energy excess that we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the shape of fat.
The investigator told that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, what it allows to detect if they present some grade of excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of creases of obscure color (acantosis) in neck and forearm, that they indicate the probability of which he should endure metabolic alterations and up to prediabetes.
The information manages of confidential form, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, to whom there are explained each of the measurements and the changes in the life style that they must realize to prepare illnesses.
Cruz López told that there exist three main components that cause excess weight, obesity and other chronic sufferings: the sedentarismo, which is the absence of daily physical activity, to remain most of the day sat opposite to the TV set and to use transport means instead of traveling short distances.
Also there owes to the high caloric ingestion, that is to say, the biggest consumption of sugary drinks, of carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high content in fats and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid holes
Rafael Herrera, investigator of the faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a miscellany with better performance, independently of the environmental conditions and of temperature
If the signs that the paving sends should attend, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand holes every raining season in the Metropolitan area of the Vale of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, investigator of the faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who made sure that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt paving is the suitable one, the holes might diminish in quantity or, enclosed, be eliminated completely.
In its conference A technological opinion about the holes, dictated in the frame of the International Year of the Chemistry, announced that the laboratory to its charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a miscellany with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with a major mechanical resistance, so much to high as to low temperatures.
Farrier Nájera thought that this type of modified asphalts might be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, like some cities of the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of holes.
He told that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, some of high molecular weight, calls asfaltenos, and others of low molecular weight, calls maltenos, that meetings give him to the paving its characteristic behavior viscoelástico.
The behavior viscoelástico of the asphalt consists of the fact that to high temperatures, close to 180 grades, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrade its stickiness is very high and to 50 degrees centigrade it presents the almost solid state, while to very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes fragile, it added.
The previous thing means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but it is modified during the day in accordance with the environmental conditions and of temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The investigator of the FQ observed that the streets of the Mexico City mostly are covered by flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve to the asphalt.
Between the most superficial layers there is the asphalt folder shaped by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compactadas.
Each of the piedritas who constitutes the folder, it pointed, is bathed by asphalt.
After the vehicles to journey and after efforts are generated, this one allows the forces to spread very well in the paving.
If it was a question of modified asphalt they would spread even better, thought the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, there places a last layer called folder of rolling, which is done of a thin stone material, that is to say, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
Since it is a question of the layer that is going to be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force that the asphalt folder and to provide friction in the way.
The part of the paving that is going to receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder needs from the being, also, to have the suitable thickness and it is necessary to take care of the material of the one that is made.
The climate, especially the moisture and the changes of temperature, also there are a very important factor to be considered, especially the water, he said, because it affects greatly the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the area becomes damp, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult that it goes out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the paving and, therefore, the formation of holes.
In the process of formation of a hole, he said, the first one in getting worn is the bearing movie and only later the asphalt folder falls ill, but the damage does not happen instantaneously, but it is a process that should be attended on the first signs with suitable maintenance programs.
Also member of the National System of Investigators told that the transport load is another important factor in the holes formation and, for it, the thickness of each of the layers of the paving must always go as regards the transport load and guarantee that it is fulfilled, to prevent from forming holes often.
Rafael Herrera warned that it still exists much that to investigate and to work on the asphalt, for example, the asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already enclosed on the market and allow to repair the holes with facility and without need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Vale lack to be new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected so that Melina Ramírez Serna was not reaching Miss's crown Colombia.
The Vale receives its title number 14 of princess.
Again the Vale of the Cauca remains with the desire of Miss's crown Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to be in the winners' podium, to show the silver crown and the band that credit it like new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where miss lifted the Atlantic Ocean with the already supreme crown and the scepter, the department 14 qualifications of Princess and Melina one to the women's legion vallecaucanas that have been close to the crown but that were proclamations princesses between them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Elizabeth Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask to themselves it is: What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite who in every presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be new Miss Colombia, not in vain she was elected a Queen of the Police and Better Face Jolie de Vogue, qualifications that there obtained queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took Miss's crown Colombia.
The first factor that the jury considers to be a key in the decision that it took of the First Princess designates it takes root in that he did not convince with its answer to the question: "What is this book that has marked you and why? done by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Wagon let's Read.
The vallecaucana answered to the interrrogante:
"I read very much, believe enough in the literature, believe that it is a form of culturalizarse, definitely I believe that the book that marked me with infancy is "The principito", it is a quite deep book.
At present I read "Crime and punish", it is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and nowadays I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, the most beautiful book that is called "The ardor of the blood"".
An answer that little pleased first for the term "culturalizarse" and the second for not explaining of way I limit with what way each of the books that he quoted have marked it.
But on having finished the ceremony Melina, it showed to feel calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise it happens what it has to spend.
And for all the people, please read a bit, "The principito" is a big book"
Between the thrown hypotheses it is said that to Vale the favor burned it.
A journalist of Bogotá hinted that to the being the darling, the ovacionada and the candidate who was taking all the preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote of the public for the best handmade suit, and Mother Reigns), "that woke up the jealousy of other candidates, estresó to the queen and that's why it did not shine in the stage".
And that was evident in its first presentation in swim suit in the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the coronation party.
Although in both it seemed sure, one noticed that he was lacking the force and the impetus that Magdalen's representatives and the Atlantic Ocean yes demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "As at home", of the Channel RCN thought that the fact that Melina was a designated princess "he verifies that the candidate who gains more awards during the contest does not stay as he reigns".
Also, Vale appeared to the last thing very shy with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Vale did not achieve to convince the jury on its interest towards the social work, which is in last, the extract of the National Contest of Beauty.
For something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking a woman compromised with the social needs for its country.
"Colombia is not enough the alone beauty in a Miss, it is necessary to look beyond the physical thing and to center on its social sensibility, which, before entering to the Contest, they are already involved in projects", he told.
Also one speculates that Vale sinned for its defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was evident him in its abdomen, but it turns out to be contradictory since precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good feeding and responsible physical work.
The queens' trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, which existed better, "but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very well-known, lowered his points in the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Chromium thinks that the error of the vallecaucana there were the operations that were practised.
"The surgeries are well, but Vale could not do them to itself.
Its body was never its fortress and here they received it from themselves".
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Contest of the Beauty, after the parade in swim suit there arose a cruel forecast that yesterday evening was fulfilled, since it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo was granting him to Melina not to be a pleasure for him of the crown.
Reality or not, the true thing is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not like sovereign, but like princess, position that offers to him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international contests for designation of the proper National Contest.
Nevertheless, she will go down in history like one of the queens who in spite of its sweeping step along Cartagena, him was shy the crown.
Like that was the work of the caleño that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopista of Cali went down in history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4 a lofoscopista of the CTI of Cali went down in history like the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", across the collation of its fingerprints.
Of seven lofoscopistas that work in the sectional one of the CTI, this week was touching him the shift of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man of Port Tejada that takes 21 years working in the field of judicial investigation.
On having initiated its career, González was employed at municipalities of the Chocó, where often he had to penetrate for more than five days in the forest to come to the place in which there were the corpses that must be identified.
In 2000 it moved to the capital of the Vale and, after realizing the corresponding courses, it specialized in lofoscopia, that is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say, of the palms of the hands and of the feet.
The week of the operative one against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar they warned that it should take clothes minimum for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday in the night it left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that it had to identify two corpses and that it was suspected that one of them belonged to the man who was directing to the most ancient guerrillas of the world, therefore they asked him to take the card decadactilar of Guillermo León Sáenz (its real name).
Nevertheless, when it came with the team of investigation to the place in which the corpse was he did not recognize it as its physical aspect, since it was very different from the one that it had seen in the mass media.
It was without beard, garment like a peasant of the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the traces do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, stained, a transplantador and a lantern, Eliazar compared the digital impressions of the corpse with those of the card.
Its eye did not trump him: he was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, the man native to Port Tiled was the manager of confirming to him the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that yes it was a question of the maximum chief of the Farc.
In search of the trace
For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín of Cali the recognition that the president Juan Manuel Santos did to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operative one against "Pipe", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
The fingerprinting is an exact science, without margin of error, which can become a key in the crimes resolution.
Apart from the corpses identification, the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes like robbery and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are captured, many delinquents present false certificates or have no roles.
We take the digital impression to them and look for them in the database.
The investigator told that, in a case of robbery, it had him to remove a piece of wall of a house, since in this place the thief had supported its hand to extract a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because surfaces are not adapted to extract a digital impression, but in this case we could obtain the trace of the whole hand and identify the delinquent, who had taken part in different robberies", he remembered.
The traces also can discard or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Not long ago they found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
By means of the investigation one determined that a relative might be a suspect of the crime and, really, a trace with the bottle was coinciding.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the killer, yes it locates it in the scene of the crime.
A dactiloscopista of the CTI told that in the objects "the traces are extracted by chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplantador or tape is used to raise them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the database delincuencial, or to the Registraduría.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", indicated the expert of the CTI.
It clarified that not everything is as it appears in the television program CSI.
As well as not everything what shines is a gold, not quite what touches turns trace.
Nevertheless, if it can be used, if the respective collation is realized.
The "indignant ones" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were crowding before the square Zuccotti to camp.
A big part attended to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the movement It Occupies Wall Street they defied this Tuesday the authorities of New York on having tried to enter again, under the cover of a judicial order, to the square of Manhattan from which they were evicted at dawn and on having tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were crowding before the square Zuccotti, where they wanted to gain access thanks to a judicial order that allows to the "indignant ones" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement answered to the eviction occupying one more park to the north of the city, where there have been new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we are going to settle in some another place and we will continue the legal battle for returning to Zuccotti, as well as across sittings and pacific declarations", said one of the spokesmen of the movement "It occupies Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the answer of "infuriated" to the eviction of its camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, it came up to the courts, where the jueza Lucy Billings expressed an order that was prohibiting the local necessary evacuation and was allowing to the demonstrators to stay motorhome.
Also, the "indignant ones" proceeded to the occupation of a new park placed in the confluence of central Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entry to the tunnel Holland, which joins New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for one hour they managed to occupy the place, but later the Police came and proceeded to stop some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete number, while he made sure Efe that it saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization makes sure that there are several hundreds of persons those who had settled in this point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support sample to the members of the movement and which has tried to come up with the Police.
Meanwhile, the square Zuccotti - that is a private ownership enclosure - remains closed in expectation of the celebration of a judicial sight foreseen for the same Tuesday in which it is necessary to analyze the legality of the evacuation of this dawn.
Some of the demonstrators displaced even there were carrying and distributing at these hours copies of this judicial order and even were delivering them to the agents who were guarding the square, what provoked "some small clashes", indicated Bray, who denounced that some officials gave blows to the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evict the members of Ocupa Wall Street or to apply "laws that were published after it was beginning the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators to gain access again to the park with shops or other properties that they were using previously".
Mayor Bloomberg indicated before the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, whom it alerted, nevertheless, that the local laws do not allow them to turn to install with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor defended personally the eviction carried out at dawn of the square Zuccotti, an operation in which one proceeded to about 200 detentions and which was decided because the demonstrators were "violating the law".
Bloomberg told that it gave the order to evacuate the square because this one was turning "into a place in which the persons were not coming to protest, but to violate the laws and, in any cases, to hurt other persons", since "some business had received threats" and the neighbors were afraid "for its quality of life".
"The eviction of this dawn was disgusting and it demonstrates that in the fund Bloomberg it is more interested in preserving the financial interests that those of the American workpeople", added the spokesman of the movement, who the respect accused the mayor of "of being missing to the freedom of expression".
The persons in charge of "It occupies Wall Street" indicated also that they think to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate two months that there last the protests, which began on September 17.

The channel deprived of television CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other out-standing Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed today images of the television program in which Anderson also known by the wide distribution in Internet of a pornographic home-made video in which it appears together with its husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, turns out to be dressed like Virgin Mary supporting in a manger a doll that represents Jesus.

Japan is reborn after the earthquake
The GDP grows a 1,5 % thanks to the domestic consumption and finishes the spiral of falls that initiated in March
From the last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that occurred into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that endured the Japanese country from the Second World War.
The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo coded the material losses in 300.000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have weakened.
After three consecutive falls trimesters, the fact of the Gross National Product between July and September served to spend page, definitely: the GDP increased a 1,5 % compared to the previous trimester and 6 % in valuation anualizada.
The registered one in the second trimester - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March, 2012 - supposes, also, the biggest growth rhythm from the period from January until March, 2010.
The recovery is explained, partly, by the upturn of the buy of machinery to restore the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the later tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased its investments in a 1,1 %, opposite to the descent of 0,9 % in capital expenses that was observed from January until March, the first regression after six months of uninterrupted increases.
Nevertheless, the real revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse of that he invites to make use of the crises to reinforce - or reconstruct - the infrastructures, make use of the lacks to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up, especially, thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, which at present there represents 60 % of the Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed a 1 %, pushed by the increase of the expense in vehicles, trips and activities of free time.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has turned into one of the "values I shelter" chosen by the investors who flee of the debt crisis in the Euro area and the cloudy forecasts of the USA, a privilege that weighs like a flagstone in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products turn out to be more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country which line of economic flotation is determined by the health of the big technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, imputed its dweebs turned out between July and September to the quotation of the yen.
While the markets continue with its siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the custody.
"It is necessary to be attentive to the risks that persist, like the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", pointed out yesterday the secretary of the State of Economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in effect, the perspectives do not turn out to be encouraging.
The Organization for the Cooperation and the Economic Development (OCDE) added that most of the member countries presented in September clearer signs of economic slowing down.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the world economy emphasized that the main potency is braked.
Since it lowered four tenths up to 100,4 points, opposite to August 100,8.
The Euro area, even, was located below the average, which finds in the level 100, on having rushed eight tenths up to 99,13 points.
Athens feeds the doubts again
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the shot off peripheral insurances and the suspense reinstalled in the parquets, Greece keeps on being mischievous in the labyrinth that he leads towards the exit of the big crisis of European debt.
The sensation that the "consensus" of the new Hellene Transition government is more imposed by the requirements of Brussels that by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, was warning yesterday that there is no alternative for the structural reforms and that the period of hundred days agreed in its designation perhaps should remain short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, he was making sure that it will not endorse new austerity measurements in any case and he repeated its demand of new elections for the due date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summit of October 26", it affirmed Papadimos on having opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will reach tomorrow with a vote of confidence the new Executive.
A bundle with 24 programs to impel the employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of the officials and new measurements against the tax evasion there will be the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the Samaras message does not clear the doubts about its position: "We have promised to help to the Transition government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more".
The conservative leader was a step further in its pulse to the EU and the IMF, the organisms that must unblock 8.000 millions that Athens needs promptly, and he made clear that will not give its approval to any engagement letter of fulfillment of the adjustments.
Pero la Comisión Europea, stung still by the impact provoked by the órdago of the referendum of Papandreu, repeated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the help if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellene parties do not sign "a commitment written without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman of Economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, told that the inspectors of the troika will return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth stretch" of 8.000 millions, although neither there is definitive date.
The Greek skein still has thread for moment.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for the progress and the hope"
The Queen emphasizes the "preponderant" place of Spain as regards this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place on a global scale in the role of the Microfinance".
The Queen Queen Sofia remembered yesterday that the country has turned in these last two decades into the second donor of the plantea as regards this intrumento of cooperation, which "extract" pointed out that it takes root in being a "instrument for the best social progress, the justice and the hope of a future for the whole humanity, based on the confidence in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday V World Summit of the Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction of which "there is no doubt" of which it is type of operations they are "absolutely indispensable" to reach the Targets of the Millenium established by United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "much especially, in that one that takes the reduction as a goal to half of the volume of persons who live with income lower than a daily dollar, with in the one that fixes the "threshold of poverty".
Spain "keeps on working" to extend the beneficiaries' network "to all the corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", pointed out Queen Sofia, that he hoped that the initiatives and contributions that should originate in the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "should guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for the women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "a lot of reached achievements" and "a lot of challenges which we face".
The Summit of the Microcredit appears not only like a debate forum, but also like the platform from which to impel "two basic goals".
This way, your Majesty told that one aspires that at the end of 2015 175 are the million poor families that have gained access to these financial services and that hundred million of these hearths go out of the threshold of poverty in which they are plunged.
The impulse in the conception of the microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has continued the footpath initiated years ago of pioneering form" for Muhammad Yunus, I stand out Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And the fact is that it described the father of this tool as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the struggle against the poverty", whose work knows for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the area its loans politics.
To this experience they continued one year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings as celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I could have stated the continuous evolution", there explained your Majesty, whose tie with this project cost him yesterday the epithet of the "head of the family" congregated in Valladolid on the part of "baquero of the poor".
Finally, the Queen Queen Sofia concluded its intervention cheering up to the presents to take part in the debate and in the search of solutions to advance in the struggle against the poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The minister of Foreign affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, it exhibited that it would be an error to link the cooperation with developing countries to epochs of economic fair weather, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez thought that the microcredits suppose "a serious and rigorous politics dedicated to eradicating the poverty", and now "more that never" the developed country governments must work under solidarity criteria and not leave that this is a victim of the clippings.
For Spain, the microcredit consists in "one of the main lines of cooperation to the development".
For his part, the State Department of International cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, he applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the persons "excluded to whom they all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, gave the welcome to the presents to a city that "opens its doors infected of the united spirit".
The CDU proposes to choose the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Union Christian - democrat (CDU), on Monday, the 14th of November, in Leipzig, has passed without big difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and the President of the divided Christian - democrat.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the topic was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who think that the politics of the Government is at present too slightly strict with the Greeks and it it might be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted practically as unanimity.
Of 1.001 delegates, only nine votes registered in against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that earned, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the eurófilo the Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, they are summed up in a motto: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but any more Europe".
Not only because Europe supposes the peace, but also because "nine million work places depend straight on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "there has come the hour of opening way in Europe".
This might be evident in modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon to allow to reinforce the control of the European Union on the budgetary politics of the countries of the area of the euro, although also it might end in the election of the President of the European Commission for universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted as the Congress, clearly it designs of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it turns out to be slightly probable that the twenty-seven come quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain proves to be hostile before him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the area.
On the other hand, the delegates have pushed back for a crushing majority the proposal to consider the weight of every country of the board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of every economy, which obviously would reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxious for calming the fortitudes inside its party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither it is not that European countries have tried to be gained to its congress at the cost of the "children" or of the ready countries to criticize the arrogant Germany in difficulties.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of franco-German "friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except of spent.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the Napoleón army.
The incidence of the fraud in the sick leaves
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government tackle an offensive against the sick leaves.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, the 15th of November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for the familiar subsidies and to pronounce a speech on the topic, already appellant from 2007, of the struggle against the social fraud and the assistantship.
Also, to accompany such an offensive, which departs from the will to save of rigorous form, but nevertheless he resembles an axis of the presidential campaign of rights, the majority wants to center on the sick leaves.
First of all, to apply budgetary clippings: the Government foresees to impose on the workpeople of the private sector the fourth day of lack before being able to take the fall.
Finally, unless a specific company agreement exists, a worker that patient falls down would lose four days of salary, that is to say, a minimum of 15 % of its monthly income.
It is a question of a measurement that might raise an anger wave, but that would allow to save 280 million euros, as They Echos.
Also, it would go accompanied by another measurement with a more symbolic scope: to impose on the officials a day of lack without remuneration in case of leave (until now, they have no lack, opposite to three days that are applied in the private sector).
While these questions are debated, the majority puts again on the table the same way the topic of the fraud, this time faced towards the abuses of the leaves.
"The control panel is going to increase greatly and, also, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, it will have to reimburse the quantities", warned Xavier Bertrand speaking in the RTL on Sunday, the 13th of November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem lightly disproportionate for the reality of the fraud on the subject of leaves.
In fact, from 2002 a constant pursuit of this question is realized and there have been taken the diverse political offensives that, normally, have born fruit.
The French do not fall ill any more than in the rest of Europe.
Let's observe with attention, first of all, the national numbers.
According to the French Institute of the social security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros subscribed in services for leaves.
According to the French Institute of investigation and papers in health economics, the subsidies for the falls represented, in 2008, 5 % of the sanitary expense, amounting to 11.300 million euros.
Of this sum, 46 % corresponds to the casualties for maternity and for industrial accidents, while 54 % is related to the sick leaves, codes that it amounts to 6.200 million euros.
Consequently, 2,5 % of the expense in health.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14,5 days of leave, opposite to 17,8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting.
An average that, undoubtedly, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management Monster.com, was showing that 75 % of 40.000 French wage earners interrogated persons were affirming that they had taken not even only one day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37 % of the sick leaves had a duration lower than 8 days, 22 % of between 8 and 14 days, 15 % of between 15 days and one month, 15 % of between one and three months and 11 % was more long.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, the French workpeople are not more inclined than in other areas to take sick leaves.
A long study realized in 2010 by two investigators of the CNRS was indicating that, between 1994 and 2001, the valuation of global absence of the work (so much for reasons of health as of another type) was ranging, in France, between 10 % and 11 %, opposite to 20 % and 28 % in Denmark, 15 % in the United Kingdom or between 16 % and 18 % in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the sick leaves does not turn out to be especially significant compared to not declared work.
The fraud has a quite limited scope.
The reinforcement of the legislation, from 2002, has provoked that the control panel of the sick leaves of more than 45 days is systematical.
In 2008, of 1,5 million examinations, the CNAM verified, in 13 % of the 285.000 realized ones, that the falls of short duration were "unjustified or too long" that is to say, 37.050 cases.
In case of the falls of more than 45 days, submitted to systematical examinations, it was considered that 11 % of the cases was "properly adapted or unjustified; a number that, taking a whole of 1,2 millions as a game, promotes 132.000.
Consequently, there is reached a whole of 169.000 "unjustified" cases between several million workpeople who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant number in comparison, for example, with the work in black.
According to the deputy of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this question in June, the above mentioned practice would represent a few losses of fiscal income of between 9.000 and 15.000 million euros a year, that is to say, more than the entire cost of the subsidies for falls and, undoubtedly, greatly more than the fraud in the latter ambience.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy up.
This is what he declared on Monday, the 14th of November, the Prime minister Lucas Papadémos before to the Parliament; he added also that hundred days that have granted its union Government to themselves would not be enough to reach such a target.
"To realize efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European associates and a new budget settlement program", the Chief of the Government declared, that it was pronouncing its first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament on Wednesday.
The execution of the decisions adopted during the Summit of the area of the euro on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "it is in game" the permanence of the country in the area of the euro, was added by him.
Consequently, Papadémos has foreseen that the budget deficit of the country will diminish "even about 9 %" of the GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10,6 % in 2010 and 15,7 % in 2009.
The right pushes new austerity measurements back
Antonis Samaras, the chief of the group of rights, showed on Monday its support to the measurements already approved to try to go out of the crisis of the debt, but he has warned that its party will not commit itself with additional austerity measurements.
"We will not vote in favor of new measurements", he affirmed during a meeting with the deputies of its party "New Democracy".
It pointed out that it was agreeing with the targets of reduction of the deficit and of the debt, as well as of struggle against the waste, but against any politics that prevents the economic recovery.
Commissioner Europeo of Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan for 8.000 million euros without a written guarantee of the support of all the parties to the due measurements, Antonio Samaras has answered to Olli Rehn that its word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of the external pressure.
An experts' committee affirms that the euthanasia and the assisted suicide must be legalized
The Canadians live denying the death, as indicates the report of the Real Society of Canada
On the subject of palliative care, the committee claims that the governments, the institutions of health care and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the best palliative care, and not only in the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives denying the death.
In fact, only 9 % of the Canadians is ready to speak with its doctor on the conditions in which they want to die and take dispositions to that end.
It is a question of one of the conclusions of a formless depositor of the Real Society of Canada, which was provided with the participation of six experts of diverse ambiences, including the ethical one, the juridical one and the doctor.
This committee recommends to the Government to modify the Penal code so that the assisted suicide and the euthanasia is allowed, when the patient raises the above mentioned option and has been a competent court to take the decision.
To begin, the experts quote a recent survey of Economist Intelligence Unit who compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada fills the tenth vacancy, the study points out that "the medicalización of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the persons are afraid of treating the topic of the death".
With medication or not, 77 % of the Canadians has no access to palliative care, as indicate the experts selected by the Real Society of Canada.
And, although most of the Canadians want to die at home, their 68,6 % ends up by dying in the hospital.
As a whole, the highest valuation in this sense registers Québec, where 86 % of the deaths takes place in the hospital.
In the relative thing to the delicate topic of the euthanasia and of the assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to a few conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already declared that he does not want to modify the Penal code as regards the euthanasia and the assisted suicide.
Nevertheless, according to the experts, who also have studied the situation in all the countries where the above mentioned practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offense, there is no proof that the fact that there are not considered to be a criminal offense there has not provoked an abuse of its application, that is to say, the use of the euthanasia or of the suicide assisted with not competent persons or that they had not given its assent.
Jocelyn Downie, coauthor of the report, was affirming yesterday for teleconferencing that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where neither the euthanasia nor the assisted suicide have been legalized.
"In Canada the euthanasia is practised, although it is clearly illegal".
"In Canada he practises the assisted suicide on himself, although it is clearly illegal", tells Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians favorable to the euthanasia
Let's remember that 85 % of the Canadians has already declared himself in favor of the euthanasia, since they think that it would allow to the persons whose death is next to relieve its suffering, as indicates a survey of Angus Reid realized in 2010.
Also, 66 % believes that the fact of legalizing the euthanasia will not give to understand that the life of the aged or disabled persons has less value.
As for the persons who have practised the assisted suicide, 41 % of the interrogated persons thinks that a process should not begin against them.
As regards the maintenance or interruption of the health care to a patient, the situation does not turn out to be so clear, as indicate the authors of the report.
Also, between its recommendations they suggest to be indicated in the Penal code that the retreat of the sanitary care, if they have been pushed back legally, does not suppose a criminal offense.
The experts' committee asks also him to form the sanitary professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient pushes the assistance back at the end of its life without fear of facing a denunciation.
On the subject of palliative care, the committee claims that the governments, the institutions of health care and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the best palliative care, and not only in the cases of cancer.
Finally, as regards the palliative or terminal sedation, which is already used extensively in the sanitary institutions of Canada, the committee asks that, unless it should serve to reduce the physical pain, should be considered to be an euthanasia and should surrender to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts of the ambience of the Right of health have already shown its reservations as regards the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in Right of the health, has qualified of "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, between other things because the practice of the euthanasia does not limit itself to the patients in terminal phase.
"This leaves the door opened for a situation in which someone who is tired of living and should have more than 18 years could ask for help to commit suicide", points out Deschamps, which consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mister Deschamps emphasizes also that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any other value of the society.
Now then, he adds that "in society, there are tags and limitations".
The specialist in Right of the health Margaret Somerville also expressed its "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which it qualified of "I show in favor of the euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, puts in judgment cloth especially the absence of abuse in certain countries where the euthanasia and the assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregón.
The king of Jordan urges the President The Asad to leave the power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is more and more isolated
The partisans of Bachar Asad demonstrated yesterday before the building of the State Department.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure was intensified on the Syria of Bachar Asad that, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that a "conspiracy" exists against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria on the part of the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have been evident in favor of the abandonment of the power for the President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked the President Bachar The Asad "to leave the power" in Syria, where they have already died a quarantine of civil and of members of the forces of the diet.
"If Bachar really worries for its country, it should resign, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of the Syrian political life", affirmed the king of Jordan, nearby country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the chief of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has been sorry that the efforts of mediation that goes realizing Turkey from the beginnings of the year with the Syrian diet have finished in a defeat.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with its peoples and could not satisfy them, will set off", he declared alluding to Syria, nearby country with regard to which Turkey is adopting a harder and harder position.
For his part, after the decisions of the Arab League and of the European Union, the United States have celebrated that "Syrian has reinforced the consensus against Asad and the performances of the diet".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, like Turkey, are adopting a harder and harder tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, points out Mark Toner, spokesman of the Department of the State.
Meanwhile, already there have lost the life 16 civil ones and at least 19 members of the forces of the diet in the region of Deraa, in the south of Syria, as he has announced the Syrian Observatory of the human rights (OSDH).
Another two civil ones have died "during bombings and shootings with machine guns weighed in Jobar" in the beleaguered city of Homs, according to the Indian above mentioned ONG.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Secretary, Walid Al Mualem, thinks for his part that the country "advances towards the end of the crisis".
Also, it has reacted firmly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend to damask of its functions, which in its opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "he will not weaken", it added, guaranteeing that "the conspiracies planned against Syria will fail".
After the decision to suspend Syria, at present the Arab League studies a "protection mechanism of civil" and wants to send 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, of the means and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Secretary, Alain Juppé, also has shown its support to the observers' mailing of the UNO to help to protect the civil ones opposite to the repression of the diet that, in its opinion, shuts itself up in the "paranoia".
It is foreseen that celebrates a new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat to put to point the application of the adopted plan of exit of the crisis on November 2 that foresees, in particular, the retreat of the armed forces of the cities that are in hands of the opposition and the liberation of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Secretary, Serguei Lavrov, has considered to be yesterday how "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China was urging Syria to apply the plan of exit of the crisis, although it was not showing its support to the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks the Italians for time to the markets and sacrifices
The future chief of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, he has asked for some time to the markets to form its team and to start a program that will include "sacrifices" destined to recover the credibility lost during the last months of Berlusconi's Government.
Ancient Commissioner Europeo debated yesterday with the political parties and today it met the trade unions and the management one.
It should form a relatively restricted office composed by external technocrats to the Parliament.
"Monti has spoken about a wide program with numerous sacrifices", affirmed Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after having met the President of the designated Advice.
For his part, the President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, has affirmed that he hopes that Mario Monti should request before Friday a vote of confidence to the Parliament to guarantee that the new Government arranges of sufficient support.
The consultations will finish with the presentation, on the part of mister Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly a dozen of the Ministers, the Head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and of the bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In the "democracy, there are a few precise period" to form a Government and to prepare its program, he stood out, adding that it is "insurance of which the markets will have patience and will understand it".
Its designation for the President initially obtained the approval of the markets, but later the worry was imposed, in particular after an unforeseen fall of the industrial production in the area of the euro in September.
The designated Prime minister should create a team principally formed by technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like including "politicians".
The new Government will have to work until 2013, date of the next legislative ones, he thinks.
According to the President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has committed himself which, when it occupies the charge, will work bearing in mind the urgency and with the target that Italy "recovers its leading role" in Europe.
A spokesman of Commissioner Europeo Olli Rehn has emphasized that "even with a new Government, it will not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its target to obtain a budgetary balance in 2013 in spite of the plans of austerity adopted during the last months, he has asked for the adoption of new measurements of rigor.
The "chief of the chiefs" Italians Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, insisted also on the need to impel the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the requisites on the subject of deficit".
Monti, famous person for its competition and its independence like Commissioner Europeo (1994-2004), supposes a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconismo"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of the seriousness" and "Another Italy", as affirm the leader writers.
The big unknown will be the longevity of its team.
The Neapolitan President wants to avoid a few early elections, since Italy has to place before April, 2012 approximately 200.000 million euros in obligations of the State.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that it is possible to use with a nuclear weapon, as he affirmed on Monday an American ONG specializing in the atomic risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute of Science and International security (ISIS) bases on a recent report of the International Agency of the Atomic energy (AIEA) and on other documents expressed by the above mentioned agency of the UNO.
The AIEA was showing last week its "serious worry" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS, being based extensively on documents of the AIEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, it would have been employed during three decades, from the year 1960, at a Soviet military nuclear center at Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have taken part in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds for explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to form a company centred on the "nanodiamond production in Kiev.
The economic problems of its company would have led him to getting in touch, in 1995, with the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
Later, one believes that he cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA mentions that they exist "clear indications of which Iran is developing" a system of nuclear detonation "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew well the skill, but also, as he has informed a Member state the Agency, it was employed during most of its career at the above mentioned technology in the military nuclear program of its fatherland".
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased 50 %
The crimes and crimes against the Muslims have increased close to 50 % between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have diminished or increased only lightly, as indicate the statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to the above mentioned numbers, the entire number of acts of violence committed against Muslims it has happened from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is to say, it has increased in 49 %, opposite to an increase of 13 % in case of the violence acts against the Catholics, a reduction of 4 % in the crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14 % in the number of crimes and antireligious crimes.
The entire number of "crimes of hate" has grown lightly up to 6.628 cases, of which 47,3 % owes racial differences and 20 % to himself to religious differences, as indicates the FBI.
"After a slope in 2009, it turns out to be worrying that they have increased again this type of crimes and crimes", stood out the organization of defense of the human rights Human Rights First, "the increase of the acts of violence against Muslims turns out to be especially significant", added the organization in a bulletin.
"Human Rights First takes a lot of time pointing out that the violence against the Muslims, as well as all the types of crimes of hate, there should be considered to be a serious human rights violation", adds a person in charge of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American Government can and must strain for finishing the above mentioned abuses", it adds, thinking that the above mentioned efforts might include a progress of the reports of the police on the "crimes of hate".
The "crime of hate" in the American federal Right was inherited of the epoch of the struggle by the civil rights.
The above mentioned legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the acts of violence linked to the race, the color of the skin, the religion, the origin and, now, the sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks alike more to Facebook
The place of microblogging Twitter modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow to its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the persons whom they follow, which provokes that its service looks alike a little more to that of Facebook.
A new eyelash "activity" and other one called "name" they allow to continue more legibly and directly the activity of other "Twittos", that is to say, of those Net users whose messages ("tweets) it continues in Internet or who follow you.
This allows to know if they give pursuit to messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify of favorite some message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was proved "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as has indicated the AFP the spokeswoman of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known by its slightly instinctive functioning, with terms lightly esoteric (RT to forward a message of another person, followfriday pour recommander of suivre an autre utilisateur) faisant him bonheur give initiés, s'ouvre ainsi bonus large avec a maniement comparable bonus to celui give réseaux grand public Facebook et Google to a public +.
In the network, the users have debated to blow of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, it turns out to be invasive and looks alike too much to Facebook", he writes @jemb123.
"The function Activity is going to help to continue to me better some elements of my flow Twitter", he writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "budgetary rule of gold" in the Constitution
The Government of big coalition socialdemócrata/democratacristiano that is in the power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "budgetary rule of gold" to reduce the budget deficit and, this way, to avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria on the part of the agencies of credit qualification (triple A).
It was the proper social-democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Cabinet, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74,6 %, a number very superior to the maximum limit of 60 % fixed by the Treaty of Maastrich, but clearly lower than the countries debts like Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was diminishing in only one level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay 3.000 million euros more in interests every year", pointed out the Vice chancellor democratacristiano of Foreign affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria answers this way to a request of the Summit of Brussels to the member countries of the area of the euro of last October 26: in her, the heads of state and of Government asked for the inclusion, before ends of 2012, of the reduction of the budget deficit and of the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted as the Austrian Government comes closer the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that adopted this type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural budget deficit should diminish every year in 0,75 % of the Gross National Product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the federal State should not overcome every year 0,35 % of the GDP, while the regional States, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The target consists of the fact that, towards 2020/2021, the public debt diminishes under the criterion of 60 % fixed by the Treaty of Maastrich.
A strong yen
Threat nonmeets on a new intervention of the market of change
The Japanese Prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again marked with the change if the yen kept on increasing.
"We will intervene, as we did it the last time, if we verify that an excessive volatile nature takes place" in the exchange rate of the yen, he told That It Nongives to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was climbing up to reaching a few levels next to the historical maxima that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yenes for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record from 1945 compared to the American currency.
But the yen has been mending gradually since then, impelled by the investors' buys that consider it to be a "value I shelter" in these uncertain times of world economic slowing down and of debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to been quoted again on Tuesday at least of 77 yenes and the euro has descended below the symbolic bar of 105 yenes, reaching a few levels next to those who provoked the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted to about 120 yenes and the euro to more than 160 yenes.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms to the exports of the archipelago, since it gets dearer the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by the Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to be reconstructed" after the earthquake and the tsunami of March 11, which they devastated the region of Tohoku (North-East), he emphasized That It Nongives, that he is afraid that the increase of the yen nips in the bud the weak recovery.
The third world economic potency has recovered the growth in the third trimester (a 1,5 % as regards the previous trimester), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase of the exports and of the consumption of the hearths affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime minister thinks that the high level of the yen was not reflecting the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, In June Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (Box), which inaugurated on Tuesday a meeting of two days of its Council of monetary policy, that I adopted all the possible measurements to debilitate the yen.
Nevertheless, the attached Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Box had already taken "the suitable measures", giving to understand that a major monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased in five trillion yenes (47.000 million euros) its Treasury bills buys, taking to 55 trillion yenes (519.000 million euros) the threshold of the funds that he dedicates to the acquisition of diverse financial qualifications to flood the liquidity market.
Area of the euro:
the types grow, the bags weaken
The risk of contagion of the crisis of the debt keeps on harming to the European indexes.
In spite of the appointment of new Chiefs of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as of a few better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the types of the most flagging countries keep on increasing.
Still worried by the stability of the stability of the area of the euro, the European bags sink a little more in the negative area on Tuesday, the 15th of November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses a 1,4 % and it is located to 3.064 points.
The Dax loses in Frankfurt 0,4 % and in London 0,1 %.
"Bearing in mind the new tensions as regards the yields of the loans of the most affected States of the area of the euro, the stock markets of the whole world keep on producing part of its recent profit".
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the contagion risk", tells Terry Pratt, institutional broker in IG Markets quoted by the agency Reuters.
The Stock Exchange of Tokyo has closed with a fall of 0,7 %, renewing the worries of the inspectors of the market as regards the aptitude of Europe to contain the crisis of the debt.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has the fixed look in Europe and the exchanges will keep on being realized in a limited changes margin, so that the investors will not have proofs that the situation has become stable", thinks Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of the worries for the future of the area of the euro fond of the single currency, which keeps on going down on Tuesday.
The euro continues in its lowest level for one month and a half.
About 10 a.m., the European currency was costing 1,3570 dollars, a fall of 0,4 %.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after the party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in the Congress, was adopting a motion that foresees, in particular, the option of which a country in difficulties was going out of the area of the euro without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types overcome fully 6 %
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at a few very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian obligations to 10 years was reaching 6,85 %, while the Spanish qualifications in the same term were offering 6,2 %.
These tensions as regards the interest rates of the countries of the south, although also of France, they keep on feeding the fears of the inspectors.
The chief of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, he has asked for time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being asphyxiated by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime minister Lucas Papademos, for his part has affirmed that the application of the decisions adopted in the Summit of the area of the euro on October 27 would be the "main work" of its Government.
Spain is in the point of view of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be celebrated there.
The difference of the types ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain, it has reached a new historical maximum.
In expectation of the numbers of growth of the area of the euro
From the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of 0,4 % in the third trimester, that is to say, a number more favorable than 0,3 % foreseen, impelled by the domestic consumption.
The Insee, nevertheless, has checked the casualty the number of the second trimester, with a reduction of 0,1 % of the Gross National Product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
Also, the fourth trimester is the one that really worries the economists.
Germany for his part, has registered a growth of 0,5 % in the same period.
The first forecasts are foreseen for the set of the area of the euro at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned on the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must cost more than the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot talk each other bearing in mind short term considerations or simply thinking about the emotions, it is the energy policy.
The availability and the cost of the electricity influence straight the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It turns out to be suitable that an electoral meeting is the moment to reflect on such questions and on the place of the nuclear energy.
The debate will only turn out to be useful if he studies the set of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base its opinion on objective facts, on rational information.
Now when we are 7.000 million persons in the planet, the demographic evolution will suppose the duplication of the electrical demand before 2050, unless it is deprived to an enormous part of the world population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to relieve the every time major scarcity of the fossil resources to keep on producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperious need to reduce the greenhouse effect gas emission to fight against the climate change, a topic that has disappeared of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
That's why, Germany remains alone in its decision to resign from the nuclear energy.
This is not the case either of Belgium, which his submits to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or of Switzerland, which only has to construct for an object head offices of last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for quoting some examples, go forward with determination with its projects.
The United States, from his part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, recapturing the construction of a head office interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on the renewable energies, presents himself sometimes as an example, the reality goes against such a speech.
The election of Berlin is going to suppose an increase of the price of the electricity, a major energy dependence for the increased need for imported gas, in particular of Russia, an increase of the emission of CO2 for the coal and gas head offices construction.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be evident.
It must be pondered on the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, of which it obtains 30 % of its electricity, also is one of the big users of coal and of gas due to the intermittence of the wind; for this reason, its emission of CO2 and price of its electricity are, respectively, 65 % and 50 % higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the steadfastness of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an invoice of electricity 40 % superior to that of the French hearths.
While in an encompassed economy the cost of the energy constitutes a key factor of the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity of Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction of the nuclear energy would suppose a strong increase of the price of the electricity, what would reduce realism to the wonderful declarations on the restructuring of industry of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
It is a question of a price that the majority of the French refuses to pay and, in fact, they do not show opposition for beginning to this type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let's remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to construct an industrial sector with 125.000 positions of governing work and 410.000 indirect work places.
Extensively faced to the exportation, it includes a galaxy of pymes specializing on the international markets and that can create jobs not deslocalizables.
If France was deciding to leave the nuclear energy, there would suppose the sacrifice of big part of this SME and the loss of 6.000 million euros per year in French exports of equipment and nuclear services.
What electrician would entrust an EPR designed to work sixty years, when the destruction of its manufacturer is foreseen?
To solve the equation of the nuclear energy, it is necessary to admit that there does not exist a miraculous source of production of electricity, as a diabolical source does not exist either.
The development on the part of solutions Areva with low emission of CO2, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary character of the energy sources.
In case of the nuclear energy, it turns out to be essential to maintain the maximum safety level.
In France, we have a safety Authority that exercises a strict and transparent control both on the existing head offices and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with the safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, took place in a few normal operative conditions; it provoked consequences neither for the persons nor for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident owed to the design of the reactor and to a few inexcusable human mistakes.
In Fukushima, some persons seem to forget that the accident owed to two natural disasters of a scope without precedents, who provoked the death of tens thousands of persons.
The nuclear sector will learn of this accident, as it did it of two previous ones.
Thanks to these progresses and a cooperation between the safety authorities, and the operators and French and German builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting to such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electrical actors who want to construct a head office, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a big gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave free route to them to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It turns out to be indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to stop that the emotion, the dogmas and the maneuvers partisans were dominating such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
The immigration: a load or an opportunity for the economy?
The politics of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized setting off from diverse points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services submitted to the politics of numbers, the compatibility of this politics with the autoproclaimed statute of "country of the human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of the foreign students the one that has jumped the holders, with the Minister of Internal Affairs (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign, working talents not bartenders".
Nevertheless, rarely it is analyzed from the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this topic, there is enough consensus between the left and the right.
In case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation declaring in 1976 that "900.000 unemployed men should not be a problem for a country that is provided with nearly two million immigrant workpeople", while in the left, Michel Rocard fixed the tone telling that France "cannot take charge of the whole misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the grade of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right were sharing the fear of the invasion of the national territory for a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, it is considered that the immigrants are a load for the French economy and the society.
The only difference is in the grade of generosity with which they act with regard to the immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande limits himself to including banalities, indicating that the codevelopment will allow to solve the "problem of the migration".
This idea of the immigration like a load, a problem, perhaps turns out to be profitable electorally, but economically it goes out very expensive.
As there point out the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that he sums the most recent knowledge up on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May, 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp)., a wide consensus exists between the specialists on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth, the wages and the employment in the countries that immigrants receive.
The limitation of the immigration debilitates the growth and harms to the employment.
The fears related to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea of that these can replace the national workpeople, in particular the slightly qualified ones, pressing so that its wages diminish.
But the experience demonstrates that, in fact, the immigrants are rather complementary that substitutes of the national workpeople and they exercise principally professions in sectors with absence of employment.
The slightly qualified immigrants are employed at sectors that do not attract workpeople national and most qualified in dynamic sectors where the formation does not satisfy the personnel demand.
A positive effect on the wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties of working in a country that it has lacking in anesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants provokes that the arrival of the above mentioned influences positively the wages and the employment of the nationals.
Bearing in mind the previous thing, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 % of the migratory flows supposes an increase of the long-term real wages of between 0,6 and 0,9 %.
And, without bearing in mind the fact that the diversity that the immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economic growth (there exists a big proportion of naturalized American Nobel Prizes and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo was founded by immigrants).
The immigrants also are clear taxpayers to the social systems, since they contribute of average a 1 % of the entire budget in the European countries.
The International organization of the Work calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who comes with an age of 30 years will realize a clear contribution (income less expenses) for 150.000 euros to the public average budgets during all its life.
At the beginning of its order, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to look for the points of growth that he was lacking "with the teeth".
The above mentioned teeth, which dissuaded the immigrants, had exactly the inverse effect.
Europa inventó la democracia, solo le falta pensar en una democracia euroguisante
The democracy is a beautiful good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember it since, although it was invented in Athens it does more than two thousand years, throughout the XXth century he has suffered the tragedies of the World war, totalitarismos, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some of them perhaps believed that, so that the democracy was triumphing definitely over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in a way as direct as possible.
We know, from Napoleón "The child", that it was a question of something thought-out.
The universal suffrage, although it is a question of a condition necessary for the democracy, is not sufficient himself and even it can turn into a "instrument of oppression", as was saying formerly the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, the democracy needs much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis through that we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is on the point of turning into a political and democratic crisis.
The recantation of the real - false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sensation of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
One must be reflected on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle at present have moved and that, in many cases, the republican soldiers do not advance already in the good sense.
We will not go out gaining if we demand a succession of national referenda, organized according to the needs and of untidy form.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a high place to the gap of the nationalistic hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to extract blows of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, calm and continuous, of the options and the democracy, this time to European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, you would not be able to finish where the list), because only there is a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The totality of Europe is the one that submits to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of qualification, that the one that endures its powerlessness and its absence of solidarity.
It is the set of Europe the one that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We worry for the sovereignty transference to Europe, but it is the whole Europe the one that loses slowly the sovereignty and, with her, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that the popular sovereignty recovers the rudder of the European project.
Because only together the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of its debts, to be liberated of the markets and to prepare its future by means of the investments.
The exit of the crisis will need decisions to European scale that will not be able to take without an entire democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
After having fought for the long time against this proposal of the Socialists and of Jacques Delors, everybody asks at present for an European economic gobernanza.
That this way is.
But to think about her without a major political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and it would take us to a new deadlock.
We must assume a new stage of the European construction.
To construct the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be sufficient.
This lesson keeps on being applicable.
We must construct an Europe more integrated from the economic point of view.
it will be possible only to manage constructing a more democratic Europe in the political plane, a real European popular sovereignty.
To construct Europe, let's do Europeans.
The cards with chip "without contact" are generalized
The world lounge of the cards of chip begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, close to Paris, with an optimistic ambience.
In fact, the year 2011 should finish with an increase of 11 % in the world sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with cards SIM, etc.), with a whole of 6.000 million units, according to calculations of the office Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is that of the technology without contact, which allows to pay the transport together or the buys simply bringing the card over to a reader.
This year 460 million cards will sell in the whole world with chip without contact: 320 millions more than the previous year!
Its quota should keep on increasing in 2012 (580 million units are foreseen) and represent close to 10 % of the world market of the cards with chip (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which takes a lot of time left behind with regard to the region of Asia - Pacific Ocean, is gaining area in the sector of the payment without contact.
About 26 million bank cards Visa have already this function, which is accepted in 75.000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400.000 cards are using Visa without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has expressed this year 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To put the top march, nevertheless, it is necessary that the banks put them at the disposal of its clients.
"There are two big French establishments that have promised to spread systematically in the future, between its clients, bank cards provided with the system without contact", announces Gérard Nébouy, director-general of Visa Europe France.
The banks prove the payment by mobile phone
But only it constitutes the first stage towards the way of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there exist few devices equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication), indispensable to realize the deals.
"They are falling behind".
"But it should experience finally a real heyday the next year".
"We foresee that they will sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 in the whole world", tells Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front part.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the throwing of a test between December and next June in Caen.
There will be equipped the iPhone of about 200 clients and collaborators with a case that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société générale also has affirmed yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that he allows to its clients to pay without contact across its mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the increase
Paris worries for the ties between The Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The ties between the terrorist group Al The Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it was suspected for time, have been confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian Vice-minister of Foreign affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even affirmed that Algiers "already has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the reports of the services of intelligence demonstrate that they are cooperating", he told, without contributing any more details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the sequestration of two French in Níger last January would have resumed the footbridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey for persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory they died on the following day together with several of its kidnappers during an operation thrown by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the realized calls indicates towards several speakers based on Mali, Níger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers received especially the interest of the investigators: one leads a Nigerian that cradle of Boko Haram remained for the long time in Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, and other to a man who, supposedly, is near to Aqmi and to sect.
"It is a question of a progress, but undoubtedly we must wait to possess more formal tests before speaking about operative cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We know for years that the sect enjoys financial support and exterior intellectual and that every time it is more active", affirms Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
The latter months, the above mentioned "supports" had turned out to be more and more clear in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in its operative ways, which now imply the kamikazes' use or more and more complex explosive devices and of the same style as the used ones by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, is pressing since then Abuya so that it bears in mind the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, de facto, they take time considering the group to be a community of illuminated little worthy of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri concerning a mosque, a school and to the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (that it means, in hausa, "the western education is a sin"), incites to the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Moslem north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living through a rapid success.
It is politicized and demands a strict respect of the sharia, while its militants throw themselves to the struggle against the impious central government.
The above mentioned are faced first of all to the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were especially active and the attacks multiplied against the police stations.
The Abuya reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 dead persons registered.
Mohammed Yusuf arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect radicaliza and it leaves its fiefs of the north.
The past Christmastime, it claims an offense that it causes 80 dead persons in Jos and, later, other in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram attacks again against Abuya, in particular against the headquarters protected from the police, with a suicidal attack, the first one of this type.
In August, the local head office of the United Nations turns into its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which it would include from Mauritania up to Somalia happening for Nigeria, worries all the specialists of the safety.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Níger and that the Somali ones of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram arises like a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with the President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned him against Boko Haram and has affirmed that it was ready "to share all the information".
The world according to the republican candidates for the Presidency
As regards China, with Iran and with the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simple-mindedness and lacking in knowledge.
An America debilitated by the crisis: can it manage a complex world with simple ideas or, even, simplistic?
Listening to the republican candidates for the presidential ones, the electorate might think that this way it is.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other candidates every time do more thunderous declarations and short cuts on the subject of foreign politics, traditionally a strong point of the republicans.
The mottoes spread, often unbased, on China, Iran, the help to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the career towards the designation for "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese before the OMC and to denounce them "for manipulation of its currency", a key topic in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector towards Asia.
It does not matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he affirmed.
Jon Huntsman, ancient Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who possesses a sophisticated vision of the foreign policy, almost suffocates before an attitude that "crushes" the emotions.
He has asked for a firm, but constructive dialogue, with Peking (the current position of Obama).
Pero Huntsman, who remains suspended in the depths of the opinion polls, keeps on being unaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney also has promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions do not manage to interrupt its nuclear program.
"If I go out elected, I will detain Iran", it boasted.
"If Obama goes out re-elected, they will have the bomb".
It promised to increase also the military help to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with its obligations as regards this associate.
The businessman Herman Cain, the best classified second candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, it was urging to resist to the Chinese military threat because Peking "tries to develop nuclear capacity", seemingly ignoring the fact that China has already the military atom from 1964.
The Governor tejano Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that for his part, it is ready to open the American army in Mexico to fight against the cárteles of the drug.
The resource to the torture against the supposed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also it is praised by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that it gained the Cold War.
They remember that proper Obama was a fan and that the piston had to slacken on the subject of struggle against the terrorism.
They insist, with good reason, on the defeat of its ingenuous dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of the "boys" of Iraq and on its distortions on Libya, and label it of dweeb.
But the attacks do not turn out to be simple to them.
The population judges in a rather positive way the balance of national security of Obama, who finished with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts the military interventions that generate a subsidence.
And, arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct economically America to resuscitate its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, new door of entry of the Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, which communicates straight western Europe with Russia spending for the bottom of the sea Baltic, has already put itself in service.
It must give gas to satisfy the needs for thirty million hearths.
Gazprom, the Russian giant of the gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with big pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and of Government, informed on the banks of the Baltic, between the music of the band and a delicate buffet, in the opening of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates straight, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime minister François Fillon and its counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the frill of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the network of western Europe.
With this new gas pipeline, there will come every year 27,5 million additional cubic meters of Russian gas to western Europe across the first one it had of 1.224 km that communicate the region of Saint Petersburg with Land de Mecklemburgo-Pomerania.
The second pipe should end at the end of 2012 that will allow to give a whole of 55.000 million cubic meters of gas, that is to say, sufficiently to cover the whole French consumption.
Also, already one speaks about the possibility of constructing a third pipe for the same trip.
For Gazprom, the ending on time of this enormous work presents victory airs.
Poland and the Baltic countries had been opposed firmly to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream is going to allow to give gas straight Germany, avoiding the terrestrial course for third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose something of its power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence in Russia threatening her to close the access to the markets of western Europe.
In the icy point of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a German - Soviet "new agreement", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
Namely if the topic is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained a major supply safety.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy, since the project has generated a breach between the Europeans of this one and of the west.
Russia has been able, in only five years, to make triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, big western countries consuming gas and with a few more and more limited reservations.
"This gas pipeline constitutes a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that joins us of organic form", confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating until point the big contracts of the sector of the gas are so political as economic.
All this explains the wide smiles in the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, in the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline also supposes a technical achievement.
The submarine pipe is made of steel covered with cement to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It rests at the bottom of the sea, to an average 200 m deep.
To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields that date back to the Second World war.
"It was necessary to withdraw or to destroy a hundred of them, for precaution", points out Jens Müller, spokesman of the society Nord Stream.
Also, it turned out to be necessary to carry to extremes the protection measurements of the fauna and the flora.
The pipe is a long snake of metal that weighs like 242 towers Eiffel and is not interrupted in all its length: not neither for valves, nor for stations of maintenance.
A control platform was foreseen in the waters of Sweden, but the persons in charge of the project resigned the same one on having seen that the Swedishes were not very ready to allow a Russian state society to settle of permanent form in the sea opposite to its coasts.
"In case of breakdown, we will interrupt the step of the gas in less than one minute", adds Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas of the gas pipeline will be liberated, therefore, to the ambience.
But the builders consider little to be probable that should produce an escape to himself, since they have foreseen junctions that, according to the forecasts, will have an escape every 100.000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by means of a submarine robot dragged by a ship, which realizes exterior examinations, as well as by means of a device that circulates along the interior of the gas pipeline.
With the form of a cigar, it interferes inside the pipe, which possesses an one meter diameter, and moves with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full time of trip to a three meters speed per second, it gives precise information on possible distortions of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without need of any type of repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, to the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined its forces to be able to carry out this project.
The leading corporation is a Gazprom, which 51 % of the shares possesses.
To her, there joined the Germans E.ON and BASF (15,5 % each one), as well as the Dutchwoman Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9 % each one).
These five societies have created a common company, called Nord Stream, manager of constructing and exploiting the gas pipeline.
It has its head office in Zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition turns out to be especially favorable.
Later, Gazprom rented to the above mentioned society, during a renewable term of twenty-five years, the totality of the capacities of gas transport.
"He will pay away from Gazprom for the entire capacity, independently of the gas quantity that really is transported", adds Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has taken I finish in 30 % with the contribution of the shareholders and in 70 % by means of bank loans.
The entire cost of the work should reach 7.400 million euros for two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 millions.
But the minority shareholders are sure that they will not overcome its investment, since Gazprom assumes himself the risk of the expenses.
The gas pipeline emerges of the Baltic in Lubmin, on a planted sandy pines coast.
A few valves, with 4,5 meters high, form the door of exit of the gas.
There exist a few sensors that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas at the arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
From the last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
To entire capacity, there will be three millions per hour and in 2012, six millions.
Moleskine, a notebook of mark.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return to the people the taste for the writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in view of a sail.
The notebook Moleskine recognizes after itself easily, with its black rectangular pastas, its gum, its sheets of broken white color, like aged in the time.
Nevertheless, the notebooks Moleskine with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Way Way, based on Milan, decided in that moment to throw to the market a notebook of notes of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time counsel of the company, took charge of the throwing of the new product.
The notebook is inspired in an ancient production skill, the thick chile sauce skin (skin of mole), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, between other things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook was much valued by the writers and the travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the XXth century", tells Maria Sebregondi, who since then turned into person in charge of the mark in Way Way.
And it reached the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased in 26 %, up to reaching a volume of 12,7 million sold units.
Far there has stayed the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3.000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It turns out to be difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notes notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
As Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, of open spirit and cults.
The Italian small enterprise, which was provided with twelve workers in its beginnings, now possesses close to 100 and, from 2008, it has two offices: one in Milan and other one in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac up to the small commerce of the center of the cities, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted ourselves to the times and to the need to write, in spite of the heyday of the e-mails", tells Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes of the hand with the Moleskine development: recently, the mark has thrown the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, it threw also a notebook with lids of leopard, owing to the Film festival of Locarno.
Making use of its success and cultural aura is, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: purses, agendas, pens, cases of computer... The mark includes a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Way Way was acquired by the investment fund Cardinal SG Europe, at present Cardinal Syntegra, writing to him this way a new page in the Moleskine history.
Why does the valuation of unemployment of the disabled workpeople keep on being so high?
About 19 % of the disabled persons is looking for an employment.
XV Week for the employment of the disabled ones starts today.
In spite of a decisive public politics, applied from 2005, the unemployment valuation between the disabled persons duplicates the average valuation: 19 %, opposite to 9 % for the set of the population.
Discouraging?
"No", affirms Éric Blanchet, director-general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled ones.
"The progresses reached for fifteen years are considerable.
"Then, the unemployment valuation was not two times but three times higher than the average.
"Nevertheless, very much still stays for doing".
It is necessary to mention that the disabled unemployed men keep on facing numerous obstacles to gain access to the employment.
They usually have a more advanced age: 37 % has more than 50 years (17 % of average).
They possess a slightly high qualification level: 80 % has not finished the baccalaureate and, of 2,3 million students in the higher education, only 10.000 are disabled.
Finally, the unemployment of long duration is much extended between them: 53 % for the disabled ones, opposite to 38 % of average.
Namely there exist numerous questions that make difficult especially the return to the labor world and that "they constitute the core of the problem", points out Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the companies to hire disabled workpeople.
These are the objective obstacles.
Also, there exist those that are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly.
A study realized in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité was pointing out that the polled directors have "a knowledge level on the disabilities under", with a "excessive representation of the persons in wheelchair, deficient physicists or intellectuals".
The result: the private enterprises with more than 20 workers are very far from the target to hire 6 % of disabled workpeople, target that was fixed in a law of... 1987.
According to the last available numbers, which date of 2008, they reach a relation of 2,6 %.
"Now we reach concerning 3 %", points out Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the organism entrusted to collect the contributions of the companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "submitted to this contribution", as the paid out quantities, they have diminished between 2007 and 2011, spending from 59.000 to 46.000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which was increasing the contributions, has generated a big pressure for the companies", tells Pierre Blanc.
"But this progress also reflects a real campaign to raise public awareness, in particular between the big groups".
According to the Department of Labour, only 59 % of the societies who possess between 20 and 49 workers account with disabled personnel in its staff, opposite to 82 % of the companies of between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A happiness"
On the verge of facing the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard y Georges Leekens they do not conceal the pleasure that this friendly game generates to them.
We will not dare to say that connivance was evident between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sat one along with other, in the dais of the auditorium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really they have done the peaces.
Five months after the gesture of rancor of its forward against Turkey, the Belgian coach has only praises for him.
"I was glad very much for Eden, for its progresses and because it is Belgian".
"I want to advance", answers him the Lille forward.
As for the contrast between its presentations in its team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has justified itself.
"In Lille, I am the whole year, which is not applied to Belgium.
"I have to be located".
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, bearing in mind it is divided against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis, finally, to "shine".
Without forgetting the "pleasure".
Ride cheering the Bleus up since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been its fan", he affirms.
Undoubtedly, that is going to reinforce especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because it will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rummy)", he remembers.
"We have just faced not long ago.
"To play against them is always a happiness."
Engañe sencillez, Leekens ah hecho por su parte referencia "orgullo" Al-.
"Pride" for disputing "a party of gala".
"Pride" also for verifying, like "neighbor", that France "is a team of very high level again", nearly one year after the Knysna traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable work", he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be present at the next European competition, the technician would be pleased of being able to share plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing", he emphasized.
"We are constructing something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"They will be able to see it in the next parties". Included the party against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces a big optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), that will be celebrated on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the going party, both teams were lacking realism.
"When they pass these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country".
Paulo Bento ya se ve en Polonia y en Ucrania.
It does not have any doubt; the Selecçao, which directs from September, 2010, is going to become qualified for the Euroglass of 2012.
Really, only 90 minutes separate Portugal of the happiness.
But there is a party to be played and a rival, Bosnia, which to defeat.
Bearing in mind the party of going (0-0), on Friday in the Zenica hell, it seems clear that the thing is not determined.
Portugal dominated the party during more than one hour, yes, but it could not score the valuable goal that had given him the calmness.
"It is a good result, but simultaneously it bears a risk, since we have not marked out of house".
But at home, in the luminous Stadium of the Light of Lisbon, the Portugueses are sure that they will happen, before a public who should be equal of ardent, enclosed if it turns out to be clear that the party "is very even", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope that the party should be very even, but we are sure completely that we can take the front part", the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer declared.
"We keep on having 50 % of possibilities of taking part in the Euroglass 2012", there is, nevertheless, played down the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The Friday tie in Bosnia forces the Portugueses to mark and to win.
A tie might come to the Bosnians, although also they have need to mark.
"It is a good result, but simultaneously it bears a risk, since we have not marked out of house", he is sorry about Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that possesses a technical high quality and that has players with an individual high quality", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portugueses they will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians "not to leave to them time to be thought".
A good idea, whenever, this time, it is realistic.
