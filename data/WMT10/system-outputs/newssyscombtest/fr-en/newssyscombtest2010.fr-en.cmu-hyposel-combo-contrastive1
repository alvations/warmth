The lack of snow in mountain bothers hoteliers
The tracks were not a problem that operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find rooms free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of hits on our site.
Internet users travel offers, asking prices, but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call us, they call immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too reluctant to book.
If we give priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation only then, we can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindler propose for the moment that stays of a week for the New year.
I think they will try one more time to place, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The agency of tourism Ingtours of Vrchlabí also proposes more beds free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas interests us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few visits Christmas last minute cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert."
The agency Vrchlabí tourism may also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The 14 days of February go equally well, the remaining winter stays are moderately.
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
People expect it to get to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont to Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We have few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of Polish January and February sells well too, "said Karel rada, director of the best hotel in pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking of Jánské Lázně is also full to Eighty percent during the period of the New year.
On the contrary, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel Jánské Lázně.
This year, we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already 60% occupancy at the moment.
February is a little more low at the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše builds certainly still indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there is rain, they should be neigeuses mountain.
But subsequently, the time should warm, informed Jiří Jakubský Station of Hradec of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the painstaking effort with which Barack Obama, Chairman of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which it considered itself simple.
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had isneeded carbon paper since the iraq scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression "as in Iraq, it has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech:" a new way forward "
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of bush, who came out of the recommendations of commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success that newspapers currently do not speak at all of iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of bush, however, objectively speaking, it has left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It is the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the operation in afghanistan, general Stanley mccristal, which has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had defrauded the General 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to stamp out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it had about 10,000.
This brings the most problems throughout the Obama strategy appears to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process by three years. the doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands in the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will the smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is extremely complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick to act", which is the basic aim of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy Obama makes perplexed by his determination.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and outside the reality can be confident that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war to their "quick return to the house" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will consider the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
The European political know or do not want to explain to their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions have no effect on the iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that it is working on a new strategy, if it proves to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive bonuses in cash
Employees senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive shares instead of money, that they will not sell for five years.
The actions can be withdrawn to leaders in case they would take too many risks.
According to reuters, Goldman Sachs is and leading the effort to link the rewards with long-term performance on Wall street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that we must take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the company JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of the premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it intends to spend a single fee of 50 per cent bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.

The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited to the castle
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the public finance crisis.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss its Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of $163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left on money transfers and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social democrats that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of fischer had been trained by agreement between the ods, the ČSSD and the Green party.
Critics say that the budget, as it was voted by members, removes the package of saving measures passed by the Government of Fischer and according to stem the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" disability irréfrénable_OOV "of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a broader consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a Cabinet official supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of "drastic" verdicts.
The head of the ČSSD Jiri Paroubek reacted against Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering, and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Wednesday, the ČSSD described as a success the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.

The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russian tested a rocket
There has been a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has yet been a failure and the type "bulava missile" which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir putin.
His presence repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava has not disappeared, or it is damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile which do not steal"
A missile that is not
This 13th test took place at the beginning normally.
It is only at the end of the flight that there was further damage on the apparatus.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" has disappeared from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the has likely been a bulava "flawed.
The rest, the Norwegians have not doubted a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk absolutely failure.
The first two floors of the rocket have resisted and damage was confined to the third.
In previous cases, the engines have been failures on the first floor.
Even if no test launches went smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent fills the general optimism and they say is always a day "Bulava'fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant in Noiovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency monday strike.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The Directorate is yet to reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus CZK 400 employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be allocated afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their Christmas and new year Aindiqué.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and most warm in the comments and the claims of the unions as employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions are cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the direction of the car factory and trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state to strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signing of a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees started spontaneously on strike because of incessant overtime.
They were protesting against the poor conditions of pay and so-called bizutages.
Management has defended with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the imperatives of production cars.
At the announcement of the strike monday, unions have also requested that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for them.
The car plant Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It has manufactured approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "hard-working people"
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the substance improved is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS.
Nevertheless, we can prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
Their consumption, however, involves a series of side effects.
Over the repression of this proliferation for the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way in a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called Metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used until now and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the proteins of the virus.
The Metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the Cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech republic.
In their works published in the scientific Journal Journal of Medicinal chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, but it has not weakened on resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are some interesting combinations to examine more to move towards the development of effective drugs against hiv, "says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology from the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics institute of the Academy of sciences.
Dispute around The budget. The ODS is Fischer, who defends
The President of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister has described the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet official supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party did not clearly.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his post with the assistance of the Parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as what an amended budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Disappointment and
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister after its passage in government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the Čssd, which have imposed changes to the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, said in a statement from the United states.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation to fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the house."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it will be on the agenda when I will dedicate, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin barták, elected government by the democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the prime minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the democratic Members of the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered accusations from the president of the Party in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
The czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and instead would increase other.
The total coverage of transport fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rates and reduced fare.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region which will have more routes to the capital, the Railways will add a rowing.
On the contrary, an Express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transportation for the region of Hradec Králové of eight percent in total, Prague and its environs can increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the most sweeping changes, we can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad labem.
It is for the fifteenth line of commuter system, including the opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines distant to the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will leave by intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up in Bratislava on 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kronor.
The express trains are ordered and paid by The department of transportation and The Railways will next year in all four billion kronor to visible, The same amount as this year. The regional trains are controlled by The regions who will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that The state will participate to The tune of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and the Internet eLiška.
For travellers without a map of reduction, the price of ČD Net increase of 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška newly will depend on the journey, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region to choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.

The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in the united states in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: neporažený), and narrae part of the life of the former South African president Nelson mandela.
The role of fighting against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
For its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since it is presented at a time when one hand South Africa is in full preparations for the football World cup, and secondly because the media are disturbed by disturbing news about the increase of racial conflicts and discrimination of the black majority in power.
According to the agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met personally with Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - to recover his energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South africa, but it is individual, he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room who gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between dressed swimwear national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World cup, that South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been a lengthy ovation it fourteen years ago mainly white audience and was recognized by the white populations.
Hope that the football championship will succeed to unite people again in a single nation, said the rugby player Chester williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the South African tense situation will improve.
The white South africans, however, are sceptical as recently said in an interview for LN Christopher dawson, rugby fan who has fled to britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.

The damage is estimated at tens of millions of kronor, the exact figure will be known once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed will be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, the society Čeps has experienced anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
The power supplies were not interrupted, said the spokesman for the Society for the north Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, government and industry has not been influenced by the fire station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory sets of transmission and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.

Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today for defamation complaint against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal good soldier Švejk ’ of the region of south moravia, against Radko Martínka of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have yet to sign long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three have attacked us and say that is the fine mouths, while it has only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways which were signed last week.
Therefore we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura in Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region has taken in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the filing of the complaint of Mr. Jančura represents the result of its media spectacle that provides free publicity for his company and his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, said
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement which will include the steps unfavourable regions.
He said to Radiožurnál that it will stop the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech Railways operate rail links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing an invitation to tender.
According to jančura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is but I would not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal diseases will be free and optional
Vaccination against the pneumococcal reversed the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Critics already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal.
The pharmaceutical institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay for health insurance.
The experts are also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal free.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay yourself following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated children against pneumococcal.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 million kronor in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children require.
So far the state spends about 500,000 crowns per year for the vaccination of children.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the "package Janota."
The pneumococcal are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible mandatory vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria.
At an international conference in which our association participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that it must now follow said Kalovský.
But the ministry of health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We are absolutely not for the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledged that a vaccine based on the Volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said however Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children that is funded by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they would save and on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This is linked to the concerns of paediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors the receiving the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the amount of health insurance. "
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance them back.
According to estimates, pediatricians will individually invest nearly 40 000 sek per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the last book of the author, "why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), a study elegant and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in france, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and colleges that are now in France this queM. Bozen calls "Muslim" spaces for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite Guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises historic with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrow key values".
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The view the world's darkest
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice are melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing sail new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the north, the polar bear.
Knows the history and complicated political of the whale, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years who had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, caught as they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a show celebrates 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the area required an adult in the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopter and Inuit Indians in use Fusilsd' powerful assault to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of these two nations of the hunt that ice will stay longer.
In his New book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the Atmosphéristes nor oceanographers can accurately tell the speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped in the change of relief.
The surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr Anderson looking at the world extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressure by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.

The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class Angello robinson, 19, made a trip of seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other Marine who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If it was me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I just trying to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, in Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife karen, each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way to organize the commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (of Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the Cemetery of Arlington, around the pentagon, on the graves of the Cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enarkansas_OOV, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in shanksville, pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen hunt, 70, of westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
Although her husband is not buried at arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
All in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples were held by the hand, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on the graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, were silent on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the sour mood of the current wars filled the area.
People wept openly, others prayed and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others have commented to see small black and white information cards, stuck in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and had led eight hours to come to gather at the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget thanks to what we are free … my son has paid for it, she said.
"long after I have disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of "dangerous".
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and critical writing, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by Government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although new consumer goods and desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation which corresponds to a day of salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans who want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few US in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "says Gloria Berbena, press officer of from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity which, in any other open society, would be authorized -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called" new Castro, Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries are beginning to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an alleged organizing a conspiracy to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would help to dismantle a large network of recruiters of terrorists scouring the Internet looking for young men radicalized.
Investigators have said that they were hunting a personality Insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah which invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services which had been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the Al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of northeastern become a shelter of terrorism.
They have been as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and they are still trying to obtain the necessary permissions for entry into the camps of al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for infiltrate men in the al-Qaeda network.
The organization recruiters play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and propagandaire of their value.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the Foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept as the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen request an "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on the part of negotiators working in the Palace of Congress Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25 000 according to police estimates.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little has happened during discussions on The climate sponsored by The United nations, thousands of activists marched through The city, deploying banners in English saying there is no planet B "and one in spanish, saying" The Earth said that it has enough ".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, peru, has opened his eyes on issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change that are already occurring. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to get the word out and to launch an appeal to leaders around the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who requested anonymity because of his involvement in the discussions on the climate, the activists who wore black masks and clothing, started several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few departments.
They launched near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su wei, representative of china for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in english "in fact, this is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal deep-seated differences between the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the last two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white, both local and national.
The results means of white children in Grade 4 (CM1) to WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The achievement gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only a point, from 245 to 244.
The result means white has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (CM1), when the first report NAEP District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of rhee, Brown said that the message of test results is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
But fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, schoolchildren classes of elementary cycle end and beginning of college that had not incorporated the basics of Reading earlier in their schooling and are quite far behind with their peers.
Every day, the Mathematics curriculum, for Kindergarten classes (Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, such that they have been put in place in the District by the former responsible Clifford janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students to lower level than the class, said rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with fewer good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle rhee, said Bruce fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the results of tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political repercussions that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other superintendent of schools, it is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhoods schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, be assured that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the achievement gap is the duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of washington, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" for an increase in the next contract.
To make higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, descended and carved a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and rolling lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super That's where I will study! "exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide headed towards the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi, really? "She says pensive, when he said the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was The seventh that visited The children during their journey of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated The message: The question is not whether you go to University:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the US without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers who study the claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program which funded the visit of universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize programmes of preparation for the university which began when students from low income families are in middle school (College) and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the US Department of education.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with the foreign Oil companies suggest that Oil companies from china, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the Oil industry of iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had set an auction has lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of Asian and European companies that pave the way, "said Ruba husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil forum, a site of information on the internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, corroborated by massive bombings coordinated, tuesday, and the political instability that american troops withdraw have slowed the american oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and brought their technical advice, came away empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit auctions have made offers that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of Al-Qaida, this week, said Friday the US authorities of counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the town of Miran shah, in the province of North waziristan, according to us sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was struck, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone of Miran shah.
The representatives of the authority have said that local activists suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely shredded".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American counterterrorism officials provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organisers, military officials who ran Al Qaeda terrorist operations of the group out of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies in the world, "said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the instructions strategic leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six transactions per month to two, according to the figures given by the Long War journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group.
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN special envoy in afghanistan, Kai eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in march, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United nations.
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported this increase but he expressed concern about the US timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the us and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in afghanistan.
The military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but that it would respect the commitment he had made to his family, in march, will spend two years in kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen italo-swiss recently chaired a un mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the un peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of éléctions."
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in afghanistan, saying that it would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of hiring UN hampered her ability to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since may, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One of the things that I weighs most, is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has said that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a "package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly on these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring Agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (iaea).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, develop a confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be remote attempts agree - in part, say the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the stiffening of the Iran faced with some of the proposals of the international community for which they had given their agreement in early october, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered important, in terms of additional sanctions against the iranians, said gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "sanctions".
In a statement Thursday in New york, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said that she agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term ".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late friday, met in the morning, the iraqi Prime Minister, nouri al-maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish to derencontrer display of troops to kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm The anxiety of The Kurds on The withdrawal pending. The American authorities have cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of The Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster of propaganda preaching, "mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "one more baby, this is a tomb in more".
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in china, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a crisis of the population threat the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing Population and to prevent a shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however, that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
Written in the constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights denounced the abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of towns, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already children unique -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans.
Qiao xiaochun_OOV, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research), at Peking university, said that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encourage families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only around 165 thousand -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of Family Planning in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, said that they loved to have two children and they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we flew the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human resources manager, said she wanted only a single child because it was a itself. "we were the centre of the family and used that everyone cares."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which restrict the birth rate, he says, it must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents fight in the first time China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, he says.
Even one child asks a lot of time his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of his social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You must change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations has plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the un -- characterized so far by assignments disorganized and mutual recriminations -- is back under the spotlight friday because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized Nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, so that he has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a Special Working Group of the United Nations, the text does not say how the rich countries would give poor to withstand global warming, and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues, including how the developed economies and the emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, àWashington Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of 180 pages to focus on what the Secretary-General has described executive on the UN climate change, Yvo de boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduced by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also re-launched negotiations, friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd stern, the US Representative to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also lamented that the text is not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outsiders.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Foreign affairs, He yafei_OOV has said that the US chief negotiator, was "common sense", was either "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the US would not help financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major World powers involved, defects emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial World and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States querellant on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also advise on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation international.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to press for a treaty requiring legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur runge-metzger, Head of unit climate of the European commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the political process complete," in part by what they are now unified and they require to emerging economies such as China and india, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be reviewed during the course of the next week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and exit the Palais des congres every day -- activists of guitar players present nocturnal performances mocking countries which they felt betrayed and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all key Ministers are here and not later than wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in copenhagen.
We are entering the court major, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the Syndrome Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle when entering the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train the country will reach 225 km / h, whereas it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, north and Scotland to london.
The small holes lost become commuter cities successful business travel times will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to train reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of dangers to the environment will hamper british high-speed lines.
According to The times, High Speed Two (hs2), a company established in January to achieve for The government a feasibility report, will make her paper to Lord Adonis on 30 december.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high-speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line in two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from the west of the Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another towards the Northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance' said a professional rail.
When it is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to travel an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km / H, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built by one.
The trains will be forced to drive out of high-speed lines on the existing track north of birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure the passage of the planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of £75,000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan duncan, the Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a orangerie that he built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "maintained", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, making a controlling spending. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer and more simple."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a lounge and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a véranda at home, describing in its plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours describe as a "porch for fun".
It was not asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of the privileges and standards of the Commons, on its loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271.406 of his property in London at home in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month for mortgage interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the borrowing of £75,000.
The standard interest rate variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 in may.
Mr Duncan lost his position as Head of the shadow cabinet in september, after a journalist under cover the supposedly filmed saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" M... E "
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could ask sacrément more, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, millionaire from his former post as an oil trader, has begun to explain its spending, in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of m Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved by the fees office then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
True, you all see the Advent calendar of Brighton

He said: "We want religion is closer to the people in a society Post-chrétienté.
"As a Church, why do we expect that people entering an old building strange? It seems to me that the Church should bring people together and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of Advent calendar the cabin of beach came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a place so creative and vibrant and we are trying to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger prison guards, actions
The prison guards' unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of year holidays bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
Fo-pénitentiaire (2 th kgeu supervisors) has asked the personnel who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning before the prisons and the "block", to "denounce the theft of their due."
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in different prisons for strong mobilization", saying "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of' overtime, bonuses for night, Sundays and holidays "in October.
And the first Union of supervisors, the prison autonomous Federal Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to make up the discontent and anger".
The Department of Corrections and the Department of Justice explain that the extra hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to unions of their supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writing the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the leadership of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation wrong assessment of the number of overtime does not happen in the future, "Mrs alliot-marie.
The pay in December will be lean, except for the personal direction the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good backs."
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the union interregional FO in marseilles, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings".
The staff will not work on Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take money to staff, believes the CGT-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some less worse than others.
But in any case it is not, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama said offer "more" than those it receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas in a family in the White House, gave the "Papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule of gifts: "I give things more chouettes than I am receiving".
In the framework of a special program to be broadcast Sunday on ABC tonight, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious remains.
Even bo, the small companion to four legs of the family will.
The father christmas also loves Bo, said Michelle obama, stating that the dog would "of course" a gift, according to excerpts of the show broadcast in advance.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said Friday his son David upon arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he should go to the bedside of his father, hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday its exit from the plane that led to Paris shortly after 1300 local time (2100 GMT).
The son of singer, air relaxed, assured that he would make "very quickly" to the hospital Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection after the operation for a discal hernia in Paris on November 26.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a reason for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and administer its treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia operation discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles where is their daughter Jade, to attend a school, found a photographer of AFP.
The head of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the hospital in la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinic Internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "party much too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, as I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic community.
It had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Oxford where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor sulphurous reputation, repeatedly condemned by the court, in records in medical liability, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the Order of Doctors, was accused of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "not recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that the post-operative tests were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and not required the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been this summer, appears in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the New Centre to use its logo
The association udf, controlled by the MoDem party of françois bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the New centre, Hervé morin, on the acronym of the ex-communist giscardien, which is no longer use it on any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after having reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past the NC) which claims ownership of the mark to have been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let, is out of her silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and member, not to use the acronym and to transfer the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you were going to offer your political movement of + + the acronym udf, association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including françois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem and that Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow on your militant equipment and on the page of your site, the name of this movement, the + New Center +, the slogan + the UDF today, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this logo, the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the name of the UDF of any medium and (his) internet site".
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette "to convey the property of (the) marks its legitimate right".
If you were not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the udf, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they indicate that the UDF "is a political movement since 1978" and that mr Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the ump".
The New centre has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d' Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continues the bureau, "when he filed the mark", it was "more adherent of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
He criminally and fraudulently benefit from the absence of filing of the acronym UDF to conduct for his account.
This is in the process of becoming crime, Dénoncent-ils, before the strategy of NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for yourself to try to break the anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of the weakness of the 80-year-old to rob a part of his fortune.
The photographer 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on the 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fines.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of france, in which a mother and daughter are squabbling while taking the reins of the empire of cosmetics oréal.
But the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be waged collectively by three doctors.
The heir and a major shareholder in L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors named Friday to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying, especially if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in the state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will.
I'm going to talk, "said at the end of the hearing, counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For its part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, I Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, contracts of life insurance or tables.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as an old friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, arguments from lawyers have sometimes turned into a large family unpacking Friday.
Thus, counsel Liliane Bettencourt has reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre again suggested that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a juvenile judge has refused in recent days to allow its application to open a judicial procedure of protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has finally decided that it would decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial Revolution or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will be pointless...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, recalls the position of vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" defined above as it was once, to dictate to consumers of products devised by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, revolution marketing has presented the strategies of conquest of markets to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences populations return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the authoritarian management completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of concerns of the company as well as the client.
The relative opinion surveys
The investigation of domestic opinion – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
- first because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure in the end, after many detours, priority … what it has always done.
- Secondly, because the authoritarianism one of the pathologies of increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory Behavioriste, recently revived by the "Neuroscience" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro fr confirms she leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, to adopt a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clear as a means to achieve some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and submit their management of human resources in the area. "
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "just war" is right to praise Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday speech the day before in Oslo by Barack obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the us.
The Conservatives, who had the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for vice-president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, creative partner of the right wing of the Republican Party, the daily USA Today, adding personally addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, she said.
Mr obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of mr obama, Newt gingrich, said that the president had done in Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this quite historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed for The radio program" The Takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted a columnist for the Washington Post, Mr Obama made a "very American discourse."
In addition to appearing in "citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "reminding europeans" that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, "said mr gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, described the speech as "dull, spouted and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When envelope the war in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The press remained against the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, called his remarks "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", has ignited the daily californian.
Mr Obama "delivered the speech that he needed," said the New York times, "both dark and inspiring".
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of marathon talks, the road sector unions and employers' organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday evening at an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to supplies of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" of the agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the early morning friday, with the hope of sign quickly in late morning the text of the agreement.
And even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11 a.m. so that everyone to agree and 00 the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that he disrupt the christmas and new years," said Mr bussereau.
The text provides for a pay increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international).
In hourly rate, for, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but it is very far, said Patrice closed (FO).
This is going to give the order to our activists that there is no, no amount of supplies.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the senior salaries because of international competition."
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) has welcomed" a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (cgt) has raised "an acceptable compromise.
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau reiterated that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' has been the subject of a Government amendment to draft amending finance law for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same."
The signing of TLF allows the Agreement applies initially to the member companies to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," Mr bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool", because the eur 100 million "had already been promised the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of state for transport has obliged us to negotiate in the emergency, not the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to thwart turkey eaters the next eve, deplored the unostra_OOV.
For the school, the agreement risk "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger on their demand for premium.
Saturday and sunday, for this important weekend shopping before christmas, there will be no trains between 10 a.m. and p.m., with one train on two on the central portion (between Defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central portion.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP striving to serve the big stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east Greater Paris.
The stretch RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak hours, and almost no trains on off-peak hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there has been no congestion on the docks, is being organized.
And in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of school students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted "an hour and a half earlier, so be sure to arrive on time".
The station Saint-Lazare has not known of saturation, indicated the sncf, which had provided a framework of agents and police forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and sunday, which will review the results, deemed "meagre" by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate A specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what they want drivers, who are demanding a bonus, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP will even put its proposals in brackets premium, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the management "was not kaput to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is planned Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What has also told unions that the company "scoffed users of the weekend.
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the direction, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and independent.
The trade unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (unsa) to EUR 150 and EUR 30 variables (cgt, fo, cfdt, south, independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line the million daily passengers.
Drivers of RER, all in the second part of career, affect of 2,200 to 2,700 gross euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish Justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision fraught with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court said Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (dtp) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the president of the court Hasim kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to deliver the dissolution, said Mr kiliç, adding that 37 of party officials, including its president Ahmet türk and member armenia tugluk_OOV, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as Members without labels.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (pkk), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
The party, however, that there was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government has to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to shrink the support of Kurds in the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south-east anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast populated mainly by Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and stones, with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, Ed) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This resolves nothing, "said Minister of Energy Taner yildiz.
This decision is a sinking total of democratic openness launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "silicon valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, off-limits to visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" Soviet.
Important production sites and research into micro and Nanoelectronics are located.
As early as September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place des Sciences Mehr – with academic institutions and companies of the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There have been meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwartz head of section project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will depart at Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange
It is a scientific exchange.
But also of economic relations.
It will enable the companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Unlike the Russian scientific societies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of research institutes and companies Soviet famous.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The joint was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" for research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") gets its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
We cannot place high enough the magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21, it is more that the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of baden-württemberg, in a chaos despairing yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations head of line, with lines that ended in town, had a reputation at the time of the relics of the technique of transport in the 19th century which were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic as it once needed a lot of time to get the locomotives from front to rear.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – that is to do.
That is why the stations front line must disappear: in Frankfurt and munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of trains, which is about halfway on the major trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the head of the line no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with and Voiture-pilote at both ends.
It is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
The regional and communal prevailed.
The railway company is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of the largest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public company.
From the point of view this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that – if it believes the computer-generated graphics planners – will be very green.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for traffic to which we assigned - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods as transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, not suitable for freight trains.
The s21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will other junctions and congestion in the network.
The list of the Department of Transportation says 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley 180 miles.
Since 1987 this line is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project is a braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The Government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the aterrissage_OOV northwest to Frankfurt Airport would.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between March and shell in the morning, as envisaged by the government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in Cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to put pressure on the government representative for that Celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be; as a total failure to a word.
It is difficult to be allowed to keep its word, "said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP" We keep our promises ".
The Minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land Government tries to even the night flights using "Avocasserie and Roublardises".
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "rapid" first impression.
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its share on the prohibition of night flights is completely.
US banks repay the aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their ties vis-à-vis the State.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid under the rescue plan Tarp.
The chain of American television CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions are trying to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and the Regulation of higher charges.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities to investors who reported $19 billion of fresh money.
The remainder comes from the coffers of the bank are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money on financial markets to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The American bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, the CNBC citing banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they received.
Election
Finally it even faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding of the post of chief writer Nikolaus Brender by the Board of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting of ZDF was the big favorite.
The chain has not wished to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the steward of the ZDF Markus Schachter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of Administration to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this was rejected.
Only 7 Council members had expressed support for The continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against The dismissal by a vote of Brender represented a massive failure while predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU majority in the Council of Administration had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender to his position.
It is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a League against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had fallen under brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence on the zdf.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law that had intruded in the debate and who felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it nothing.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the science-policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Radio body of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first to the news magazine "heute-journal" (today).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (emission information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the then head of the editor.
After the disgrace of Brender, while it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch to governing Council, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt beck, said last week that the länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to ask the withdrawal of political figures who are members of committees overseeing the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the board in criticizing the Commission in its decision to sack Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the board of directors could elect without being suspects to place as a partisan politics.
In the representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Cleaning up university
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates to the conference of presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They particularly accordpour lighten the burden of reviews: a single review should help to close the study module.
In addition, the workload will be Reconsidée to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for the Bachelor and master.
At the regional level, there should be no regulation of a land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university presidents have repeatedly to mouth the buzzword: "étudiabilité."
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical meaning.
The accreditation council decided to significantly reduce the number of some reviews: "each module should normally be concluded by a single review," read in a document of 30 pages of future conditions for admission to graduate.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the accreditation council said that by significantly reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop the abuses, which significantly the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should also be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules as substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this smothering sensation that you feel sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will affect access to new graduate but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be re-certified "every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 of accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the Accreditation Council created by the Länder.
In october, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the regime of not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen educational guidance offices and the offices of reviews and the service of International Relations
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
As a result, there will be no more one consideration to complete his studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, more must be able to ensure the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the étudiabilité "of all university review.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticisms have been heard.
The Federal President of the student union Socialist indicated that it would like the organization of educational policy does not happen again in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and heads of universities.
At the latest after the strike, students as people concerned should be able to speak a little.
The future graduates of higher Education received the support of the President of the conference of presidents (HRK) Margret wintermantel_OOV: "the experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK working on a common reform project.
For the union of Education and Science (gew) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. it calls the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor degree to enroll in a cycle of master.
Andreas Keller steering committee member of the GEW also requested that the Länder provide students Bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins the poet Werner Söllner, in which he dealt with in snippets of sentences disturbing, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but has lost at the same time its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he was the chair very popular poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of the Forum of Literature of Hesse to the house of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He has done a lot of him in circles not literary last tuesday, at a conference in munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files securitate".
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers Germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informer for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
Tests began in 1971.
I am, "concludes söllner so someone who has not been able to resist auxessais intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (Im Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, Im Walter has played a role, the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Im Walter, who had intervened in his favour.
"It had been drawn from all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel has felt the need Moralde make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit, having read the 914 pages of his own case.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and may have guessed what real names were hiding last names of borrowing sorin, Voicu and walter.
Unlike Germany where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed in the past.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution Birthler was created to work to the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of files rather has dragged on since.
Since 2005 there is a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar which, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed in a very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately it had questioned only once.
The infamy of power to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many issues are associated with the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt.
Why now? which has been robbed? The prudent reaction of listeners, The admission of söllner, gives us hope that The result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta müller, who received the Nobel prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Turmoil in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was there, best from any right to a celebration of Christmas nice, on which the sportswear manufacturer had displayed its goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross Monta at midnight the quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just called, a plastic bag, Orange, the supplier.
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, was driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our peers could take the wheel himself – he had not been drinking alcohol and it was not drunk happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it should return to work.
Because it is now that it would start.
The words of switzerland that had to take three days earlier were clear: "we have reached the eighth final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal fight not to fall".
The "big job" lies ahead Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League.
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / return match 9 / 10. + 16. / 17. march) will be drawn at random the 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate among those who had brought luck, who had sent professionals in Stuttgart destabilized, unfailing motivation and pleasure to play.
I was to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" – Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais_OOV was more effects with the caregiver Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami khedira_OOV which, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh" and the working method of the new leader: "it is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart are in need of tenacity.
Just as gross, the players and the manager tightlipped about overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests romanians.
They had also won in Glasgow before they have had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet past cape.
That Heldt the day of his 40th birthday was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of the Guardian of Jens Lehmann did pick up just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others are not Jens, confounded Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the leadership of style and said that it had decided to change coach under pressure from fans.
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the matches he has been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" Heldt and announced the consequences for goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and combative sports would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "a large part in the success" Heldt and Lehmann in choir and even the man in the plastic bag.
World Championship heavyweights
Hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and Gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the version of the federation wbc.
The judges in the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The federation wbc announced that on the night of saturday, the champion of 38 years had won a victory to the unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defends with honour its title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately it has not passed the KB.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 fighting professionals, twice its defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat in the 24th.
In the arena of berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from its 2.02 metres, by the left.
Johnson, of 11 centimetres smaller, which before the duel had announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, and empéchant Klitschko to bring into play its far-right detrimental.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures firing very rarely the champion.
It is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
It insulta Klitschko dealing with "zombie" ugly "is not really capable".
During the weighing Friday, the champion has not been able to refrain from provoking Johnson fall sunglasses nose "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko imposed again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered its "wbc belt that he had previously abandoned without a struggle.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola us.
"I have just taken a blow in this fight and am in perfect form," said Klitschko to explain his rapid return to the ring.
His Rève is to try to bring in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who, with the great détroné Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko to take place in september.
It would appear that his promotion company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence of lying in the Case of Kunduz.
The SPD party and The Left Party (Die Linke) asked Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After examining the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information of the chain ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper pm).
This means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen truck, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of nato, 142 people were killed or injured in the us air strike which was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg klein, military commander of kunduz.
The greens, the SPD and the Left have asked Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (cdu), to decide as soon as possible before the federal parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party, Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say if the strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghan policy if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The chancellery has in any way influenced the interventions of the Army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, there were increasingly high to express doutesquant the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the department.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and some ministerial hidden embarrassing details.
In the entourage of two senior officials but it was suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
"the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, it has not answered
Saturday, the department declined comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the next Wednesday in order to bring light on the facts in question.
The worlds of fantasy
Some see awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality mingle.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms clouded, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has the reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to melt.
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, can be in various forms, in the best case it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos castaneda, the latter states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar process.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmitter brain - first and foremost the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine_OOV - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé_OOV; Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between the madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who composed".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into character in a comic book.
His body is in two dimensions to the colours.
The attraction has more power on him in the ceiling.
It is a blow.
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, the mouth bloodied, showing its teeth.
They continue, give the shots feet with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Thundering voice, nasty, howl, outgoing walls and radio.
It can no longer bear these voices who insult and humiliate.
Henning T. snatched two cables of its stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He mounted on a baffle and goes on the loop around the neck.
It is obvious.
The loop stands out.
That you used a lesson, shout the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum. 'care in a clinic and yourself! "
Today Henning T. has 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, it is, he takes medication for depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I had terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, those concerned can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, madness relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear the voice of votes, or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of Psychiatry at Heidelberg Chu (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, the sensory structure and space to the reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ".
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of lived in a real framework.
Why our brain such antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are tiny brain.
It is assumed that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explained.
But what remains unexplained is how the neural system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains.
This is crazy, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take medicines to undo while others buy drugs very expensive for atomic weapons.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years of reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads."
The hallucinations are phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
They include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also the migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer ’ s disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that address the sensory perception, are hyperactives or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the sorrows of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledges having made at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and it goes to high school.
A young girl to normal.
If there was not the images and voices.
During the recess, a young boy, thin, with long hair chestnut, send him the floor.
When she replied his comrades watch, surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl is a lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hear and see the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is seated beside her on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a good feeling, she found that young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, asks sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are burdensome.
When it is in class, it is that it can follow the course because the professor is just present a new student in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly explaining equations in table.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his bedroom, it expects sleep that came too little and too late, it often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on his arms and legs are before his eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, cree to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would for a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years.
It was last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact by Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not enough of stimulation, the probability is high that it has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough, so there was.
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of the other children when she was small and often played alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, the man she called dad, since it was in age to think, was not his real father.
This is the same brain areas that are active for visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for actual impressions and noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. "every experience," according to Kasten "in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for ailments, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor, head of clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy Hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the amendment to the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves which are perceived as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of arousal.
The state of consciousness Oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with Polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience a paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a comprehensive and lasting inability to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of intensive methods and interpretation, in a situation intolerable in itself, an organization that is given to us men, not to sink into none of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of Heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
He was 49 years, when his hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain in intensive care.
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created, visit the places foreign trip in time. It is as old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot in his mind on his health care.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is abducted by a Greek to who takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean Mafia.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic travel are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from travel disorders are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this had been slapped the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes mania, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experience shows how our internal representations of the external reality are fragile even in a state of intelligence.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be very rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
27 years, children will be the result of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO Editions Burda is an intermediate solution: over the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children resume the press group, he said to the newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - a long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company In the hands of children
The two children will inherit to 27 years and are firmly committed to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will thereafter.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with.
This will demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that it is pulling out of the post Président-Directeur-Général in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the Board since 1999.
It was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He held the sector that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was also the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and Finance.
And for the first time this is not a member of the family which is at the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda have 19 and 17 years respectively, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who are left by a bulimia capital, who have made enormous speculation unfortunate, believing that they could climb ever higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never been rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the internet.
It took its five minutes of fame in the United states, when Time magazine the designated as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a price and a monthly subscription very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for twitter, the other with a free data service to life, for six times more expensive than the peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at The event The Web, is The European version of The invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited his grand-frère American, but there is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what the abandonment to data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection of fon) to check his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is time that it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a theory in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable across Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside of his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon so that it does not have the wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without soup.
It is a device connected and pay for its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek proposes already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that it is a more fair to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat the color, she has chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the surrender to Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a model very similar in these two occasions: in addition to their colour, a yellow drawing towards green with bright, both times, consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and mantle, in the same tissue, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
So that ’ s a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and has the same held.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets them very different.
If the decisionmaking function was a thick lace, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories also are different: green shoes to heel average for the first time, and a similar model, but, this time.
The hair has changed: the hair are now records when it was released last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "fertility and career women in spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their careers because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a less stable, earlier couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry in the conjugal life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
The women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed in couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable employment needed more time in their lives for it, which led them to reject the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence largely motherhood, but less the start date of common life, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who have studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with higher average level studies or reverse this programme and give priority to the achievement of a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said mrs delgado.

Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and reviews.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert camus: "in its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual longing, almost physical, the one that I felt without the name: the pleasure against the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence no god."
On Samuel beckett: "nihilistic, allegorical christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with poetic humour, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which nearly killed him."

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved from the APS and not weighing more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they both assenèrent kicking the dog who left seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is a funny to attack a free small animal defence which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and that, when she injuria these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man and, ultimately, any person lower than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another, in a normally quiet neighbourhood.
The dog has Gémi throughout the day.
We obviously complained to the police station in the district although we doubt that this serves to much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in the youth so that they find amusing to mistreat a defenceless animal gives us free of affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where is the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists, like said today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to prevent injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident with two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products still safer" and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative nature.
This new campaign for encouragement of helmets in two wheels, under the motto "to be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that the road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products safe.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' organisation Anfac and of Ganvam manufacturers, dealers.
However, we need to qualify the good news since the reference to the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and trucks to lightweight chassis) 95 have been sold.
The dark clouds that affect their application have not dispelled. indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by limiting bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation and unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
Addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam recalled again the need for the administration to attach special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, for which she calculates a drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now mandatory
As has occurred with the anti-lock brakes ABS and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, the system of emergency brakes will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while in the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, in its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident could not rely on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1,100
The intervention of the aid, Revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the eu, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it calculates that a disaster on four with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device carries the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (zaragoza) were alerted by Nick reilly, the new president of General Motors (gm) europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 – after Javier ortega, the north American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the contingency plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted to the workers and the governments of countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, gm, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group, is increasing in importance.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewelry, engineers are parties of the Porsche Boxster S and succeeded to the thinning of nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the roof automatic which has been replaced by a roof bâché manual, capable of delivering 21 kilos, to employ aluminum doors as those of the gt3, other 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the tank of petrol from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, to mount bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with tyres light of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have relinquished the audio system cdr-30, earning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes doors by the wrists in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box PDK double clutch, the test was carried out on a model to manual transmission of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads in California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour cannot be described as beyond reproach.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car to drive on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light which, at the same time, guarantee security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its Musclesà small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, to recover and grow again its engine...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also communicative as specified, the car will do what will our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Its engine
The sound of his BOXER V6, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the Option "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, with the ruling or success.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The paving of roads that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car Ultralégère, more entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"bag Girl."
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon and occasional starlette line parades of the house, the singer displays his face of bad girl with as many capacity than its bags Chanel.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It girl", it is a "Bag girl".
The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral has won a resounding victory in 91-82 during his visit on the ground hard of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences of the team of Dusko Oliver Ivanovic. It is well ahead of his group, after the big show of Mirza Teletovic which, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the absences of herrmann, oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win the fight.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points scored, determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked from the perimeter, presaged that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with hot wrist.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the team of Alava has chosen the game within Barac and the work of eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause of his return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get out as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "minus six" Splitter assessment was already suggest that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that you win if not easily on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of elias ’, they managed to enter in the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to pick up a few shares entitled to take the air, and it is at this point that arises submachine gun Mirza Teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the assistance of English and Ribas remit the meter to score a reassuring (54-67), and that the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The team of Avala got to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) put authorities on notice that they were tired person take what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y eidson, the best of their team, does not résignèrent and tried to support it since the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players from Ivanovic is not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80-85), the game was performed and the victory outside of Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injury prevented the to do battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece in the face Olympiacos and has given him the top of Group B of the Euroligue, during a match marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, especially in the game inside (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship or by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The first quarter, has led to dream the andalusian. An aggressive defence and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game within bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to overthrow the score 22-20, at the 13th minute, when an action, a beginning of disagreements between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams has led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury the pivot English Joel Freeland and three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their baskets to three points, the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
A rebound impossible.
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed superior and bomber to match the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66 - 48, at the 27th minute, observing the head of the group.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the final exit from the pivotal Scottish Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to his organization, to baskets to three points of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57 in the 31st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was when the players were pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ’ affaires of the Embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 january, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination."
The chain has also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline established: "my position is to leave as soon as possible, naturally with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that it would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled policy that would impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where the officials take decisions on a future uncertain by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets was to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets were virtually finalized and, without jeopardising their political maverick of liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year in the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without measures and we are now seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and business obligations increase again, although they remain very distant from the levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been selected shelters by investors, an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying again to induce a case of awareness among lesresponsables of the global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of the job, whereas what should be done is declaring a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the pot in roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary for non respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government to transparency and make its citizens share of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of spain, as our differences of public debt is increasing to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn not to worry.
If the European and continued to increase, it would be a risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators estimates are forcing most of the services of studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upwards their forecast for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, due to the burden with a Japanese model pourl Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all the air to provide an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for the moment "caution is the mother safety."
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press that he had spoken to the sub-commission,.
For the president of iberdrola, Spain needs to invest eur 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million between this date and 2030, in cases where nuclear power stations today in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be used to increase production capacity, but the distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses both gas and coal, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW of more are needed, with other "energies of support".
Galán, who believes that the bill a sustainable economy that the government has approved is in line with what calls his company, did not wish to attack the royal decree to encourage consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the measures "walk-ins", as qualified the president of Iberdrola.
Anyway, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in australia, on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of brisbane, on the east coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and highways dealer.
The mayor of the city wants to have by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public / private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of SRS & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May next year, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists to work underground.
Against the team of Acciona, shoe the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure Transfield and of the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is divided between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which states in its turn to the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatisation, but there is a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS was just to win a place on the market by his participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Active millionaires
Acciona on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and activity in the sector desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park, one of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and the consolidation of companies responsible for building and managing the Dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure.

It is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that the toll will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not anticipated that the site is completed before 2016.
The tunnel has begun to be designed in 2005.
It will include two times two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers of work to Hochtief
Australia continues to be widely hochtief, who mentioned yesterday obtaining a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary leighton, the national network infrastructure broadband fiber optic.
This intervention will enable 400 000 people to have high-speed Internet access and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given the construction of the tower King George, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The Work has not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale to 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.

With this sanction, the former French monopoly and state-run company, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has been increased because the authority which ensures competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have won 467,4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have earned more money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362,5 million euros to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to information from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well served in this division.
The club white was the third of the continent to receive more money for his participation, and the only one, with the A.C. milan, having won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams, billed the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.

On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards money reported by the Champions league, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1 090 million through the Champions league.
Of this amount, UEFA will million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate have received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who come in eighth final of three million each, the eight teams who reach the final quarter of Reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in europe in august.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, which are enshrined 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four places.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid based on the number of matches played during the edition of the year.

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, garages cars are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought up to a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex.
To calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use such systems.
The suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the North American group, is the business leader; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and of the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them their provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to treat continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, variations and motors have been launched that over the preceding 15 years.
When a new car lots on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very hard work, because it is each thousand pieces of the vehicle and include its price.
In addition, it establishes a graphic image "smart" of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger vehicle.
If it is a model sold heavily, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides comprehensive information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have such information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
On the vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds the 99%.
To do the work of documentation and databases, Audatex has eight centres across the world (in spain, france, germany, the United states, brazil, mexico, China and japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanical) work simultaneously on three screens of computers.
Audatex invests each year, 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and propose various products.
The most common application for the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are also tools for the management of pieces of breaks or to calculate the residual value or a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex suggests not in our country, but it is in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can bring to professionals in the sector.
This company offers 10 different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution assessment, for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the scales of paint.
This tool is bought in terms of its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use little, the maximum 10 times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which makes thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which he came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number.
Audaglass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is open to the professional sector server on the Internet to bid on vehicles reported wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, analyses géo-démographiques or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific Mark went to the garage for a breakdown or how many had suffered serious losses for a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to documents, price and time records of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the group Einsa, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance devoiture.
The guide GT assessment is a product of historical reference on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and has a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.

Since 2007, it is part of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the benchmark Standard & Poor's.
Internet auction of rugged
Last October, the group has purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation has involved a cost of 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to 15 per cent.
The purpose of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its clients, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This estimate and sale is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, leasing companies, garages, the scrapyard and sellers professionals who must be registered before starting to conduct operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its major markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 announcements by day and on the Spanish market, 100 new announcements are published every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been withdrawn can no longer move, but on the other hand, some parts which are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
The vintage cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex approaches.
Garage in four stages
With the tool Auda-taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user obtains a quotation in only four stages: identify the vehicle, the replacement part, create a quotation and generate.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the oldest professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 Tourism, 109, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and trucks.
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection is required.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question is then selects the necessary.
The user can include variables such as the price of labour, increases or reductions, then it can print the specifications for the client.
Audataller is not a tool to estimate as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that for garages does not include the time of Labour estimated.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which may be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turn to see the inside.
